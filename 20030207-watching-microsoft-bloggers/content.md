I guess people are checking out [Microsoft
Watch](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,4248,852932,00.asp). 79
referrals today! I also got a few interesting googles today : “[passion
technology](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&hl=zh-tw&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=passion+technology)“,
“[windows informix online
multi-query](http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=windows+informix+online+"multi-query"&meta=)”
(from Germany no less) and my favorite: “[activeup
crack](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=activeup+crack)“.
DevHawk is the only site that comes up when google for “[activeup
crack](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=activeup+crack&btnG=Google+Search)“.
I’m not sure – is that a good thing?
