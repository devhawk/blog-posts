<p>I guess people are checking out <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,4248,852932,00.asp">Microsoft

referrals today! I also got a few interesting googles today : “<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;hl=zh-tw&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=passion+technology">passion
technology</a>“,
“<a href="http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=windows+informix+online+%22multi-query%22&amp;meta=">windows informix online
multi-query</a>”
(from Germany no less) and my favorite: “<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=activeup+crack">activeup
crack</a>“.
DevHawk is the only site that comes up when google for “<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=activeup+crack&amp;btnG=Google+Search">activeup
crack</a>“.
I’m not sure – is that a good thing?
