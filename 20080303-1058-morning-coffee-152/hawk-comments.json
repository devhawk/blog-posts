    "content": "I've been pretty interested lately on distributed control version systems; and I'm looking at both Git and Mercurial. Git seems technically the better one, but the Windows support seems to be still a bit lacking (and not sure why neither of them have a simple binary distribution on a zip file; why mess with installers?).\n\nAnyway, I think the concept is a great idea; and the one thing I really like about it is that it combines the offline support (even better, since pretty much all operations are available offline, not just a few) of SVN, with actual support for branches/merges, and, even better, easy way to provide for personal temporary branches, which is really the only TFS feature I miss every now and then (I'm of course talking about shelvesets)."
