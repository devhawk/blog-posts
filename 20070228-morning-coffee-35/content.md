Not sure why, but it’s a very slow day in the blogoshpere

-   Quote of the Day: “I get paid for people to tell me I’m full of
    shit” – [Nick Malik](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik)
-   The Architecture Journal has a new
    [website](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/arcjournal). Looks very cool. I
    might have blogged this before, but [Journal
    10](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/arcjournal/bb232818.aspx) is about
    composite applications.
-   Latest [CTP drop of
    Orcas](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=cf76fcba-07af-47ac-8822-4ad346210670)
    is out (downloadable VPC is
    [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=b533619a-0008-4dd6-9ed1-47d482683c78)).
    I’m glad DevDiv is providing this level of transparency, but I’m
    waiting for Beta 1. (via [Sam
    Gentile](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/02/28/It_2700_s-Out_21002100_-Code-Name-_2200_Orcas_2200_-_2D00_-March-Community-Technology-Preview-_2800_CTP_2900_.aspx))
-   Here’s a chance to try out
    [OpenCongress](http://www.opencongress.org): HR 1201, the “Freedom
    and Innovation Revitalizing U.S. Entrepreneurship” (or FAIR USE) Act
    [which will dials back
    DCMA](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2007/02/digital_fair_use_bill_introduc.html) though
    Ars Technica is [not
    impressed](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070227-8934.html).
    It’s not on OpenCongress yet, but you should eventually be able to
    track FAIR USE
    [here](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h1201/show).
-   Two months into 2007 and I seem to be keeping with my average of one
    post a day. 28 days in February has resulted in 29 posts (and the
    day ain’t over yet!). Of course, this month some of the credit goes
    to [Dale](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/) for keeping things
    going while I vacationed.
