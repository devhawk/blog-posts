<p>I didn’t notice, but the Advanced Networking Pack for WinXP was released
last week. It’s available on Windows Update, or you can
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/list/winxppeer.asp">download</a> it as
well as the SDK from MSDN. The API is C based. That’s right. Not COM,
not managed, not even C++ objects. Like I
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/07/21/messenger-net-futures/">said</a> about
the RTC Client v1.2 API, this API is ripe for wrapping in managed code.</p>
