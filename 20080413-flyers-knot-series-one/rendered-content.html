<p>Ever hear the phrase “if you don’t have anything nice to say, then don’t
say anything at all”? That’s about how I feel about the Caps effort in
<a href="http://www2.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&amp;page=Recap&amp;gameNumber=132&amp;season=20072008&amp;gameType=3">this afternoon’s
loss</a>
to the Flyers.</p>
<p>There are two possible explanations for today’s game:</p>
<ol>
<li>After going 11-1 to finish the season and coming from behind in the
third period of <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/04/11/caps-win-game-one-with-a-three-goal-third/">game
one</a>,
the Caps were just emotionally drained and couldn’t get up for
today’s game.</li>
<li>The Flyers have figured out how to shut the Caps down completely.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I think it’s explanation #1. If it’s #2, it’s gonna be a
short series.</p>
<p>I had written a bunch of observations, but go <a href="http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2008/04/game-2-recap-flyers-2-caps-0.html">read Japers
instead</a>.
He hit all the points I was going to and more.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I almost forgot, good to see Patrick Thoresen (the Flyer who
took a Mike Green Slapshot to the groin Friday) <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3343675">wasn’t as seriously
hurt</a>
as initially thought.</p>
