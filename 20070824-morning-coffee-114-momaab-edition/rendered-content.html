<li>We spent all day yesterday discussing four topics: SaaS, Tools for
Scrum, Web 2.0 and Domain Specific Languages. Even though it was
just a day, my brain is full. These were deep and challenging
discussion. I need to let the discussions stew a bit before posting
anything about them here. But I will.</li>
<li>Next time we do one of these, I’m bringing a video camera. I took
notes, but looking over them the next morning they seem woefully
incomplete. OneNote’s <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/CH102381791033.aspx">integrated audio/video recording
capabilities</a>
would nicely augment my notes.</li>
<li>We ran this meeting using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open
Space</a>, and it
worked very well. Of course, we only had 8 people, so we didn’t need
a lot of process to self organize. However, it did whet my appetite
for having a larger Open Space style un-conference for architects.
Is that something other folks might be interested in?</li>
<li>Major thanks to the folks at <a href="http://www.claritycon.com/">Clarity
Consulting</a> who graciously gave us space
to meet and fed us yesterday. Their CTO <a href="http://blogs.claritycon.com/blogs/jon_rauschenberger/default.aspx">Jon
Rauschenberger</a>
sat in on most of our meeting, and drove our Web 2.0 discussion. I
said I wanted to stew a bit on the discussions, but <a href="http://www.claritycon.com/arcready">Jon’s
slides</a> are available on line if
you’re interested.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.traceofthought.net/">Scott Colestock</a> showed me
<a href="http://www.diigo.com/">Diigo</a>, a social annotation tool. Where
del.icio.us lets you tag and annotate individual pages, Diigo lets
you annotate and highlight specific parts of the page. They also
have <a href="http://www.diigo.com/help/blog/2">blogging tools</a>, where these
annotations and highlights become blog posts, but they <a href="http://www.diigo.com/help/blog/3">don’t
support dasBlog</a>. However, since
FeedBurner doesn’t support Diigo for <a href="http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2004/08/introducing_the_link_splicer.php">link
splicing</a>,
I’m afraid my use of it will be limited.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/architect/bios/jim_wilt/default.mspx">Jim
Wilt</a>
introduced me to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831501">Virtual PC’s command
line</a>. He recommends using
“-pc &lt;vpc name&gt; -launch -singlepc” which launches a single virtual
environment without the VPC console. I rarely run more than one VPC
at a time and I hate stuff cluttering up my taskbar and notification
area, so I like this a lot.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.inrule.com/Management_Team.aspx">Loren Goodman</a>
demonstrated the <a href="http://www.thedotnetfactory.com/SharePointExplorerClient.aspx">SharePoint Explorer
Client</a>.
SharePoint &amp; MOSS came up several times in all of our topics, so
this is going to get a second look. I always thought it was strange
that MSFT ships a <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointdesigner/default.aspx">smart client for
editing</a>
WSS &amp; MOSS, but not viewing it. SP Explorer looks like it fills that
gap nicely.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sysknowlogy.com/">Shannon Braun</a> sent us all a link to
<a href="http://www.nealwhittengroup.com/articles/pmn10-99.asp">the 50/70
rule</a>, which
seems like a good rule of thumb. Of course, assuming that things
won’t progress linearly is almost always a good rule of thumb. But
the 50/70 rule has reasoning behind the assumption.</li>
<li>Chicago is nice, but the weather has been a little freaky. It’s
either been hot &amp; humid, downporing thunderstorms or
<a href="http://www.wandtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=6974859">tornados</a>. <a href="http://www.kavp.com/">Keith
Powell</a> showed me
<a href="http://flightaware.com/">FlightAware</a>, which shows you flight
departure and arrival history. My flight hasn’t left within an hour
of scheduled departure in a week. I’m going to try and grab an
earlier flight, but I have a feeling it’s going to be a long trip
home.</li>
