I’m sitting in the back of the room listening to Jack present the
Factories overview for the [DSL
Tutorial](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=141). I’ve seen
most of the content for this session before, but not brought together
like this. Currently, he’s talking about mapping business capabilities
to system requirements. I’ve started to see quite a bit of discussion of
mapping business capabilities recently. Gurpreet [talked about
it](http://devhawk.net/2004/09/15/gurpreet-on-enterprise-architecture/)
in his EA session n Malaysia. Jack Calhoun also [talked about
it](http://devhawk.net/2004/10/13/saf-day-2/)
at SAF. Memo to self – more transparency around business capability
mapping.

BTW, check out [Michael Lehman’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/).
Michael has been building (it’s not really done) the [factories
demo](http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2004/10/16/243389.aspx)
for the tutorial. He’s got some great points about
[DSL’s](http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/09/23/233402.aspx),
[abstraction](http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/09/27/234778.aspx)
and [product
lines](http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/10/03/237199.aspx).
As I type this, he’s demoing expanding an e-commerce factory template
inside of VS.NET. Cool stuff. I expect him to be blogging a lot more
about building factories after this week.
