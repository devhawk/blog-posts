-   The biggest news of the week IMHO is Soma
    [announcing](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/17/f-a-functional-programming-language.aspx)
    the formation of an F\# product team. Specifically, they will “fully
    integrate the F\# language into Visual Studio and continue
    innovating and evolving F\#.” Though Soma calls F\# “another
    first-class programming language on the CLR”, I get the feeling
    there won’t be a “Visual F\#” sku. Don Syme has [more on the
    news](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/17/s-somasegar-on-taking-f-forward.aspx).
-   In other Soma [announcement
    news](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/18/popfly-beta.aspx),
    [Popfly](http://www.popfly.com/) is now in beta. More [details on
    what’s
    new](http://popflyteam.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!51018025071FD37F!264.entry)
    on the Popfly Team Blog. I haven’t played with Popfly in depth, but
    I think it’s got huge potential.

    [details](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/14/asp-net-mvc-framework.aspx)
    the upcoming ASP.NET MVC Framework. Personally, I’m not building web
    apps much these days, so I’m not really invested one way or the
    other. Given the interest in this approach, it’s nice to see the
    ASP.NET team respond to the market, though I’m sure someone will
    complain that we’re trying to kill off the various open-source MVC
    Web frameworks that have sprung up.
-   Over in Windows Live, they [shipped a new
    version](http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!2BBC66E99FDCDB98!9276.entry)
    of Live Search Maps,
    [upgraded](http://blogs.msdn.com/pix/archive/2007/10/18/do-you-use-flickr-then-check-out-windows-live-photo-gallery-beta.aspx)
    WL Photo Gallery (which I’ve been digging) to support Flickr and
    shipped an [update to WL
    Accounts](http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2007/10/18/update-to-windows-live-account-enables-linked-ids.aspx)
    which allows you to link accounts.
-   The Clarius folks keep churning out great tools for software factory
    developers. The latest is the [T4 editor](http://www.t4editor.net/),
    which brings intellisense, color syntax highlighting and property
    inspector support for Text Templating Transformation Toolkit (aka
    T4) files. T4 files are used for code generation in both [DSL
    Toolkit](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718368.aspx)
    and
    [GAT](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718948.aspx).
-   David Pallman (again via [Sam
    Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/10/09/new-and-notable-196.aspx))
    [suggests](http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!266.entry)
    there are only three choices for infrastructure architecture:
    None/Point-to-point, Centralized/Hub-and-Spoke and Thin/Bus. I get
    the first two, but his explanation of the third goes to far into the
    “magic framework” category for my taste. “Physically distributed but
    logically centralized”? That doesn’t make any sense to me at all.
-   Fellowship of the Ring [makes its way onto
    XBLM](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/marketplace/moviestv/newline.htm).
    Alas, not in HD so I’ll stick w/ my [extended four hour DVD
    version](http://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-Fellowship-Platinum-Extended/dp/B000067DNF)
    thankyouverymuch.
