Rumsfeld said “[We will win this war](http://msnbc.com/news/965704.asp)”
on Meet the Press today. Funny, I thought we [already
had](http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2003/iraq/war.tracker/05.01.index.html).

I’ve been reading “[LIES: And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them—A Fair and
Balanced Look at the Right](http://al-franken.com/book.html)” by [Al
Franken](http://al-franken.com). Very funny, except when you think about
what the current administration has done to this country. Then, it’s
depressing.
