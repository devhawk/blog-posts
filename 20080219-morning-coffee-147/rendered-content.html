The big treat was his cousin Jack
coming up for a visit. Here’s a picture of the two of them at
Patrick’s party on Saturday. My wife has <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!2040.entry">all the
details</a>
on her blog. <strong>Update</strong>: My wife just <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!2065.entry">posted a whole
slew</a>
of Early Patrick Pictures.</li>
<li>If my son is five, it means this blog is also five – I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/01/14/new-and-improved-devhawk/">started this
blog</a>
about a month before <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/02/23/welcome-patrick/">Patrick was
born</a>. I never
remember to mark the occasion until Paddy boy’s big day comes
around.</li>
<li>Major props to the House of Representatives for growing a backbone
and <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Bush_I_will_not_accept_any_0213.html">not
caving</a>
to President 30% Approval on telecom immunity…yet. Personally, I’d
like to see the House bury the measure completely, though I’m not
holding my breath. But given that even the right-wing Washington
Times reports “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080216/NATION/847451166/1002">Analysts say FISA will
suffice</a>“,
maybe the House Dems will do the right thing.</li>
<li>After tearing it up since Thanksgiving, the Caps have gone a little
cold. 5-4-1 in their last ten and 2-2-1 in their last five. In the
month of February, they’re 1-3-1 against SE division opponents. Good
news is that they’re still even with Carolina (two points behind
with two games in hand), half a game up on Atlanta, a game and a
half up on Florida and two and a half games up on Tampa Bay.</li>
<li>Bill Gates <a href="http://channel8.msdn.com/Posts/2047/">announced</a> a new
program called <a href="https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/">DreamSpark</a> to
provide college students access to all of Microsoft’s developer and
designer tools, including Visual Studio, Expression, SQL Server,
Windows Server and XNA Creators Club membership. This looks like an
outgrowth of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/academic/default.aspx">MSDN Academic
Alliance</a>
program. I think it’s a great idea. <strong>Update</strong>: Looks like <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_8302312">high-school
students</a> will be able to
access the DreamSpark program too. However, since they’re minors,
they have to get the software via their teachers. (via

<li>The winners of the <a href="http://dreambuildplay.com/main/winners.aspx">XNA Silicon Minds
contest</a> have been
announced. Of the five winners,
<a href="http://www.strandyfamily.com/Specimen/">Specimen</a> looks the coolest
to me. I wish I had more time to get into game development. (Via

<li>Speaking of game development, this week is the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Development
Conference</a>, so be on the lookout for lots
of game-related news. Xbox Live VP John Schappert is giving a
<a href="http://www.gdconf.com/conference/keynotes.htm">keynote</a> on
“Unleashing the Creative Community”. XNA GM Chris Satchell <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16618">said
last
year</a>
they would “announce full details on, and … vision for, opening XNA
creations to the community” sometime this year. I’m guessing this is
said announcement.</li>
<li>Speaking of Xbox, there’s a
<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23214808/">rumor</a> that Microsoft and
Netflix will announce this week that Netflix is bringing their Watch
Instantly service to Xbox 360. If true, sign me up!</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/default.aspx">Grigori Melnik</a> announces
the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/02/15/gax-gat-february-2008-final-release.aspx">GAX/GAT February 2008 final
release</a>.
Key feature is VS08 support. Is it just me, or does calling it the
“final release” make it sound like they won’t be upgrading GAX/GAT
further?</li>
<li>Speaking of p&amp;p, Grigori also announces the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/02/12/unity-february-2008-community-technology-preview.aspx">Feb 2008 CTP of
Unity</a>,
p&amp;p’s new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control">IoC</a>
container. I’ve seem lots of folks echoing the announcement, but not
much in the way of specifics on Unity itself. For example, Chris
Brandsma <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2008/02/17/microsoft-releases-unity-an-ioc-library/">describes IoC and mentions
Unity</a>,
but he doesn’t cover any Unity specifics.

<li>MSIT EA Nilesh Bhide has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nileshb">started
blogging</a>. His first post is on
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nileshb/archive/2008/01/29/customer-perception-of-service-quality-in-s-s-saas.aspx">Customer perception of Service Quality in
S+S/SaaS</a>.
I’ve worked closely with Nilesh in the past two years, so I’m
excited to see him take to the blogosphere. (via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2008/02/13/want-the-software-quality-attributes-of-a-service-ask-the-customer.aspx">Nick

<li>I don’t know how I missed it, but the <a href="http://code.msdn.com/">MSDN Code
Gallery</a> launched last month. As Charlie
Calvert
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/01/28/code-gallery-goes-live-new-site-for-samples.aspx">explained</a>,
this is logical successor to GotDotNet’s user samples area. Between
Code Gallery and <a href="http://codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>, GotDotNet has
finally been shuttered for good.</li>
<li>Telligent, makers of the very popular <a href="http://communityserver.org/">Community
Server</a>, have released <a href="http://graffiticms.com/">Graffiti
CMS</a>, which looks like a more flexible
content platform than Community Server. (via
<a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/products/Graffiti_1_0_Released">DNK</a>)</li>
<li>In somewhat unexpected news (at least, unexpected by me) Microsoft
has released specs for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx">Office <em>binary</em> file
formats</a>.
I’m not sure why this is happening now, rather than say when we
released the specs for the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/news/TC45_current_work/TC45_available_docs.htm">Open Office XML file
formats</a>.
