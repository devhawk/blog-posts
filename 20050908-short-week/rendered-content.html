<p>After blogging quite a bit last week, I’ve been to busy to blog this
week. Between the Labor day holiday Monday and leaving for PDC tomorrow,
it’s a short week with lots to do. I’m going to PDC several days
early because my family is coming with me and we’re visiting friends and
family who still live in LA. Patrick is very excited to be going on a
“sky tuka-tuka” i.e. “sky train” i.e. airplane.</p>
<p>Next week will be more of the same from me around here. I’m not going to
many sessions – I can get the content on the post conference DVD or
simply by emailing the speaker or team directly. PDC is more about
hanging out in the community lounge areas the connecting with the other
attendees. (Well, that and presenting at the Architecture Symposium.) So
I won’t be blogging about cool new technology, but you might see the
occasional post about a conversation I had with another attendee. Every
time I talk to a customer is an opportunity to learn something and
expand my thinking, and PDC represents a great opportunity for lots of
conversations.</p>
