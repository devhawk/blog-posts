I got a pointer to [Mondrain](http://www.mondrian-script.org/) off the
[Dotnet-sscli](https://mailserver.di.unipi.it/mailman/listinfo/dotnet-sscli)
mailing list yesterday. Mondrain is one of a
[few](http://research.microsoft.com/projects/sml.net/)
[functional](http://www.mondrian-script.org/mondrian/doc/haskell.html)
[languages](http://research.microsoft.com/projects/ilx/fsharp.htm)
implementations for .NET. Thereâ€™s also some interesting study of
[CodeDom](http://www.mondrian-script.org/codedom/index.html), including
a formal description of the
[grammar](http://www.mondrian-script.org/codedom/CodeDom%20Grammar.html).
Just the thing for building [Disruptive Programming Language
Technologies](http://devhawk.net/2003/01/17/disruptive-programming-language-technologies/).
