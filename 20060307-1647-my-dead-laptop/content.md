So between this mornings [multi-touch interface
demo](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/9091 "multi-touch interface demo")
and the session on [Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
service](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8267 "Amazon's Mechanical Turk service"),
my laptop died. At least, the display did. Sometimes I can get it to
work for a short time by closing and re-opening the lid. But in the
constant jostling environment of a confernce audience, getting it to
keep working has proved impossible.

Of course this couldn’t happen while I’m at home with convienent access
to the help desk. I’m at the Emerging Tech conferences for pete sake!

I would have just bought a laptop at CompUSA or something, but that
qualifies as a captial expenditure and my boss wouldn’t sign off on it
(primarily because of the paperwork he’d have to fill out). Luckily,
[CRE Rentals](http://www.computerrentals.com/ "CRE Rentals") was able to
get a machine over to me in a few hours so I’m back online. I guess I
won’t be doing any more coding this trip, but I guess I’ll survive.

More from ETech later. In the meantime, check out Ray Ozzie’s blog entry
on [Wiring the
Web](http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry).
I may be biased, but it’s the coolest new thing I’ve seen here so far
(though the multi-touch interface is pretty awesome too)
