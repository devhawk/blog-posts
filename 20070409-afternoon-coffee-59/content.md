Friday’s Morning Coffee didn’t happen because I fraked up the DNS
settings when I moved devhawk.net to a new registrar. Today’s morning
coffee was drastically delayed on account of car troubles. Tuesday, I
have an 8am meeting so tomorrow’s not looking good either.

-   The big news for Xbox 360 is details on the [Spring
    Update](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0408-im.htm).
    Big news is WLMessenger integration + a [QWERTY thumb
    pad](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gamerscore/451798354/) that snaps
    right into the controller. (via
    [Gamerscoreblog](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/04/08/543788.aspx)
    and [Major
    Nelson](http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/04/08/details-of-the-may-07-dash-update.aspx))
-   Speaking of Xbox, I completed the [Old Spice Experience
    Challenge](http://xboxrewards.msgamestudios.com/challengesandrewards/ChallengeDetail.aspx?id=4) today
    on my lunch break (couldn’t go to the office due to the car
    troubles). My reward is an upgrade to level 2, a gamerpic I’ll never
    use and a free copy of
    [Contra](http://www.xbox.com/games/contraxboxlivearcade/).
    (Estimated total value: \$5)
-   Scott Guthrie continues his series on new language features in
    C\#3/VB9. This time it’s [lambda
    expressions](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/04/08/new-orcas-language-feature-lambda-expressions.aspx).
    This is the “killer” feature in the new language version IMHO, since
    you can use lambda expressions either as code or data. Furthermore,
    it’s up to the class/method handling the lambda expression to decide
    if it should be treated as code or data. That decision is made and
    design time, but the upside is that as a developer, I write my
    queries exactly the same way regardless if they are to be executed
    directly (aka code) or analyzed (aka data). Scott also metions a few
    new LINQ to \* projects: [LINQ to
    Amazon](http://linqinaction.net/blogs/main/archive/2006/09/07/Linq_to_Amazon_source_code.aspx),
    [LINQ to
    NHibernate](http://blogs.magiconsoftware.com/blogs/bdiaz/archive/2007/04/03/implementing-linq-for-nhibernate-part-3-aggregate-and-element-operators.aspx)
    and [LINQ to
    LDAP](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2007/04/07/the-iqueryable-tales-linq-to-ldap-part-3-why-do-we-need-entities.aspx).
-   Speaking of LINQ to \*, here’s [LINQ to 3D
    Objects](http://blogs.msdn.com/lukeh/archive/2007/04/03/a-ray-tracer-in-c-3-0.aspx)
    in a C\# ray tracer. I think it’s safe to say that LINQ
    to \*whatever\* is the new hotness. (via
    [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/csharp/Ray_Tracing_in_C_3_0))
-   The [new version of
    F\#](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/04/06/f-1-9-1-released.aspx)
    is out. Looks like the big new feature is Active Patterns which is
    described in this [draft
    paper](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/04/07/draft-paper-on-f-active-patterns.aspx).
    If I only had more time to investigate this. (via [Don
    Syme](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme))
-   For the third time in the past six months, my laptop power supply
    has died. I’ve never had a problem like this before, much less three
    times. It’s not even the same laptop as I recently moved over to a
    Tecra M4 Tablet. I just don’t get it.
-   P&P has shipped the 3.0 release of [Enterprise
    Library](http://codeplex.com/entlib). Tom Hollander [has the
    details](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2007/04/05/just-released-enterprise-library-3-0-april-2007.aspx).
    Personally, I am most interested in the new [Policy Injection
    Block](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2007/02/23/announcing-the-policy-injection-application-block.aspx).
-   Having worked with self-signed certificates and understanding what a
    PITA they are, it’s nice to see that IIS 7 has [explicit support for
    them](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/04/06/tip-trick-enabling-ssl-on-iis7-using-self-signed-certificates.aspx).
-   I saw a reference to “[The Halo
    Effect](http://www.amazon.com/Halo-Effect-Business-Delusions-Managers/dp/0743291255)”
    on one of the [political blogs I
    read](http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/halo-effect-and-efficiency-in-business.html).
    Needless to say, as an Xbox gamer, my first reaction was that this
    had something related to Master Chief. It doesn’t.
-   Joe McKendrick compares [SOA governance to national
    governance](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=850). Given
    our polarized political climate, this analogy may hurt more than it
    helps. Also, the next enterprise architectural board that has equal
    “branch” footing with IT and executive management will be the first.
