I just sat thru the flash demo for [BizTalk Server
2004](http://www.microsoft.com/biztalk/beta/). While itâ€™s pretty fluffy,
it did show glimpses of the new BTS tools integrated into VS.NET and
integration with InfoPath for supporting human based workflows. Cool
stuff. Downloading from [MSDN Subscriber
Downloads](http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/resources/subdwnld.asp)
as I blog.
