<li>Big news on the WGA strike front: the AMPTP <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20172430,00.html">reached a
deal</a> with the
Directors Guild last weeks. Initial reaction from United Hollywood
is
<a href="http://unitedhollywood.blogspot.com/2008/01/first-glance-at-deal-summary.html">mixed</a>,
but I’m hopeful this will at least get the AMPTP / WGA talks started
again.</li>
<li>Speaking of new media, Xbox 360 Fanboy has a
<a href="http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/01/16/sundance-short-films-coming-to-video-marketplace/">rundown</a>
of 45 short films from Sundance that are getting released on Xbox
Live Marketplace. That’s pretty a-typical content for XBLM.
Typically, new content on XBLM has been from “<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/jan08/01-06ABCMGMXboxLivePR.mspx">Hollywood
Heavyweights</a>“.
I’m pretty excited to see them branch out content wise.</li>
<li>Speaking of Xbox 360, seems <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/01/17/556724.aspx">they had a good
year</a>.
Congrats!</li>
<li>Still speaking of Xbox 360, everyone <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/01/18/UndertowFreeofCharge.aspx">gets a free copy of
Undertow</a>
this week.</li>
<li>Scott Guthrie
<a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/01/18/UndertowFreeofCharge.aspx">announces</a>
the availability of the .NET Framework Source Code. Shawn Burke has
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2008/01/16/configuring-visual-studio-to-debug-net-framework-source-code.aspx">instructions</a>
for how to use it with VS08. So far, they’ve made the core base
class libraries, ASP.NET, Windows Forms, WPF, ADO.NET and XML
available. LINQ, WCF and WF are expected to become available “in the
weeks and months ahead”.</li>
<li>Ted Neward wonders if Java is <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/15/Java+QuotDonequot+Like+The+Patriots+Or+QuotDonequot+Like+The+Dolphins.aspx">“Done” like the Patriots, or “Done”
like the
Dolphins?</a>
If you want my opinion (I’m guessing yes, since you’re reading my
blog), definitely done like the Dolphins.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK">OpenJDK</a> was a desperation
move to make Java “cool” again, but it won’t work. People who want
an open source stack are using LAMP and language wonks who saw Java
as mainstream SmallTalk have moved on to Ruby. The question will be
if <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html">Sun buying
MySQL</a>
will make Sun cool or MySQL uncool by association. I’m guessing the
latter.</li>
<li>Speaking of Ted, he’s got a great post about the <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/17/Youre+Without+A+Point+Mr+Zachmann.aspx">relevance of game
programming</a>
to the mainstream or enterprise developer.</li>
<li>Speaking of game development, David Weller points to all the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/LetsKillDave/%7E3/218525110/tons-of-content-for-xna-game-studio-2-0.aspx">new
XNA GS 2.0
content</a>
up on <a href="http://creators.xna.com/">Creators Club Online</a>.</li>
<li>There’s a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/7ac148a7-149b-4056-aa06-1e6754efd36f/Details.aspx">new version (1.9.3.14) of F#
out</a>,
but no announcement from
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/default.aspx">Don</a> regarding what’s
new. I reviewed the release notes, seems like this is primarily a
bug-fix release with only very minor feature additions.</li>
<li>Speaking of F#, Don points to <a href="http://sky.fit.qut.edu.au/%7Eneverov/">Greg
Neverov’s</a> implementation of
<a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/hell_is_other_languages/archive/2008/01/16/4565.aspx">Software Transactional Memory in
F#</a>.
This immediately reminded me of <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/13/the-next-mainstream-programming-language/">Tim Sweeney’s Next Mainstream
Programming Language
talk</a>.
Tim suggested said language would need to support a combination of
side-effect free functional code and software transactional memory.
F# is looking to be closer to that language all the time.</li>
<li>Still speaking of F#, Don Syme’s <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/01/17/expert-f-now-available-really.aspx">Expert
F#</a>
book is out. I read the draft version – it rocks – but I’m still
going to get my own real copy. You should too.</li>
<li>With their <a href="http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20072008/GS020711.HTM">win
Saturday</a>,
the Caps are back to .500 for the first time since late October.
Since Thanksgiving, the <a href="http://peerlessprognosticator.blogspot.com/2008/01/caps-fansthe-only-power-ranking-youll.html">Caps are
15-7-4</a>.
Only four teams in the league have a better record over that time
span. We play one of them tonight – <a href="http://www2.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&amp;page=Preview&amp;gameNumber=725&amp;season=20072008&amp;gameType=2">the
Penguins</a>
– and it’s on <a href="http://www.versus.com/nhl/">Versus</a>, so I’ll even get
to see it. In HD no less.</li>
</ul>
