-   Big news on the WGA strike front: the AMPTP [reached a
    deal](http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20172430,00.html) with the
    Directors Guild last weeks. Initial reaction from United Hollywood
    is
    [mixed](http://unitedhollywood.blogspot.com/2008/01/first-glance-at-deal-summary.html),
    but I’m hopeful this will at least get the AMPTP / WGA talks started
    again.
-   Speaking of new media, Xbox 360 Fanboy has a
    [rundown](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/01/16/sundance-short-films-coming-to-video-marketplace/)
    of 45 short films from Sundance that are getting released on Xbox
    Live Marketplace. That’s pretty a-typical content for XBLM.
    Typically, new content on XBLM has been from “[Hollywood
    Heavyweights](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/jan08/01-06ABCMGMXboxLivePR.mspx)“.
    I’m pretty excited to see them branch out content wise.
-   Speaking of Xbox 360, seems [they had a good
    year](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/01/17/556724.aspx).
    Congrats!
-   Still speaking of Xbox 360, everyone [gets a free copy of
    Undertow](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/01/18/UndertowFreeofCharge.aspx)
    this week.
-   Scott Guthrie
    [announces](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/01/18/UndertowFreeofCharge.aspx)
    the availability of the .NET Framework Source Code. Shawn Burke has
    [instructions](http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2008/01/16/configuring-visual-studio-to-debug-net-framework-source-code.aspx)
    for how to use it with VS08. So far, they’ve made the core base
    class libraries, ASP.NET, Windows Forms, WPF, ADO.NET and XML
    available. LINQ, WCF and WF are expected to become available “in the
    weeks and months ahead”.
-   Ted Neward wonders if Java is [“Done” like the Patriots, or “Done”
    like the
    Dolphins?](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/15/Java+QuotDonequot+Like+The+Patriots+Or+QuotDonequot+Like+The+Dolphins.aspx)
    If you want my opinion (I’m guessing yes, since you’re reading my
    blog), definitely done like the Dolphins.
    [OpenJDK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK) was a desperation
    move to make Java “cool” again, but it won’t work. People who want
    an open source stack are using LAMP and language wonks who saw Java
    as mainstream SmallTalk have moved on to Ruby. The question will be
    if [Sun buying
    MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html)
    will make Sun cool or MySQL uncool by association. I’m guessing the
    latter.
-   Speaking of Ted, he’s got a great post about the [relevance of game
    programming](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/17/Youre+Without+A+Point+Mr+Zachmann.aspx)
    to the mainstream or enterprise developer.
-   Speaking of game development, David Weller points to all the [new
    XNA GS 2.0
    content](http://letskilldave.com/archive/2008/01/17/tons-of-content-for-xna-game-studio-2-0.aspx)
    up on [Creators Club Online](http://creators.xna.com/).
-   There’s a [new version (1.9.3.14) of F\#
    out](http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/7ac148a7-149b-4056-aa06-1e6754efd36f/Details.aspx),
    but no announcement from
    [Don](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/default.aspx) regarding what’s
    new. I reviewed the release notes, seems like this is primarily a
    bug-fix release with only very minor feature additions.
-   Speaking of F\#, Don points to [Greg
    Neverov’s](http://sky.fit.qut.edu.au/~neverov/) implementation of
    [Software Transactional Memory in
    F\#](http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/hell_is_other_languages/archive/2008/01/16/4565.aspx).
    This immediately reminded me of [Tim Sweeney’s Next Mainstream
    Programming Language
    talk](http://devhawk.net/2006/02/13/the-next-mainstream-programming-language/).
    Tim suggested said language would need to support a combination of
    side-effect free functional code and software transactional memory.
    F\# is looking to be closer to that language all the time.
-   Still speaking of F\#, Don Syme’s [Expert
    F\#](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/01/17/expert-f-now-available-really.aspx)
    book is out. I read the draft version – it rocks – but I’m still
    going to get my own real copy. You should too.
-   With their [win
    Saturday](http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20072008/GS020711.HTM),
    the Caps are back to .500 for the first time since late October.
    Since Thanksgiving, the [Caps are
    15-7-4](http://peerlessprognosticator.blogspot.com/2008/01/caps-fansthe-only-power-ranking-youll.html).
    Only four teams in the league have a better record over that time
    span. We play one of them tonight – [the
    Penguins](http://www2.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Preview&gameNumber=725&season=20072008&gameType=2)
    – and it’s on [Versus](http://www.versus.com/nhl/), so I’ll even get
    to see it. In HD no less.
