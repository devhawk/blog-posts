<p>So I said
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/08/30/architecture-at-the-intersection/">yesterday</a>
that I’m talking about architecture, not architects. However, today I am
going to discuss the word architect and the dramatic misuse of the word
I see pretty regularly. Or at least, I see now because <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/blogs/">Paul
Preiss</a> of
<a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/">IASA</a> mentioned it when we were hanging
out at TechEd.</p>
<p>“Architect” is a noun, not a verb.</p>
<p>Usually, when I hear the term “architect” used as a verb, it’s being
used as a synonym for design. In fact, the term “architecture” is also
often used as a synonym for design. For example, Arnon wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Architecture is design (but not all design is architecture)<br />
[Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz, <a href="http://www.rgoarchitects.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,6c1fc5b2-5c07-4675-b29d-eb8882cd8715.aspx">What’s “Software
Architecture”?</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Fowler’s description I talked about on Monday, I don’t like this
one much either. Architecture isn’t just “good design” which is what
Arnon’s description makes it sound like. This begins to get into the
title inflation that Alan Cooper <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/vsm/2003_09_14th/magazine/departments/softwarearchitect/default_pf.aspx">wrote
about</a>
a few years ago. Speaking of Alan, here’s his definition of architect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The panoply of software construction includes three vital roles: the
programmer, the engineer, and the architect. The architect is
responsible for determining who the user is, what he or she is trying
to accomplish, and what behavior the software must exhibit to satisfy
these human goals. The engineer’s responsibilities are comparable but
focused on technology. A good engineer can and should ignore human
issues, confident that the architect will cover the human side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That definition of architecture (i.e. what Alan’s idea of an architect
does) dovetails pretty nicely with mine. The architect and architecture
is the link between the users (i.e. the business) and the software (i.e.
IT). The only thing I would change is that as we get deeper into service
orientation, interop and connected systems we have lots of process that
don’t have direct user involvement. So the “human goals” Alan mentions
may not be end user goals so much as business / organization goals.
Either way, they certainly aren’t IT goals.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dave_welsh/archive/2005/06/01/423984.aspx">Dave Welsh

and <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/">my dad</a> pointed out in my
<a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,26a8a400-285c-4810-aca7-3ba38a433a01.aspx">comments</a>,
Business is from Mars, IT is from Venus. But that doesn’t mean they
can’t get together. In fact, they have to get together. You show me a
system with no business drivers or impact and I’ll show you a failed
architecture.</p>
