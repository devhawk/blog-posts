Iron Link Poster Mike Gunderloy. As his <a href="http://afreshcup.com/2007/7/3/progress-report">.NET skills
deteriorate</a>, maybe I
can catch up…but I doubt it. I’m only <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/07/11/new-and-notable-177.aspx">77

<li>Last night was the Microsoft E3 Briefing. Gamerscore blog has the
<a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/07/10/NewsfromBriefing.aspx">news
rundown</a>.
Didn’t seem to be any HUGE news. Last year’s E3 was the first Halo 3
showing and X06 featured the Halo Wars announcement. Nothing that
earth-shaking this time, though the XBLM keeps on rolling, <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/07/10/DisneyStudios.aspx">now
featuring Disney
movies</a>.
(Major Nelson <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/07/11/disney-now-on-video-marketplace.aspx">has a
list</a>.)
I’m thinking that the whole HD-DVD vs. BluRay war is going to be
eclipsed by direct download before it’s over, though I’m still
waiting for PC support &amp; all-you-can-eat pricing.</li>
<li>Politics 2.0 Watch: Clay Shirky has a <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2007/07/09/andrew_keen_rescuing_luddite_from_the_luddites.php">great blog
post</a>
on modern-day Luddites. As he points out: “A Luddite argument is one
in which some broadly useful technology is opposed on the grounds
that it will discomfort the people who benefit from the inefficiency
the technology destroys.” How much inefficiency is there in our
modern political system? And more importantly, who benefits from
that inefficiency? We’ve already seen the dramatic effects blogs can
have on political news, media and reporting. What happens when
<del>users</del> citizens are no longer satisfied just writing about the
political process and want to get their hands dirty in the
policy-making process itself?</li>
