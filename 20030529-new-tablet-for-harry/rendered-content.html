<p>I got my new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/tabletpc/default.asp">Tablet
PC</a> today – the
<a href="http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/pc/pc_tabletPcDetail.jsp">Toshiba Portege
3500</a>.
Seems that’s the tablet of choice inside Microsoft. I like it because
it’s got 1GB of RAM and a nifty place to hold a full size pen. My
previous Tablet was a beta unit – I was a tablet champ so I had one 6
months before they launch. That was great before they were generally
available, but as it had only 256 MB of RAM, it’s not like I could use
it for coding. With a GB of RAM, I can run <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">write
code</a> in the host talking to a
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx">web/app
server</a> in a
virtual PC.</p>
