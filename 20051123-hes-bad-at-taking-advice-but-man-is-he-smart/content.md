He in this case is [Tim Mallalieu](https://blogs.msdn.com/timmall) from
the data programmability team. He and I used to work on the .NET
Adoption Team in the field together before we both moved to campus. Tim,
if I recall correctly, was the first outside hire we made on that team.
We used to constantly argue about who was the second smartest on the
team. He thought it was me and I thought it was him. We both agreed the
[Jeromy](http://blogs.msdn.com/jeromyc) was the smartest.

Anyway, after literally years of haranguing, Tim finally started a
[blog](https://blogs.msdn.com/timmall). But he’s still not really
listening to me. I told him he should start with a series of smaller
posts and he
[didn’t](https://blogs.msdn.com/timmall/archive/2005/11/23/496262.aspx). 

I’m back working with Tim in a fashion as both my team and his team try
and get a handle on how data is going to evolve as we move to service
orientation. Most of the existing data paradigms and semantics such as
table joins and transactions assume everything is together in one
database. Obviously, as we break down large systems into smaller
services, having everything in one database just isn’t practical.
