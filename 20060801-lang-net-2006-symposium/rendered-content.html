<p>Yesterday, I attended the <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/">Lang .NET 2006
Symposium</a> – basically a public
version of the CLR Compiler Lab I went to back in March. Unfortunately,
with my new job, I couldn’t attend all three days, but I did attend day
one. Here we’re my thoughts on the various sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Anders Hejlsberg – LINQ and C# 3.0</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This was basically a rehash of his talk from the March Compiler lab.
Makes sense as it was a new audience, but the “Query the Running
Processes” demo is getting pretty old. Check out <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/14/compiler-dev-lab-linq/">my notes from
March</a> for
more details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://sky.fit.qut.edu.au/%7Egough/">John Gough</a> – Dealing with Ruby on
the CLR</strong></p>
<p>John is a professor from the <a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/Default.aspx">Programming Languages and
Systems</a> group at <a href="http://www.qut.edu.au/">Queensland
University of Technology</a>. They’re the ones
building <a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/Ruby.NET/">Ruby.NET</a>. He’s also the
author of <a href="http://www.phptr.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0130622966">Compiling for the .NET Common Language
Runtime</a>, a
great if somewhat dated (i.e. .NET 1.0) book.</p>
<p>Much of John’s talk covered the ground that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/default.aspx">Jim
Hugunin</a> covered <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/15/compiler-dev-lab-scripting/">back in
March</a>
around the difficulties of mapping dynamic languages to the static CLR.
For example, most Ruby.NET objects are instances of Ruby.Object, with
their link to a class – a Ruby.Class – managed by the Ruby.NET runtime
rather than leveraging the CLR’s built-in class structure.</p>
<p>He didn’t spend much time talking about the really hard problems like
continuations, which I was really hoping he would.</p>
<p>There are a series of “allied” tools coming out of this project which
look really interesting in their own right:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/perwapi/">PE File Reader/Writer</a> – a
managed component for reading writing DLL and EXE files.</li>
<li><a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/gppg/">Gardens Point Parser Generator</a>
(GPPG) – a Yacc/<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">Bison</a> style
parser generator, written in and generating C#</li>
<li>Gardens Point LEX (GPLEX) – companion to GPPG for generating C#
scanners, a la LEX or <a href="http://flex.sourceforge.net/">Flex</a>. Not
released yet, but John indicated it would be available in the next
couple of weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cdiggins.com/">Christopher Diggins</a> – <a href="http://www.cdiggins.com/cat">Cat Programming
Language</a>: A Functional Optimization
Framework for the CLI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m fairly sure Christopher doesn’t present often. Otherwise he
would have know that there’s no way to present <a href="http://www.cdiggins.com/cat/cat_lang_net.ppt">107
slides</a> in 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Christopher had a hard time expressing why someone would use Cat,
even when asked point blank by an audience member. Most of his 107
slides were describing various features of the language. I don’t
know about the rest of the audience, but I got lost pretty quickly.</li>
<li>It’s too bad Christopher was so obtuse as a speaker, as Cat seemed
pretty interesting. If you skip the first 78 slides (!) of his deck,
you get to a slide named “Transformation Engine” which seems to be
the primary reason for Cat’s existence. The idea seems to be to
build a large number (Chris said potentially thousands) of little
optimization transformations which are used to “prune” the tree
during the binary generation stage of a compiler.</li>
<li>The only problem with this (other than the difficulty of following
the presentation) is that I don’t think compiler optimization is a
particularly useful area of study. I subscribe to “<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/%7Etoddpro/papers/law.htm">Proebsting’s
Law</a>” on this
one: “Advances in compiler optimizations double computing power
every 18 <em>years</em>.” This implies that programmer productivity is far
more important than compiler optimization. Ruby is the latest great
example of this phenomenon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mark Cooper – <a href="http://pagexml.net/">Page XML</a> : An XML based domain
specific language for developing web applications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page XML is a DSL for building web apps. Unfortunately, it isn’t
released yet and it was hard to get a sense of what a solution built
with Page XML would look like from the individual features described
on slides. But I was certainly intrigued.</li>
<li>As a DSL, Page XML needs to encode domain-specific abstraction. One
example they provided that I thought was cool was their URL
handling. Good URL design is an important usability feature. URLs in
PageXML are split into constant and variable parts, so in a URL like
mysite.com/news/somechannel/4, the “somechannel” and the “4″ would
be variable parts that would map into parameters that are passed to
a page handler. Very cool.</li>
<li>There were a large number of what felt like small and simple yet
eminently usable features. Too many for me to write down.</li>
<li>The only think I didn’t like is the use of XML. No only are domain
specific concepts like URLs encoded in XML, but also relatively
mundane things like loops and if statements. This gets ugly really
quickly. I imagine, the creators of Page XML did this so they
wouldn’t have to build their own parser, but it really hurts the
usability of the language.</li>
<li>The last point really points to the need for a simple meta-language
– a language for building languages. Lex/Yacc and their derivatives
just don’t cut it. <a href="http://jayfields.blogspot.com/2006/05/executing-internal-dsl-in-multiple.html">Ruby is
good</a>
for building <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html#InternalDsl">internal
DSLs</a>,
but I’d like something faster and amenable to static typing as well
as something more light weight for building <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html#ExternalDsl">external
DSLs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This post is long enough and I have “real” work to do (the downside of
leaving evangelism!
😄 ).
I’ll post about the afternoon sessions later.</p>
