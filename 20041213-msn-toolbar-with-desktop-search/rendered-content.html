<p>The new MSN Toolbar is <a href="http://beta.toolbar.msn.com/">now publicly available in
beta</a>. The big new feature is the
integrated desktop search. I’ve been running internal builds for a
while, and I love it. Obviously, comparisons will be drawn to Google
Desktop but I can’t comment because Google Desktop wouldn’t run on my
machine because I have the Microsoft ISA Server client (according to the
<a href="http://desktop.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=10742">Google Desktop Help
Center</a>,
the latest version of the ISA client should work, but that’s what I was
running). However, from looking at the <a href="http://desktop.google.com/screenshots.html">Google Desktop screen
shots</a>, I know that Google
doesn’t have my favorite feature of the MSN Toolbar – the
<a href="http://beta.search.msn.com/docs/toolbar.aspx?t=MSNTbar_CONC_AboutDeskbar.htm">Deskbar</a>.
It’s available via keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-Alt-M) and supports program
execution (type “=appname” to launch appname) as well as <a href="http://beta.search.msn.com/docs/toolbar.aspx?t=MSNTBar_CONC_AboutDeskbarShortcuts.htm&amp;v=02.00.00">typing
shortcuts</a>.
I also like the search results page as I can narrow where my search
executes in real time. For example, if I type “OOPSLA” into my deskbar
it auto executes the the search across all locations on my desktop. As
you would expect, the search screen is near-instant – just the time it
takes to draw the window. Then I can narrow down to just show results
from Documents, Email, Music, Pictures &amp; Video, Email Attachments,
Meetings, Contacts, etc. - in all around 19 different locations. I’m
also only one click away from searching the web, news or images online
from the search results screen.</p>
