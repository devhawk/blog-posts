<p>So Iâ€™ve already sold two of my <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/harrypierson*">new
t-shirts</a>. Not quite enough to
retire on, but itâ€™s a start!
ðŸ˜„</p>
<p>If nothing else, this has helped me realize just how popular Zazzle is.
As I type this, my shirts are on page 20 of Zazzleâ€™s <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/products/gallery/browse_results.asp?general_product_type=235">most recent shirt
list</a>.
Thatâ€™s 304 new shirt designs since yesterday. Thatâ€™s pretty impressive.</p>
