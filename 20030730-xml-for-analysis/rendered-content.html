<p>I haven’t seen an “official” announcement, but Microsoft released betas
of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=02ddcc80-604b-4343-9d42-4298e10a1a56">XML for Analysis
SDK</a>
and
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=49737737-681e-465e-83c5-51b7223b1585">ADOMD.NET</a>.
XML for Analysis (<a href="http://www.xmla.org/">XMLA</a>) is “an open
industry-standard web service interface designed specifically for online
analytical processing (OLAP) and data-mining functions”. The XMLA SDK
provides an XMLA compliant web service for SQL 2000 Analysis Services.
ADOMD.NET provides a .NET library for accessing XMLA compliant web
services.</p>
<p>I never have really gotten into Analysis Services, but I’ve wanted to.
It’s always been a time issue – I just can’t focus on everything!</p>
