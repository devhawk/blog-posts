Marc Canter seems pretty excited that Songbird is going to support XSPF.
While Marc has written about it many times, I had no idea what it was.
It’s the [XML Shareable Playlist Format](http://www.xspf.org/)
(pronounced “spiff”). It’s designed to be simple and open and built on
XML. Typically, that’s coolness but while reading the
[spec](http://www.xspf.org/xspf-v1.html), I had a strong sense of
deja-vu. XSPF defines a list of songs for a playlist, much the same way
that [RSS](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-2-0) defines a list of blog
entries.

So that begs the question, why didn’t XSPF just use RSS instead of
starting from scratch? RSS is simple, open, built on XML and is
massively popular? Remember when Adam Bosworth that [pointed
out](http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=337&page=4)
that RSS and Atom are “both support a base schema that provides a model
for sets”. I’m all for a simple, open and extensible playlist format,
but I’m not excited that XSPF has gone of an reinvented the concept of
“list” in order to do it.
