<p>Streaming producer presenations from TechEd US have been posted.
However, the streaming presenation site has the same
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/03/04/url-addressability/">lack-of-url-addressability</a>
issue that TechEd Breakout session list had. Is it so hard to just post
a simple HTML file with a list of all the sessions in a track? &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
<p>Anyway, here are links to the top 5 sessions from this yearâ€™s
architecture track. For those who could not make it to TechEd (or were
there, but missed these sessions) enjoy!</p>
<ol>
<li>Realizing SOA by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados">John deVadoss</a> &amp;
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/RJacobs/">Ron Jacobs</a></li>
<li>Data in SOA by Harry Pierson (i.e. yours truly)</li>
<li>Patterns in the Enterprise by <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings.html">Gregor
Hohpe</a></li>
<li>Improving Application Perf &amp; Scale by <a href="http://www.vergentsoftware.com/blogs/ckinsman/">Chris
Kinsman</a></li>
<li>Building Apps with P&amp;P App Blocks by Wojtek Kozaczynski</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The streaming site has been taken down, so none of the
links work anymore. Sorry about that. We will be updating the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series">Architecture Strategy Series</a>
at some point in the future with at least the Realizing SOA and Data in SOA talks.</p>
