<p>Great to hear someone’s already using <a href="prj_wiki.aspx">DevHawk Wiki</a>.
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/">Robert Hurlbut</a> (who’s working with
<a href="http://samgentile.com/blog/">Sam Gentile</a>) <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/posts/10521.aspx">set it
up</a> for his team’s
internal use. Great to hear it’s going well Robert!</p>
<p>I figure there are two primary areas where I am interested in outside
collaborative assistance on DevHawk Wiki. First, the WikiRenderer. I
imagine as people start using DevHawk Wiki, they are going to want more
formatting features. Second, SampleWiki is just that – a sample. A
“real” wiki would need to add support for versioning at a minimum. User
Authentication, search, multiple back ends (files, DB, etc), and reverse
links are some of the other features I’d like to see.</p>
<p>I’m not particularly interested in enhancing SampleWiki or building a
“RealWiki”. I built DevHawk Wiki primarily to have the WikiRenderer for
another project I’m working on (more on that later). So I <em>really</em> mean
it when I ask for
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/applyjoin.aspx?id=9513f6ed-41c2-4c0f-a5d6-730371bb4b45">collaborators</a>.</p>
