<p>I’m guessing someone blogged it last week (I gave up on catching up on
blogs since I was almost three weeks behind), but there’s now a <a href="http://www.altova.com/support_freexmlspyhome.asp">free
home edition</a> of
<a href="http://www.altova.com/products_ide.html">xmlspy</a>. Many of the cool
<a href="http://www.altova.com/matrix_x.html">features</a>, including the schema
editor, are available. However, the web services support, primarily the
<a href="http://www.altova.com/features_wsdl.html">WSDL editor</a>, remain only a
part of the enterprise edition.</p>
<p>I keep wondering if someone in the community will build a WSDL editor
with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/extend/">VSIP</a>, esp. one that
supports WSDL <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-wsdl-20010315">1.1</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-wsdl20-20040326">2.0</a>. I know CapeClear
has their <a href="http://www.capescience.com/soa/index.shtml">WSDL editor</a>, but
I find the explorer style view much less usable than the xmlspy-style
graphical view.</p>
