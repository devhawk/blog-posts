<p>Yesterday, was <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/">Microsoft’s big
reveal</a> for Xbox 360
this coming holiday season. If you’re not a gamer, please move along,
nothing to see here. Also note, I work @ Microsoft, but not in the games
division so this is only my thoughts on yesterday’s announcements.</p>
<ul>
<li>While several “hard-core” games were showcased – <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/fallout3/">Fallout
3</a>, Resident Evil 5, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/fable2/">Fable
2</a>, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/gearsofwar2/">Gears of War
2</a> and the surprise
announcement that Final Fantasy XIII – the rest of yesterday’s
briefing screamed “we’re not just for hard core gamers!”  Call it
the Wii effect. Even the title of the main E3 Press Release was
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/articles/0714-gamesall.htm">Gameplay for Every
Passion</a>.</li>
<li>Honestly, my favorite announcement from yesterday wasn’t game
related at all – it was the announcement of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/articles/0714-netflixteamup.htm">Netflix on Xbox
360</a>.
I’ve been <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/11/23/hawkeye-on-xbl-video-marketplace/">hoping for a flat rate subscription
plan</a>
since Video Marketplace first launched. Soon, I’ll have it.</li>
<li>I’m not sure what I think of the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/NR/rdonlyres/BE004694-EDED-4077-BD82-6AD23014821F/0/vidNXEe30801LLHi.asx">New Xbox
Experience</a>
yet. On the one hand, the whole cartoon avatar thing isn’t really my
bag. Plus, isn’t it quite the Mii clone? However, the ability to
share photo and video viewing experiences – even with cartoony
avatars – and the flashy + engaging navigation mechanism looks like
a real improvement. Here’s hoping they improve the performance of
navigating hard drive content (games library, gamer pictures, etc).</li>
<li>Congrats to my friend Matt who’s been very involved in the
development of the new Primetime game show channel. I’m not that
interested in “1 vs 100″, but I think the potential of that game
model is pretty huge. If they created a Jeopardy game for Primetime,
I think my parents would by a 360 right away.</li>
<li>Music / party games seem to have been the primary focus of the press
briefing. I’m definitely getting <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/rockband2/">Rock Band
2</a> (AC/DC woot!) and I think
my wife would like <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/lips/">Lips</a> (she
usually sings when we play Rock Band). I want to see how the
“wireless interactive microphones: Featuring stylish interactive
motion sensors and lights” will work. Guitar Hero World Tour looks
cool too, but I’m not re-buying all new music hardware.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/yitm/">You’re in the Movies</a> looks like a
hoot, plus it doesn’t really look like a game, so much as a “party
activity”. For example, while there are minigame winners or losers,
“winning” takes a back seat to the final movie result. I’m guessing
this will be big with the kids.</li>
<li>Speaking of kids, Patrick is really looking forward to
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bknutsandbolts/">Banjo-Kazooie Nuts &amp;
Bolts</a>. He loves anything
related to building, and building fantastic vehicles is a core part
of the gameplay. As for Riley, I think she’s getting old enough to
enjoy Viva Pinata – she enjoys watching Patrick and I play – though
I’m not sure we need the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/vptip/">new Viva
Pinata</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/geowarsre2xboxlivearcade/">Geometry Wars
2</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/portalxboxlivearcade/">Portal:
Still Alive</a>, both
coming to Xbox Live Arcade. ’nuff said.</li>
<li>Not really “new” news, but <a href="http://catalog.xna.com/gamescatalog.aspx">XNA Community
Games</a> launches this fall.
I’ve got a creators club membership, so I’m able to experiment with
this now – it rocks, though the available games are pretty shall I
say “unpolished” at this point.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/halowars/">Halo Wars</a> not coming until     2009. 😦</li>
<li>No new Bungie news, but their
<a href="http://www.bungie.net/defaultsi.aspx">website</a> is counting down
to <em>something</em> tomorrow. I guess we’ll find out then.</li>
</ul>
