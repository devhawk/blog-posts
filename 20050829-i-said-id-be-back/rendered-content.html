<p>So my time off ended a month ago, but I haven’t blogged significantly in
over two months. New kid + new job + new house will do that to you.
However, I spent the time this morning upgrading DevHawk to the new 1.8
version of
<a href="http://wiki.shahine.com/default.aspx/DasBlog/homepage.html">dasBlog</a>
and I’m ready to jump back in.</p>
<p>Back when I was still on leave, my new boss <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John
deVadoss</a> this to say about my new job:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our current thinking is that Harry will focus on two top-level areas</p>
<ol>
<li>Being the storyteller (Metropolis, Connected Systems etc)</li>
<li>Changing the way we evangelize Architecture – its not all about
n-dimensional frameworks, with m layers of abstraction, about
perspectives and viewpoints, with n-layers of capability mappings,
and enterprise frameworks up and down the wazooo, blah blah blah.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I loved #2. Architecture is such different things to different people
(more on that later) but I thought John’s description about what it’s
<em>not</em> all about was priceless.</p>
