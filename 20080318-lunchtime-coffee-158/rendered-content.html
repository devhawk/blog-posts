<li>My friend (and hopefully my next representative) <a href="http://www.darcyburner.com/">Darcy
Burner</a> is leading a group of
congressional challengers in publishing <a href="http://www.responsibleplan.com/plan">A Responsible Plan To End
The War In Iraq</a>. I haven’t
read the plan itself in detail, but I sure like what I’m hearing
about it.</li>
<li>Speaking of politics, Obama’s speech today “<a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/samgrahamfelsen/gGBbJv">A More Perfect
Union</a>”
was fantastic.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bioshock/">Bioshock</a> is <a href="http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/15924/BioShock-Sequel-Announced-Coming-Next-Year/">getting a
sequel</a>.
’nuff said.</li>
<li>There’s a <a href="https://www.foldershare.com/clientdownload.aspx">new
version</a> of
<a href="http://foldershareteam.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!9D186A323DE6761!133.entry">FolderShare
out</a>
and I’ve got mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, I’ve been a
regular user of FolderShare for a while so it’s nice to see it get a
face lift. On the other hand, it’s been over two years since
Microsoft bought FolderShare and we’re only just now getting a new
version, which is literally nothing more that a face lift – this
version introduces no new functionality at all.</li>
<li>I was hoping to geek out vicariously via someone else’s hacking
around with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/singularity/">Singularity</a>.
Luckily, Matthew Podwysocki
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/03/11/singularity-c-os-released-on-codeplex.aspx">provides</a>
just such an opportunity.</li>
<li>Looks like “<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/prism">Prism</a>” is the new CAB.
Glenn Block has two extensive posts covering a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2008/03/12/prism-launches-on-codeplex.aspx">project
overview</a>
and their <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2008/03/12/prism-ri-first-drop.aspx">first
drop</a>.
I think it’s interesting that the Prism team is focused on building
a reference implementation, and letting the framework eventually
fall out. Reading thru the description, it sounds awesome. However,
based on the massive increase of inbox throughput I’m experiencing
since I <em>accepted</em> the new job, I can’t imagine I’ll have time to
play with it. Maybe Matthew will start playing with Prism too! (via

<li>Speaking of Sam, he points to a series by Bob Beauchemin entitled
<a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/bobb/2008/02/14/MHOLINQToSQLAndEntityFrameworkPanaceaOrEvilIncarnatePart1.aspx">LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework: Panacea or evil
incarnate?</a>
With a title like that, who can resist reading the whole series?
Err, I can because LINQ 2 SQL &amp; EF performance just fell off my
radar entirely. However I gotta agree with Sam’s point that he
“can’t think of anyone more qualified than Bob” to tackle these
questions.</li>
<li>Tomas Restrepo blogs his <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2008/03/13/DevEnvironmentForPowerShell.aspx">dev environment PS
script</a>
as well as a <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2008/03/17/PowerShellFortune.aspx">PS fortune
script</a>.
Personally, I use Chris Tavares’ <a href="http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/post.aspx?id=0ccbfc67-fc1b-496b-b71e-a74301e583de">vsvars wrapper for
PS</a>,
though I’ll gladly take an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nandal/archive/2008/03/10/influence-the-future-of-windows-sdk-powershell-based-build-environment.aspx">“official” PS based dev
environment</a>.</li>
<li>I wonder if Ted Neward will get jumped for <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/03/15/Mort+Means+Productivity.aspx">admiring
Mort</a>
the way <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/19/not-crazy-just-lateral-thinking.aspx">Nick Malik
did</a>.
Given that Ted called himself Mort while Nick compared Mort to agile
developers, I’m guess Ted will have to go back to his <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx">Vietnam
analogy</a>
if he wants to create controversy.</li>
<li>Speaking of Ted, I agree <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/03/15/The+Reason+For+Conferences.aspx">with his
point</a>
that conferences are about people. As a python pre-newbie (I figure
I’ll reach full newbie status by the time I actually start my new
job), I spent most of my PyCon time connecting with people rather
than trying to learn technical stuff. Also, I love Ted’s WHISCEY
acronym.</li>
<li>Speaking of PyCon, my soon-to-be new teammate Srivatsn Narayanan
blogs <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/srivatsn/archive/2008/03/18/pycon-2008.aspx">his thoughts on
PyCon</a>.
I’ll try and get to my PyCon thoughts soon.</li>
