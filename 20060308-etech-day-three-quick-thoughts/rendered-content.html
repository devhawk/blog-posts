<p>After my marathon blogging session last night and taking notes all day,
I’m a bit burnt out on writing. But here are a few quick thoughts. More
details to follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m digging the <a href="http://www.live.com/">Live.com home page</a> and the
integrated Live Search. Since I’m on a rented laptop, <a href="http://toolbar.live.com/">Live
Toolbar</a> will have to wait. Coolest new
feature IMO is the <a href="http://microsoftgadgets.com/Macros">Search
Macros</a>, though it’s a tight
race with the new image search interface.</li>
<li>Jon Udell and Michael Goldhaber spoke about attention economy today.
I still don’t get it, though Jon had some interesting ideas about
metadata. I’ll believe that attention is a currency when I can buy a
car with it.</li>
<li>I liked the session on the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns">Yahoo! Design
Patterns</a>, though the title
and abstract of the session were awful. The title was “<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8602">The Language
of Attention: A Pattern
Approach</a>“.
The inclusion of attention just confused the issue. Why couldn’t
they just call it “A Pattern Language for User Experience”? Because
it doesn’t have the concept of attention shoehorned into it.</li>
<li>I really like <a href="http://eventful.com/">Eventful</a>, even though I’m <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/13/web-2-0-evolution/">on
record</a> as
thinking their business model doesn’t work. Their new <a href="http://eventful.com/demand">demand
feature</a> is pretty cool, though it
doesn’t really help their business model any.</li>
<li>George Dyson’s session on “<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8035">Turing’s
Cathedral</a>”
was fascinating, though he tried to cover too much ground in the
time alloted.</li>
<li>I’m not sure what the point of Joel Spolsky’s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8323">Blue Chip Report
Card</a>
was. Apparently the alien from <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> is
cute and Motorola newer cell phones (RAZR and PEBL) are taking
Joel’s advice on becoming “blue chip”. This is somewhat related to
points the folks from Adobe (previously Macromedia) made, except
much more obtuse.</li>
<li>I have no idea what the point or business model of Plum is, even
though it was
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/9004">featured</a>
as a keynote (a last minute promotion it appears from the conference
guide). Seems too complex and centralized to actually work.</li>
<li>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/07/felipe-cabrera-on-amazons-mechanical-turk/">wrote last
night</a> that
Casting Words isn’t really a business because nothing stops me from
going directly to Mechanical Turk and getting the transcription
services myself. Today, I found a Casting Words task on Mechanical
Turk so I decided to figure out how much they’re making. The task I
found was to transcribe about 28 minute podcast and they were
offering $5.41 for anyone willing to do it. That’s about 19.5 cents
per minute. Tack on Amazon’s 10% charge brings the total to around
21.5 cents a minute that Casting Words is paying for transcription
services. Given that they’re charging 42 cents a minute, that’s just
under a 49% profit margin. Exactly what are they doing to earn that
profit? What’s their value add and is really worth a 100% markup?</li>
<li>Anyone want to start “Cheap Casting Words” with me? We’ll pay 22
cents a minute (11% more than Casting Words) and charge 36 cents a
minute (14% less than Casting Words) and keep the 12 cents a minute
markup (a 33% markup).
😄</li>

economy sessions from today.</p>
