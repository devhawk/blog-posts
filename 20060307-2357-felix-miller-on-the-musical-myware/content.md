Felix is from [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/), which I haven’t used.
However, I’m definitely going to give it a try after seeing Felix’s
talk. Last.fm is all about harnessing collective intelligence for music.
The basic idea is that you install a plugin to your music player and it
uploads everything you listen to the central server. Then they can do
analysis of the collective data to make associations and
recommendations. Sounds cool. Gotta try it out.

Felix was also making a more meta point which was where the name of the
talk came from. He’s talking about myware as a play on spyware. The idea
is to “spy” on yourself in an unobtrusive manner and then use that
collected information to help you sometime in the future – in this case
help you find new music by spying on your music playing habits. There’s
major privacy concerns of course, but the idea is pretty interesting.
Something to noodle on at any rate.
