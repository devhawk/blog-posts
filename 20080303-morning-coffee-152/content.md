-   I was slammed Friday, so I didn’t get a chance to post the results
    of last Thursday night’s hockey game. I’m sure you’ve all been eager
    to hear. We lost, bad, 8-2. Personally, I was -3 and had no points,
    but I played much better than last week. We had three full lines of
    forwards, which was a big help, but I have started to find my
    ice-legs so to speak.

    Everything](http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/02/28/link-to-everything-a-list-of-linq-providers.aspx).
    Of all of them, I found [LINQ over
    C\#](http://www.codeplex.com/LinqOverCSharp) fascinating, especially
    given my recent efforts in parsing.

    about a distributed source control system called
    [Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org/). Unlike most version control
    systems, Bazaar is distributed which means you can use it without a
    server. According to Chris, you can share branches as easily as
    mailing a file. I wonder if you could make Bazaar work over a [P2P
    network](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.peertopeer.aspx).
-   While looking up the MSDN link for the previous coffee item, I
    noticed an entire new section in the MSDN Library for [Open Protocol
    Specifications](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc203350.aspx).
    Not much to add, just wanted to highlight their existence.

    using the new version Expression Blend to build a Silverlight 2.0
    app. Personally, I was most interested in seeing [some of the new of
    built-in
    controls](http://silverlight2blogpost.s3.amazonaws.com/step6.png).
