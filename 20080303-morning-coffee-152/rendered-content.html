<li>I was slammed Friday, so I didn’t get a chance to post the results
of last Thursday night’s hockey game. I’m sure you’ve all been eager
to hear. We lost, bad, 8-2. Personally, I was -3 and had no points,
but I played much better than last week. We had three full lines of
forwards, which was a big help, but I have started to find my
ice-legs so to speak.</li>

Everything</a>.
Of all of them, I found <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/LinqOverCSharp">LINQ over
C#</a> fascinating, especially
given my recent efforts in parsing.</li>

about a distributed source control system called
<a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a>. Unlike most version control
systems, Bazaar is distributed which means you can use it without a
server. According to Chris, you can share branches as easily as
mailing a file. I wonder if you could make Bazaar work over a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.peertopeer.aspx">P2P
network</a>.</li>
<li>While looking up the MSDN link for the previous coffee item, I
noticed an entire new section in the MSDN Library for <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc203350.aspx">Open Protocol
Specifications</a>.
Not much to add, just wanted to highlight their existence.</li>

using the new version Expression Blend to build a Silverlight 2.0
app. Personally, I was most interested in seeing <a href="http://silverlight2blogpost.s3.amazonaws.com/step6.png">some of the new of
