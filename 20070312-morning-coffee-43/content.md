-   This week is the MVP summit. Hopefully, I’ll make it over there and
    see the Architect MVPs. Otherwise, things seem sort of quiet in the
    Microsoft wing of the blogoshphere.
-   Saw 300 yesterday on a relatively rare day out with just Jules.
    Really enjoyed it.

    [recaps](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=829) a vendor
    SOA suites podcast. With SOA, you can revisit your platform decision
    on a project by project basis which allows you to avoid the dreaded
    “vendor lock-in”. But supporting lots of platforms is an operational
    nightmare, so maybe lock-in isn’t as bad as it sounds.
