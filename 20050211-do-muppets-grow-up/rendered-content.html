<p>This is way off topic, but did you ever notice that the characters on
Sesame Street that date back to the 70′s – Big Bird, Grover, Oscar the
Grouch, Cookie Monster, The Count, etc. – are all adults while the more
recent additions like Elmo, Rosita, Zoe and Baby Bear are all kids. I’m
not sure what it means, but it made me think: Did the makers of the show
decide they needed characters that kids could identify with better? Or
did the original characters somehow grow up? That’s a sorta wacky
thought.</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering, Patrick watches Sesame Steet every morning and
I have to sit in with him to make sure he doesn’t climb out of his high
chair.</p>
