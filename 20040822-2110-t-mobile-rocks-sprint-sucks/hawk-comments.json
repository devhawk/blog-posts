    "content": "Its a shame the wireless companies each seem to have a major flaw.  I switched from AT&T (after 10 years) to Nextel 'cause my new job issued me one.  What a mistake - the radio service severely sucks, and I get dropped calls on the cell all the time.  I saw a Gartner \"magic quadrant\" on the cell carriers about a year ago and it was surprising how mediocre to crappy they all were in at least one major dimension.  The trouble is - they all seem to be crappy at something different!"
