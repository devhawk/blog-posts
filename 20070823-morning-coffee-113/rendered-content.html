<li>I’m in Chicago today and tomorrow for a reunion of sorts. In my last
job, I managed a group of external architects called the Microsoft
Architecture Advisory Board (aka the MAAB). We discontinued the
program a while back, but the core of the group found the program
valuable enough they have continued to meet anyway. I found the MAAB
meetings incredibly valuable and insightful, so I’m really excited
to be invited to continue my involvement with the group.</li>
<li>I picked up Bioshock Tuesday (Circuit City <a href="http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2007/08/19/get-bioshock-and-all-pro-football-for-the-cheap/">had it on
sale</a>)
on my way to my bi-weekly campus excursion. My meetings were over
around 2pm so I headed home early, expecting to surprise the kids.
But Jules had decided to skip naps and go shopping with them. Her
cell phone was dead, so I ended up at home with a couple of hours to
myself and a brand new copy of Bioshock. Wow, is that a good game.
Certainly deserving of the <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/bioshock">amazingly good
reviews</a>
it’s garnered.</li>
<li>Speaking of reviews, <a href="http://www.sonydefenseforce.com/?p=83">this transparently biased review of
Bioshock</a> over at Sony
Defense <del>Farce</del> Force is frakking hilarious. Somehow, I doubt
their dubious review will stem the tidal wave of Bioshock’s
well-deserved hype. Can’t wait to read their Halo 3 review.</li>
<li>Pat Helland <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/08/19/thoughts-about-multi-master-replication-of-tree-structured-data.aspx">writes at
length</a>
on master-master replication. I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/08/20/easier-to-read-version-of-my-last-post.aspx">reformated it into
PDF</a>
so I could read it – the large images were messing up the text flow
on my system. As usual for Pat, there’s gold in that thar post. His
thoughts on DAGs of versions and vector clocks as identifiers are
very exciting. However, I think he glosses over the importance of
declarative merging. I would think programmatic merge would likely
be non-deterministic across nodes. If so, wouldn’t you end up with
two documents with the same vector-clock identifier by different
data?</li>
<li>Joe McKendrick <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=939">points
to</a> a few people who
predict the term “service-oriented” will eventually be subsumed
under the general heading of “architecture”. Not to brag, but I made
that exact same prediction <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2004/12/17/323889.aspx">almost three years
ago</a>.</li>
<li>Erik Johnson
<a href="http://appside.blogspot.com/2005/08/patterns-for-soa-20.html">thinks</a>
that SOA 2.0 centers on transformational patterns. The idea (I
think) is that if systems “understand each other more deeply”, then
we can build a “smarter stack” and design apps via new constructs to
promote agility and simplicity. Personally, I’m skeptical that we
can define unambiguously system semantics except in the simplest
scenarios, but Erik talks about using “graph transformation
mathematics” to encode semantics. I don’t know anything about graph
transformation mathematics, but at least Erik has progressed beyond
hand waving to describing the “what”. Here’s looking forward to the
“how”.</li>

Clemens Vasters somehow <a href="http://vasters.com/clemensv/PermaLink,guid,9677a491-9037-4b79-baa3-bcf093737957.aspx">finds time to
implement</a>
an XML-RPC binding for WCF 3.5. I was encouraged that it didn’t
require any custom attributes or extensions at the programmer level.
Of course, XML-RPC fits semantically into WCF’s interface based
service model, so it shouldn’t be a huge surprise that it didn’t
require any custom extensions. But did it need WCF 3.5? Would this
work if recompiled against the 3.0 assemblies?</li>
<li>Phil Haack <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2007/08/19/why-duck-typing-matters-to-c-developers.aspx">writes a long
post</a>
on Duck Typing. VB9 <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/8/6/5868081c-68aa-40de-9a45-a3803d8134b8/Visual_Basic_9.0_Overview.doc">originally
supported</a>
duck typing – the feature was called Dynamic Interfaces – when it
was first announced, but it was <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbteam/archive/2007/01/11/extension-methods-part-2.aspx#1458124">subsequently
cut</a>.
I was really looking forward to that feature. Between it and XML
Literals, VB9 was really stepping out of C#’s shadow. I guess <a href="http://steve.emxsoftware.com/LINQ/XLinq+has+me+wanting+to+code+in+VBNET">it
still
is</a>,
even without dynamic interfaces.</li>
<li>Since I’ve been doing some LINQ to XML work lately, I decided to go
back and re-write my code in VB9 using XML literals. While XML
literals are nice, I don’t think they’re a must have. First, LINQ to
XML has a nice fluent interface, so the literals don’t give you that
much cleaner code (though you do avoid writing XElement and
XAttribute over and over.) Second, I find VB9′s template syntax
(like ASP &lt;%= expression %&gt;) clunky to work with, especially in
nested templates. Finally, I like the namespace support of XNames
better. As far as I can tell, VB9 defines namespaces with xmlns
attributes just like XML does. So I’m not dying for literal XML
support in a future version of C#. How about you?</li>
