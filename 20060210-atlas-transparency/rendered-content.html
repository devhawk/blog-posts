<p>I went to a brownbag today on <a href="http://atlas.asp.net/">Atlas</a>, though
since it was at 10am there was no one eating lunch or any brownbags to
be seen. As cool as the Atlas project is, the coolest thing is that when
I asked where their internal web site was,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jhawk/default.aspx">Johnathan</a> said they didn’t
have one – just the public <a href="http://atlas.asp.net/">http://atlas.asp.net/</a> site. How about that
for transparency! More of that, please!</p>
