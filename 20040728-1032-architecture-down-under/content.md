I’m off for New Zealand today. I’m presenting at [TechEd New
Zealand](http://www.microsoft.com/nz/teched) and [TechEd
Australia](http://www.microsoft.com/australia/teched/) next week.
They’ve got it set up nice – present in Auckland Friday and Monday, fly
to Australia Tuesday, then present in Canberra Wenesday and Thursday.
I’m presenting Metropolis and Data in SOA – the same talks I did at
TechEd US. After that, I’m off for a week in Sydney with family. Jules
& Patrick are coming with, and my mom is meeting up with us in
Australia. So things may be pretty slow around here, especially that
second week.

In prepration for this trip, I cleaned out my inbox for the first time
in, well, ever. Granted, most of it was simply moved to local archive
folders, but I did actually throw out everything in my deleted items
folders. Typcially, I run bouncing up against my 200 MB mailbox quota.
As of yesterday afternoon, I was at 26 MB. I haven’t had my inbox that
empty in five years. Of course, two weeks of unread and unanswered email
will fill that up real quick.
