I sent my wife a link to Joshua’s [entry on

Julie’s a teacher so I thought she’d find the following interesting:

> institutions, but the majority of advanced science and math degrees
> are awarded to foreign nationals.  Obviously, not everyone needs to be

> ultimately that benefits *everyone*.

of her on experience of earning success vs. entitlement.

 I wish she’d come work for Microsoft’s learning business unit.
