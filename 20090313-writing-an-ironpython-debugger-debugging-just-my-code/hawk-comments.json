    "content": "Very nice!  I'm looking forward to when you get to being able to set a breakpoint and view locals.  I played with Mdbg a while back and even was able to get it working in an IP project...but using the 'higher level' interface, not CorDebug.  This looks like it will be much faster/better.  I look forward to your updates.\n\nRegards,\n\nDavid L."

Probably very ugly...but who cares for now.  Now I need to allow for breakpoint deletion...\n\nOh it's killing the formatting in my message!  Too bad.  Thanks for a fun little project!\n\nDavid"
