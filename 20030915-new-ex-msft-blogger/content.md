My old teammate Rick Culpepper has [started a
blog](http://rickculpepper.net/). He wanted to use my code for his site,
but it’s such a complete mess at this point that he wisely chose to go
the [.Text](http://scottwater.com/DotText) route instead. He may not
*think* he’s got anything interesting to blog about, but he’s one of the
more interesting guys I know. Interesting enough that I wish he was
still a borg and a teammate. Subscribed.
