<p>My wife was poking around on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and
found two videos she wanted to show me. The first was a music video from
a band called <a href="http://okgo.net">okgo</a> where they <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv5zWaTEVkI">dance on
treadmills</a>. Interesting for
about 60 seconds. Unfortunately, the video is three minutes long. Still,
it is currently #8 on YouTube’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/browse?s=mp&amp;t=a">Most Watched All
Time</a> list. The other was a much
funnier video called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmsOIjzQ1V8">Stick Magnetic Ribbons on Your
SUV</a> (sung to the tune of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_ribbon">Tie a Yellow Ribbon ‘Round the Old Oak
Tree</a>). The song is by the
<a href="http://www.asylumstreetspankers.com/">Asylum Street Spankers</a> and the
video was produced by <a href="http://devilsnight.com">Devil’s Night
Productions</a>.</p>
<p>Among Devil’s Night’s other work is an almost unknown movie called
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480557/">Matters of Consequence</a> that
stared <a href="http://www.myspace.com/morty">Morty Coyle</a>. Morty fronts a band
called <a href="http://www.alldaysucker.net/">All Day Sucker</a>, which was born
out of the ashes of a band called THE iMPOSTERS. Back when I lived in
LA, I used to go see THE iMPOSTERS pretty much whenever they played.
This must have been the second half of 1996, when I was dealing with a
massively broken heart. They had a regular gig every week, though I
forget the name of the place. But I was there, pretty much every week. I
used to carry Morty around the club on my shoulders during the harmonica
solo of Rational Anthem. Wow, was that really 10 years ago?</p>
<p>Anyway, you check out a few songs from of All Day Sucker on their
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/alldaysuckermyspace">MySpace page</a>. Some of the
songs – Heavy Weather and Rub It In – date back to the iMPOSTERS days.
Their album is available from <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/alldaysucker">CD
Baby</a> and from
<a href="http://zune.net">Zune</a>,

<p>It’s amazing how small the world seems when you run across old friends
online like this. Especially when the recent wind storm and power outage
two weeks ago served as such a rude reminder of just how big the world
really is, regardless of how it seems.</p>
