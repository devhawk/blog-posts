    "content": "I think that we FPers commonly introduce our friends to the wrong way. Normally people learn new technologies because they somehow give you more power. I think that eliminating side-effects is only half of the story; and it's the part that feels limiting to non-FP programmers. It's actually not limiting but appreciating that is difficult without working in FP for a while. The powerful part of FP (the other half of the story) is using functions as first-class citizens - composing complex things out of simple already built and working composable pieces. I think it's a lot easier for non-FP programmers to grasp the power of higher order functions first, then later come to realize the value of side-effect-free programming. They see that it gets in the way of the power of composition. But they can't see that until they see the power of composition to begin with."
