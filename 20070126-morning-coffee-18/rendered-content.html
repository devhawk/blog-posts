<li>I’m sure glad <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes">Heroes</a> is back. And so
far, I’m liking this season of <a href="http://www.fox.com/24">24</a> better
than the last couple. I especially like how they’re introducing
Jack’s family to the storyline – very cool.</li>
<li>Bill Gates <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/301067_msfthype25.html">will be
on</a><a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml">The
Daily Show with Jon
Stewart</a>
next Monday. I rarely miss an episode (though I typically watch it a
day or two later via my DVR) so I’m looking forward to this.</li>
<li>Roger Sessions latest <a href="http://www.objectwatch.com/newsletters/ObjectWatchNewsletter054.pdf">ObjectWatch
newsletter</a>
is available. Roger does his usual brand of relating architectural
concepts to everyday situations (this time, planning his daughter’s
wedding). This one was funnier than most – especially since I have a
1 year old daughter – though I’m still waiting for one of these that
doesn’t contain the words “doppio machiato”. If you’re reading this
Roger, don’t worry, I <em>am</em> enjoying every moment.</li>
<li>Apparently, I am the keeper of obscure development knowledge on my
team. My teammate Buzz was getting an error in shdocvw.dll when
trying to open an XSD with the BizTalk editor. He’s on an interim
build of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-06EtEBusinessProcessPR.mspx">BTS06
R2</a>,
so bugs are to be expected, but he wasn’t sure what shdocvw was, so
he asked me. In case you’re curious, shdocvw is the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa752040.aspx">WebBrowser
control</a>.</li>
<li>Did I mention that I left my laptop power cord at the office <em>again</em>
on Tuesday? That’s three times in four the last five trips to my
office (not counting weekends, sick days and training). My boss
actually got a spare from <em>his</em> boss that I can leave at the house
24/7.</li>
