Those talks aren't lost forever, but the videos I have of them are each 7gb and I don't have the anything nearly powerful enough to compress them in a reasonable amount of time (need to get them down to approx 100mb). Expression Media decidied not to open them last time =)\n\nIf anyone wants to step up and help out, by all means let me know, but if not they will stay on this external hard-drive forever."
