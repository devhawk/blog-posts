<p>A couple of weeks ago, Paul Murphy pointed me at a <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/12/10/ssb-wrapper-class/">SSB Wrapper
Class</a>
that’s included in one of the SQL 2005 Beta 2 sample apps. That prompted
an email from the SSB dev lead with a much better SSB library that they
had written. You can get that

along with
<a href="http://www.sqlservicebroker.com/forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=33">two</a>
<a href="http://www.sqlservicebroker.com/forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=32">new</a>
samples that use it, up on the <a href="http://www.sqlservicebroker.com/forums">SQL Server Service Broker Developers
Spot</a>. The SSB Dev Spot is a
community site dedicated to apps written on top of SSB. It’s run by <a href="http://www.develop.com/us/technology/bio.aspx?id=66">Dan
Sullivan</a> of
Developmentor, who is also hosting <a href="http://www.sqlservicebroker.com/forums/default.aspx?ForumGroupID=7">his new
blog</a>
on the site. I hear Dan and fellow DM-ers <a href="http://staff.develop.com/bobb/weblog/default.aspx">Bob
Beauchemin</a> and
<a href="http://www.develop.com/us/technology/bio.aspx?id=67">Niels Berglund</a>
are all very excited about SSB. Nice to know I’m not the only one.</p>
