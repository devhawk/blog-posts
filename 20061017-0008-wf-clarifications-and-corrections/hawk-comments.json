Even though the WF/ASMX integration doesn't use asp.net \"sessions\" (i am fairly certain earlier betas did) it uses a \"session\" cookie - which means if the client goes away - so does the cookie.  \n\nThe OOB persistence service does load all \"running\" workflows - just not idled workflows.  I assume I mispoke when I mentioned that feature.",
