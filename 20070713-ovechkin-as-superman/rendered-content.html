Matrix award from the Information and Display and Entertainment
Association (IDEA): Best Music Video, Best Overall Video Display

<p><a href="http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&amp;page=TeamSchedule&amp;team=WSH&amp;season=20072008">Next
season</a>
is only a little under three months away. Given the <a href="http://tsn.ca/nhl/teams/news_story/?ID=213270&amp;hubname=nhl-capitals">moves the Caps have
made</a>
this off season, next season should be a sight better than last season.
Playoffs? Maybe. Contending for playoffs? Probably? Cup Contenders?
Check back in a couple more years!</p>
