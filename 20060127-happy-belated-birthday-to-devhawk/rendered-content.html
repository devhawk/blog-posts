<p>I was just talking to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/about-michael-arrington/">Michael
Arrington</a> about
some Web 2.0 stuff when I realized I’ve been blogging for <a href="http://devhawk.net/default,date,2003-01-14.aspx" title="three years now">three years
now</a>.
I started blogging three years and two weeks ago. Doesn’t seem that long
ago I was sitting in a Phoenix hotel room putting the finishing touches
on the blog engine that powered the first version of DevHawk. (I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/10/05/back-in-blog/">moved
over</a> to
<a href="http://www.dasblog.info/" title="DasBlog">DasBlog</a> just under a year later.)
But in reality, there’s been two kids, a new house, four roles, five
managers and a move to campus since I launched my DevHawk Blog. Quite a
ride!</p>
