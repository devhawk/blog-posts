<p>And then there is Julie, Harry’s wife. Every now and then I go over to
their place for an incredible dinner. She is a fantastic cook, and I
am sure I could maintain a decent weight if I eat reasonable portions,
but its <em>sooooo</em> good, I can’t just have one portion. They keep saying
I can come over more often, but thankfully I am in Bellevue, and they
are up by the future MS campus in Issaquah. This means that, although
the drive is only 10-20 minutes, I have to actively make an effort to
go. But when I do go, it is often the highlight of the week. [<a href="http://technovangelist.com/">Matt

<p>Thanks Matt! As you can imagine, I share Matt’s one portion dilemma. The
worst is chicken enchiladas – my wife’s chicken enchiladas are like
crack. I look my empty plate and think “I could eat one more” even
though I’ve polished off six already.</p>
<p>I also share his resolution to lose weight. Julie does too, but since
she’s 8 months pregnant, losing weight now would be a bad thing.
