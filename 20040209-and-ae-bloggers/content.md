At least [one
person](http://devhawk.net/CommentView.aspx?guid=94fd77ca-75d5-487c-a759-8eb3efbc75fe)
was interested in an OPML of MSFT .NEAT and AE bloggers. So I hacked
them out of my full blog roll and [posted
it](http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx) on my site. I will be keeping it
up to date, so check back every once in a while. I added a link to it in
my nav bar so it is always available.

I love dasBlog. I was able to make one small change to the web.config
file and now the OPML file is addressable while still being easily
managed via dasBlogâ€™s blogroll editor. Sweet.
