<li>Big news for IronRuby out of OSCON.
<a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/07/ironruby-at-oscon.html">John</a> and
<a href="http://blog.jredville.com/2008/07/24/ironruby-gives-back-to-rubyspec/">Jim</a>
have the details. Congrats to the IronRuby folks on reaching these
milestones and paving the way for others (i.e. IPy) to follow some
of the same paths.</li>
<li>One of those OSCON announcements, is a project my teammate Jimmy
Schementi has been working on:
<a href="http://schementi.com/silverline">Silverline</a>, which “<a href="http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/2008/07/browser-meet-ruby-on-rails.html">let’s you
write Rails code that can run on the
client</a>“.</li>
<li>Shri Borde – the dev manager for IPy, IRuby and F# – <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shrib/archive/2008/07/24/cls-compilation-of-ironpython.aspx">tackles a
tricky
subject</a>
of static compilation of dynamic Python code. This came up on the
mailing list recently as one of the outstanding requests for IPy to
do is support custom attributes, which requires static compilation.
Shri lays out some of the big issues with this approach. However,
the community has been fairly clear on this, so it’s obviously
something we need to look at.</li>
<li>I met someone from MS Research at the MS Product Fair who pointed me
to the Institute for <a href="http://www.roboteducation.org/">Personal Robots in
Education</a>, a joint effort between
<a href="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a> and <a href="http://www.brynmawr.edu/">Bryn Mawr
College</a> and sponsored by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft
Research</a>. Their <a href="http://wiki.roboteducation.org/Myro">Myro
software</a> (myro == my robot) is
written in CPython, but there’s an effort underway (aka <a href="http://wiki.roboteducation.org/Myro_3.0">Miro
3.0</a>) to build a .NET
version that uses IronPython. Must investigate.</li>

how easy it is to extend C# types in IronPython. It’s also shows
how simple it is to host DLR code in your app – it’s like 6 lines of
code!</li>

reviews</a>
of <a href="http://www.manning.com/foord/">IronPython in Action</a> are good.  </li>

<li>The XNA team has <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-us/XboxLIVECommunityGames">announced their business
plans</a> for
community games. Basically, you set a price point between 200 and
800 points (aka between $2.50 and $10) and receive a “baseline” of
70% of the revenue the game generates. More details are available in
the <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-us/XboxLIVECommunityGames">FAQ</a>.
This is pretty excited. I’d like to build some co-op kids games.</li>
<li>Speaking of XNA, Caligari is now offering <a href="http://www.caligari.com/Products/trueSpace/tS75/brochure/intro.asp?Cate=BIntro">TrueSpace
7.6</a>
for free . <a href="http://letskilldave.com/blog/truespace-7-6-is-available-for-free-and-why-you-should-care/">David
Weller</a>
and <a href="http://www.virtualrealm.com.au/blogs/caligari-truespace-7-6-released-for-free/">Glenn
Wilson</a>

<li>Congrats to the CodePlex team on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/codeplex/archive/2008/07/23/codeplex-project-discussions-mailing-lists.aspx">their latest
drop</a>,
which features that a cool new feature – <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Mailing%20Lists&amp;referringTitle=CodePlex%20Documentation">Mailing
Lists</a>!
IronPython has had a <a href="http://lists.ironpython.com/listinfo.cgi/users-ironpython.com">Mailman mailing
list</a>
for years, so I’m not sure we’ll use this feature on IPy, but I’ll
investigate it</li>
<li>Two PDC notes: First, Rick Rashid – VP of MS Research – will be
<a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/View.aspx?post=91d46819-8472-40ad-a661-2c78acb4018c:8763070">delivering a PDC
keynote</a>.
Second, the PDC team has put up a video podcast on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Dan/Countdown-To-PDC2008--Producing-a-Ginormous-Conference-in-10-Minutes-or-Less/">Producing a
Ginormous Conference in 10 Minutes or
Less!</a>
It’s the “inaugural episode” so watch for more Countdown to PDC
video podcast episodes in the future.</li>
<li>I recently discovered Chris Smith’s F# blog. He’s got recent posts
on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chrsmith/archive/2008/07/10/mastering-f-lists.aspx">Mastering F#

For the F# novice, check out his F# in 20 Minutes posts (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chrsmith/archive/2008/05/02/f-in-20-minutes-part-i.aspx">part

Good luck Pat!</li>
<li>I like Nick Malik’s formal definition of use cases, but I can’t help
be reminded of Charlie Alfred’s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480060.aspx">Value-Driven
Architecture</a>
article in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480034.aspx">Architecture Journal
5</a> where he
said use cases were “easy to teach and explain” but that “if
simplicity were the only goal that counted, we’d all still be
walking or riding horses to get from one place to another.”</li>
</ul>
