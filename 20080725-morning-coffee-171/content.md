-   Big news for IronRuby out of OSCON.
    [John](http://www.iunknown.com/2008/07/ironruby-at-oscon.html) and
    [Jim](http://blog.jredville.com/2008/07/24/ironruby-gives-back-to-rubyspec/)
    have the details. Congrats to the IronRuby folks on reaching these
    milestones and paving the way for others (i.e. IPy) to follow some
    of the same paths.
-   One of those OSCON announcements, is a project my teammate Jimmy
    Schementi has been working on:
    [Silverline](http://schementi.com/silverline), which “[let’s you
    write Rails code that can run on the
    client](http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/2008/07/browser-meet-ruby-on-rails.html)“.
-   Shri Borde – the dev manager for IPy, IRuby and F\# – [tackles a
    tricky
    subject](http://blogs.msdn.com/shrib/archive/2008/07/24/cls-compilation-of-ironpython.aspx)
    of static compilation of dynamic Python code. This came up on the
    mailing list recently as one of the outstanding requests for IPy to
    do is support custom attributes, which requires static compilation.
    Shri lays out some of the big issues with this approach. However,
    the community has been fairly clear on this, so it’s obviously
    something we need to look at.
-   I met someone from MS Research at the MS Product Fair who pointed me
    to the Institute for [Personal Robots in
    Education](http://www.roboteducation.org/), a joint effort between
    [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu) and [Bryn Mawr
    College](http://www.brynmawr.edu/) and sponsored by [Microsoft
    Research](http://research.microsoft.com/). Their [Myro
    software](http://wiki.roboteducation.org/Myro) (myro == my robot) is
    written in CPython, but there’s an effort underway (aka [Miro
    3.0](http://wiki.roboteducation.org/Myro_3.0)) to build a .NET
    version that uses IronPython. Must investigate.

    [shows](http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/07/23/how-to-create-objects-of-types-defined-in-c-inside-a-hosted-python-script.aspx)
    how easy it is to extend C\# types in IronPython. It’s also shows
    how simple it is to host DLR code in your app – it’s like 6 lines of
    code!
-   [Early
    reviews](http://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2008/07/review-of-ironpython-in-action.html)
    of [IronPython in Action](http://www.manning.com/foord/) are good.  
-   If you want to run an IronPython IDE in your browser with
    Silverlight, check out
    [SilverShell](http://code.google.com/p/silvershell/) from Dan Eloff.
-   The XNA team has [announced their business
    plans](http://creators.xna.com/en-us/XboxLIVECommunityGames) for
    community games. Basically, you set a price point between 200 and
    800 points (aka between \$2.50 and \$10) and receive a “baseline” of
    70% of the revenue the game generates. More details are available in
    the [FAQ](http://creators.xna.com/en-us/XboxLIVECommunityGames).
    This is pretty excited. I’d like to build some co-op kids games.
-   Speaking of XNA, Caligari is now offering [TrueSpace
    7.6](http://www.caligari.com/Products/trueSpace/tS75/brochure/intro.asp?Cate=BIntro)
    for free . [David
    Weller](http://letskilldave.com/blog/truespace-7-6-is-available-for-free-and-why-you-should-care/)
    and [Glenn
    Wilson](http://www.virtualrealm.com.au/blogs/caligari-truespace-7-6-released-for-free/)
    provide an XNA viewpoint on the announcement, Chris Pendleton
    [shows](http://blogs.msdn.com/virtualearth/archive/2008/07/23/announcing-truespace-for-virtual-earth-3d-development.aspx)
    how to upload your models to VirtualEarth.
-   Congrats to the CodePlex team on [their latest
    drop](http://blogs.msdn.com/codeplex/archive/2008/07/23/codeplex-project-discussions-mailing-lists.aspx),
    which features that a cool new feature – [Mailing
    Lists](http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Mailing%20Lists&referringTitle=CodePlex%20Documentation)!
    IronPython has had a [Mailman mailing
    list](http://lists.ironpython.com/listinfo.cgi/users-ironpython.com)
    for years, so I’m not sure we’ll use this feature on IPy, but I’ll
    investigate it
-   Two PDC notes: First, Rick Rashid – VP of MS Research – will be
    [delivering a PDC
    keynote](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/View.aspx?post=91d46819-8472-40ad-a661-2c78acb4018c:8763070).
    Second, the PDC team has put up a video podcast on [Producing a
    Ginormous Conference in 10 Minutes or
    Less!](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Dan/Countdown-To-PDC2008--Producing-a-Ginormous-Conference-in-10-Minutes-or-Less/)
    It’s the “inaugural episode” so watch for more Countdown to PDC
    video podcast episodes in the future.
-   I recently discovered Chris Smith’s F\# blog. He’s got recent posts
    on [Mastering F\#
    Lists](http://blogs.msdn.com/chrsmith/archive/2008/07/10/mastering-f-lists.aspx)
    and [Guidelines for Readable F\#
    code](http://blogs.msdn.com/chrsmith/archive/2008/06/25/some-guidelines-for-readable-f-code.aspx).
    For the F\# novice, check out his F\# in 20 Minutes posts ([part
    one](http://blogs.msdn.com/chrsmith/archive/2008/05/02/f-in-20-minutes-part-i.aspx),
    [part
    two](http://blogs.msdn.com/chrsmith/archive/2008/05/09/f-in-20-minutes-part-ii.aspx))
-   Pat Helland is [moving to the SQL
    team](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2008/07/23/transferring-to-the-sql-team.aspx).
    Good luck Pat!
-   I like Nick Malik’s formal definition of use cases, but I can’t help
    be reminded of Charlie Alfred’s [Value-Driven
    Architecture](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480060.aspx)
    article in [Architecture Journal
    5](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480034.aspx) where he
    said use cases were “easy to teach and explain” but that “if
    simplicity were the only goal that counted, we’d all still be
    walking or riding horses to get from one place to another.”
