<li>My Virtual TechEd Session <a href="http://www.virtualteched.com/videos/JohnFlandersHarryPiersonsmall.asf">What is Project
Rome?</a>
got posted. It’s only 8 minutes long, so as you might expect it’s
fairly high level. Thanks to <a href="http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon/default.aspx">Jon
Flanders</a>
for handling interview duty.</li>
<li>QUT’s <a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/Ruby.NET/">Garden Point Ruby.NET</a>
compiler is now the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rubydotnetcompiler/">Ruby.NET open source
project</a>.</li>
<li>The NHL is partnering with <a href="http://www.neulion.com/">NeuLion</a> to
provide IPTV services for NHL team websites. They
<a href="http://www.neulion.com/news/2007/050707.php">piloted</a> with the
<a href="http://www.newyorkislanders.com/">Islanders</a> last season. Wouldn’t
it be cool to get <a href="http://capitals.nhl.com/">my favorite team’s</a>
IPTV channel on my <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/ces2007/microsoftintegratesiptvsoftwareplatform.htm">Xbox
360</a>?</li>
<li>Speaking of Hockey,
<div class="image-right"><img src="http://image.devhawk.net/blog-content/20070720-morning-coffee-103/NHL08_crosbydown_1.jpg" alt="Crosby Gets Checked in NHL08" /></div>
I like this new <a href="http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/14029/NHL-08-Reebok-Edge-Trailer/">NHL 08 trailer</a>.
It’s about <a href="http://www.rbkedgeuniform.com/">Reebok’s new uniform
system</a>, so it focuses on the teams
with new uniforms, including the Caps. It does feature marquee
players from rival teams like Sidney Crosby and Eric Staal (who is
the cover athlete) heavily. But any video featuring Ovechkin’s stick
handling, Semin scoring and Crosby falling to the ice is OK in my
book.</li>
<li>Speaking of Video Games, the <a href="http://www.dreambuildplay.com">XNA Dream-Build-Play
contest</a> is over. You can <a href="http://www.ziggyware.com/news.php?readmore=369">see and
download</a> some of
the submitted games over on Ziggyware. Some of them look awesome.

<li>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/07/18/morning-coffee-102/">said on
Wednesday</a>
that it was a slow week. It may be, but I’ve also been less than
motivated on pretty much all geek fronts this week. Not sure why.</li>
