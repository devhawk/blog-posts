So David Chappel is [blogging](http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/). No,
not that [David Chappel](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/207).

I’ve seen [David](http://www.davidchappell.com) speak at several MSFT
events – both internal and external. He’s great. Only downer is that
he’s using Blogger which doesn’t support RSS. But
[Web2RSS](http://web2rss.vyvojar.cz) has [created a
feed](http://web2rss.vyvojar.cz/rss/329.xml) for him.
