<p>Can you tell itâ€™s a slow day in the office?

<p>Speaking of raising the level of abstraction as well as browser based
applications, check out Nikhilâ€™s <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/Project.JSUtils.aspx">JavaScript Utilities
project</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project introduces the notion of .jsx (extended JavaScript) and
.jsa (JavaScript assembly) files. JSX files provide the ability to
include conditional code via familiar preprocessor directives such as
#if, #else, #endif and so onâ€¦The tool processes these directives in
order to produce a standard .js file. JSA files build on top of .jsx
files. While they can include normal JavaScript and preprocessor
directives, they are primarily there for including individual .jsx and
.js files via #include directives. This allows you to split your
script into more manageable individual chunks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, thatâ€™s not raising the level of abstraction much, but hereâ€™s
another example of working in a higher abstracted environment (jsx and
jsa) and then compiling down to something the underlying platform can
execute (js). Nikhil provides three ways of doing this compliation:</p>
<ol>
<li>A set of standalone tools that output standard .js files that you
can then deploy to your web site. Command line parameters are used
to control the behavior of the tools.</li>
<li>A couple of IHttpHandler implementations that allow you to
dynamically convert your code into standard .js files. This is the
mode where you can benefit from implementing per-browser code in a
conditional manner. AppSetting values in configuration are used to
control the conversion behavior.</li>
<li>As a script project in VS using an msbuild project along with an
msbuild task that comes along with the project. MSBuild project
properties are used to control the conversion behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p>If youâ€™re going to raise the level of abstraction to do implement a
preprocessor, you could also go all the way and implement an entirely
new language that gets compiled down to JavaScript for execution in the
browser. For example, Iâ€™m not as familiar or comfortable with
JavaScriptâ€™s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototype based
approach</a>. But
I could imagine a more class based language that compiles to JavaScript.
Thatâ€™s the same way early C++ compilers worked â€“ they were a
preprocessor pass that converted the C++ into C, which could then be
compiled with traditional C compilers.</p>
<p>I wonder what JavaScript++ would look like</p>
