about <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SvnBridge">SvnBridge</a>, a tool that
lets you use Subversion clients like
<a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a> to talk to <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718825.aspx">Team Foundation
Server</a>.
While I think that’s cool, I wonder is anyone interested in
subversion clients <em>other</em> than TortoiseSVN? For example, will
people choose <a href="http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/">AnkhSVN</a> instead of the
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181304(VS.80).aspx">Team Explorer
Client</a>?</li>
<li>Speaking of TortoiseSVN, I wonder if those guys are interested in
building a TortoiseTFS project? I did find two other TFS shell
extensions projects: <a href="http://blog.benday.com/archive/2007/05/18/23006.aspx">Dubbelbock
TFS</a> and
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Turtle">Turtle</a>, though neither appears as
full featured as Tortoise.</li>

VS08′s multi-targeting support. Of course, the three versions of the
.NET Framework VS08 can target all use the same underlying runtime,
which probably made it easier to build.</li>

is now available for purchase. Among other things your $59 gets
you, besides a 50% savings, is “<a href="http://powershelllive.com/">Feature request
priority</a>“. That’s pretty cool. I wonder
how many other micro-ISV’s take the approach of “pay me now and you
get to help me pick some of the new features.”</li>

<a href="http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsexperience/archive/2007/06/20/running-a-dual-monitor-setup-with-windows-vista.aspx">writes</a>
about dual monitor support in Vista. I’m loving the dual monitor
support, though I have a somewhat strange setup. I keep my primary
monitor rotated in portrait mode, which is great for reading and
writing. I typically use my second monitor for blogs and mail. I
even wrote a custom multi-mon wallpaper utility so I could easily
generate new wallpapers for my non-standard monitor layout,
including bitmap rotate support. If there’s interest, I can post it.

<li>Nick Malik
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/19/not-crazy-just-lateral-thinking.aspx">continues</a>
to write about Mort, with the usual response from the usual folks. I
liked his point that “You cannot fight economics with education”,
but otherwise I’m staying out of this discussion.</li>
<li>In the same vein, Martin Fowler
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DesignStaminaHypothesis.html">writes</a>
about Technical Debt. I completely agree with his hypothesis that
short changing design may save time in the short term but will cost
much more in the long term. However, the problem is that the people
who are making the tradeoff – i.e. the people paying for the project
NOT the people building the project – either don’t understand the
tradeoff or are more than happy to sacrifice the long term cost for
the short term gain. How are most projects measured? Being on time
and on budget with the planned set of features. Very few projects –
and none that I’ve ever seen – are goaled on long term
maintainability. Until you can change that, this issue will continue
to linger.</li>
