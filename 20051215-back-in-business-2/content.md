After an extended absence, DevHawk is back on the air (so to speak). My
pal Tom had a hardware failure and we’ve moved DevHawk onto a hosting
service. As it turns out, Tom had the hosting service set up over a
month ago and I just never got around to making the switch. So, I have
no one to blame but myself for being offline so long.

There’s much to blog about, but I’ll get to that tomorrow. This is as
much a test post as anything else.

One quick note, thanks to the relatively-new [Windows Live Custom
Domains](http://domains.live.com/), my [blog
email](mailto:devhawk@outlook.com) is also working again.
