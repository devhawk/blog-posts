<p>After an extended absence, DevHawk is back on the air (so to speak). My
pal Tom had a hardware failure and we’ve moved DevHawk onto a hosting
service. As it turns out, Tom had the hosting service set up over a
month ago and I just never got around to making the switch. So, I have
no one to blame but myself for being offline so long.</p>
<p>There’s much to blog about, but I’ll get to that tomorrow. This is as
much a test post as anything else.</p>
<p>One quick note, thanks to the relatively-new <a href="http://domains.live.com/">Windows Live Custom
Domains</a>, my <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net">blog
email</a> is also working again.</p>
