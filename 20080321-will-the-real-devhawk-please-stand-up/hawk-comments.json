    "content": "I feel as though reading a blog is a bit like being invited to dinner as a guest. The host is entitled to say what he or she wants -- it's their place and they're paying after all. However, some degree of manners towards your guests is a nice thing. People may hold different opinions and sometimes being receptive (not necessarily persuaded) is a good thing. A good discussion does not start by saying if you disagree with me you’re an idiot, evil or both. (You haven’t said that – but it feels implied)\n\nThere is also an asymmetry in your personal/political opinions. An extremely knowledgeable discussion of the technical is contrasted with a rather nasty and perhaps simple/close-minded view of the political world. (F# parsing vs. \"[so-and-so] is a douchebag\".\n\nI've always appreciated your writing so thank you. \n"
