<p>A few people <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,1a9e0102-c263-4226-b1cb-e076c94cf6bc.aspx">took
issue</a>
with me calling <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/11/dennis-miller-has-jumped-the-shark/">Dennis Miller a partisan
hack</a> while
also expressing relief that the new season of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher">Real Time with Bill
Maher</a> was starting. I finally got to
watch <a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/episode/2006_02_17_ep67.html">last Friday’s
episode</a>.
Sure, they made fun of Dick Cheney’s hunting accident and had a round of
negative things to say about this administrations handling of Iraq (one
of the guests was <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/senor-bio.html">Dan
Senor</a>, Advisor to
the U.S. Presidential Envoy in Iraq) but he also grilled Democratic
<a href="http://www.russfeingold.org/">Senator Russ Feingold</a> on the
effectiveness of <a href="http://www.russfeingold.org/cfr.php">campain finance
reform</a> and came out as
pro-wiretapping:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]f they need to listen to keep a dirty bomb from going off in Long
Beach, then I say, “Listen away.”</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>Oh, please, Americans don’t want privacy. They want attention! They’ll
put a camera in their shower and show it on the Internet! To get on
television, they’ll marry strangers and eat a cow’s rectum, and ice
dance with Todd Bridges. They’re trying to get on a show called “Big
Brother”!</p>
<p>We are a nation of exhibitionists from “me” to shining “me.” And what
we really fear isn’t that someone’s listening; it’s that no one’s
listening. This whole country is one big desperate cry for somebody to
listen to “listen to me, photograph me, Google me, read my blog! Read
my diary; read my memoir. It’s not interesting enough? I’ll make shit
up!”</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I tell you, this country gave the finger to privacy a long time ago.</p>

<p>Seems like quite a difference to Dennis Miller calling out John Kerry
and Howard Dean a year after the election and having nothing at all
negative to say about the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I’m wondering what people think of Jon Stewart of <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml">The
Daily
Show</a>
fame. Partisan Hack or Not?</p>
