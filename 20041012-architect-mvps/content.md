In addition to event activities, we also take advantage of SAF to have
side meetings with customers. Yesterday, I spent an hour discussing
software factories and high-performance computing with [Simon
Cox](http://www.soton.ac.uk/~sjc/) from the University of Southampton.
Simon is one of our inaugural group of Architect
[MVPs](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;mvpaward&style=TOC#Visual%20Developer%20-%20Solutions%20Architect).
We have fourteen architect MVPs across two categories: [Visual Developer
– Solutions
Architect](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;mvpaward&style=TOC#Visual%20Developer%20-%20Solutions%20Architect)
and [Windows Server System – Infrastructure
Architect](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;mvpaward&style=TOC#Windows%20Server%20System%20-%20Infrastructure%20Architect).
We’ll be growing this group significantly over the rest of the fiscal
year, but there are already some influential names in this group,
including [Roger Sessions](http://www.objectwatch.com/about_us.htm),
Paul Preiss (founder of [IASA](http://www.iasarchitects.org/)), [Ingo
Rammer](http://www.thinktecture.com/staff/ingo/Weblog/) and [Clemens
Vasters](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/). Congrats to all the
new Architect MVPs!
