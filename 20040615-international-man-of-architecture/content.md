My pal [Tom](http://conpro.net/) – who hosts DevHawk for me – recently
set up a traffic analyzer so I can get a better idea about who’s
visiting this site. I found it interesting that just under 52% of the
visits are coming from the US. Rounding out the top ten DevHawk visitor
countries are UK, Canada, Zimbabwe, Australia, Germany, Sweden, China,
Netherlands and France. I really dig that almost half my traffic is from
outside the US. Plus, it serves as a good reminder that getting good
content up on [Architecture
Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/) in English means we’re
still missing large chunk of the audience.
