-   I wonder what MSBuild would look like if the team had ~~cloned~~
    drawn inspiration from
    [Rake](http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html) instead of
    [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/). Seems that PowerShell would have made
    a great foundation for build scripting.
-   Looks like the digital music business is about to undergo a
    [dramatic shift](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/).
    [Nick
    Carr](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/02/jobs_calls_for.php)
    and [Mark
    Cuban](http://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/02/07/what-should-the-music-biz-do-next/)
    have more on the possible ramifications. A friend of mine is about
    to move over to the [Zune team](http://www.zune.net/). Sounds like a
    good time to making that switch.
-   Anne Manes of the Burton Group says the [time is right for
    UDDI](http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/qna/0,289202,sid26_gci1242398,00.html),
    calling it the “foundation for governance”. Frankly, I think that
    gives UDDI a lot more credit than it’s due. We’re looking at UDDI as
    part of our SO infrastructure project, and I think it’s more
    appropriately called “one piece of the puzzle”. In my experience,
    the major roadblock getting projects to share technical details is
    desire, not discoverability. Getting information into the registry
    is much easier than getting teams to use that data rather than
    succumbing to [Not Invented
    Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) syndrome. (via
    [Joe McKendrick](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=812))
-   Jeff Snover of the [PowerShell
    team](http://blogs.msdn.com/PowerShell) left [me a
    comment](http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,a73ea4af-97ef-4574-94f1-8f928e5be84f.aspx#commentstart)
    the I “get” PowerShell. “Getting” it may be a better description,
    but it’s nice to see how well engaged the PS team is in the
    community.
