    how the “unblock” feature in Windows works. Basically, when you
    download a file with IE, it adds an [alternate data
    stream](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa364404.aspx) that
    specifies the zone the file came from (Internet, Intranet, Trusted,
    etc.). Even [more

    to to reuse SSB conversations in a data syndication scenario. A
    while back, he wrote about a [lightweight pub/sub SSB
    implementation](http://blogs.msdn.com/remusrusanu/archive/2005/12/12/502942.aspx)
    – barely 200 lines of T-SQL code – that would also be very useful in
    data syndication scenarios. I’ve got data syndication on the brain
    right now, so this stuff is very timely.
