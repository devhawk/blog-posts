<p>I know how I’m celebrating my birthday this year. Well, technically the
day after my birthday.</p>
<p>I’ve always been a movie buff and, other than Star Wars, I can’t think
of a movie series that shaped the way I think about movies and movie
making as much as Indiana Jones. I remember well going to see the first
three Indiana Jones movies with my father. Of course, now I’m a father,
but Patrick and Riley aren’t really ready for Indy yet. So they’ll have
to be content with <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/legoindianajones/">Lego
Indy</a> for a few more
years.</p>
<p>Otherwise, here’s hoping Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal
Skull doesn’t suffer from Star Wars prequel-itis.</p>
