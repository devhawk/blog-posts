<p>I was able to catch an earlier flight home last night (which was itself
delayed, but still got me home an hour and a half earlier than
expected). Combined with the work that piled up while I was gone and I
haven’t gotten around to the rest of my thoughts on Mashup Camp. Until
now…</p>
<ul>
<li>This should have been in the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/20/thoughts-from-mashup-camp-day-1/">day one
update</a>,
but we had a great presentation Monday night on the History of
Computer Marketing. Very interesting and very entertaining.</li>
<li>It was good to see <a href="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/02/making-the-scene-at-mashup-camp">Marc
Canter</a>.</li>
<li>There were fewer sessions on Tuesday because a significant amount of
time was taken up on “speed geeking”. Supposedly similar to speed
dating, but with mashup demos instead of dates. In actuality, it was
more like demo anarchy with loud annoying buzzing.</li>
<li>I spent a significant time with the folks from <a href="http://www.bungeelabs.com/">Bungee
Labs</a> (no relation to the <a href="http://www.bungie.net/">makers of
Halo</a>). Like Ning, they are a web / mashup
development site. However, where Ning appears to be going after the
hobbyist, Bungee Labs is going after the enterprise. They had a cool
demo of a SalesForce.com &amp; Exchange mashup with maps.</li>
<li>I was very impressed with
<a href="http://www.weatherbonk.com/">WeatherBonk</a>. In particular, the way
they overlay the map with radar and fog information. They also make
<a href="http://www.skibonk.com/">SkiBonk</a>.</li>
<li>I sat in on the <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?HAtomFinalization">Microformats Specification
Work</a>
session, but didn’t get much out of it as it was a face-to-face
meeting of core microformats folks rather than the “What are
<a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?MicroFormats">Microformats”
session</a> that I
didn’t make the first day (conflict with <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?MonetizationBizModels">Mashup Business Model
session</a>)</li>
<li>There was a session on Firefox futures, but it was lame. You can get
more from just reading the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox:2.0_Product_Planning">Firefox 2 product
planning</a> wiki
page. Interestingly enough, if you look at their <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox2/Features">list of
features</a> for Firefox 2,
only one is of any use to the web developer: In-line Spell Check.
Everything else improves the chrome. Their priority one features
are: <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Places">new bookmark and history
system</a>, <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Tabbed_Browsing">tabbed browsing UI
improvements</a>, extension
manager enhancements, <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Search_Service">search engine UI
improvements</a>, and an update
to the  browser appearance. As I wrote in <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/02/browser-as-virtual-machine/">Browser as
VM</a>,
we’ve reached an inertia point where it’s hard for a browser vendor
to add new proprietary capabilities that only work on their browser.
Same goes for Microsoft – read the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B2AC8F30-2D88-45B6-90AE-ED266161F463&amp;displaylang=en">IE7 Technology
Overview</a>
and while there is great work on things like security and the RSS
platform, there are no new web developer feature, just bug fixes,
better standards support and a native XmlHttpRequest object. I
wonder what it’s going to take to get new capabilities added to
arguably the most important virtual machine platform in the world.</li>
<li><a href="http://podbop.org/">Podbop</a> won the mashup contest. <a href="http://www.chicagocrime.org/">Chicago
Crime</a> came in second. Frankly, I was
much more impressed with Chicago Crime.</li>
<li>As the winner of the mashup contest, the guy that wrote Podbop got a
Sun server. Second prize was a new intel-based Mac. And ten third
place finishers got copies of Visual Studio Pro. Given that none of
the mashup content entrants were built on Microsoft technology, I’d
be interested to know how excited the third place finishers were
about getting a copy of VS.</li>
<li>I met a lot of great people at Mashup Camp (which is the primary
reason I went) but above all I really got a lot out of hanging out
with the MS folks who were there. We’re such a big company that it’s
hard to keep abreast of what’s going on, so this kind of
face-to-face time is invaluable.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it, at least until <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?MashupCamp2">Mashup Camp
2</a>.</p>
