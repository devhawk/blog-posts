<li>I took the kids to see <a href="http://www.flymetothemoonthemovie.com/">Fly Me To The
Moon</a> recently. We had to
trek to Monroe (about 30 minutes away) because it’s a special 3D
movie, and it was only playing there and in downtown Seattle. The
movie’s story is insipid – three flies stow away on Apollo 11 – but
all the space shots were actually kinda cool. It sure felt like they
wanted to be scientifically and historically accurate about the the
actual mission (well, other than the part about the flies). Patrick
really liked it (he wants to build a rocket in the back yard) and
Riley sat thru the whole thing with a minimum of fussing.</li>
<li>I’m a big fan of Joe Biden, so I’m really happy Obama <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26365828/">picked
him</a> to be his running mate.</li>
<li>I know it’s old news but what the frak was John Edwards thinking? I
like his policies, but the arrogance it takes to run for president
when you know you’ve got that skeleton in your closet is
mind-boggling.</li>
<li>On the other hand, watching the Sean Hannity and guest’s hypocrisy
on Edwards’ affair, only to watch them <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da4N-CTTRIM">scramble like
cockroaches</a> when Colmes
points out McCain had admitted to having an affair was frakking
hilarious.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, onto geek stuff:</p>

<li>My new boss Dave Remy has moved to a <a href="http://blog.remlog.net/">new
blog</a>. If you’re curious what he was up to
for the 10 months he was away from Microsoft, he’s <a href="http://blog.remlog.net/?p=4">happy to
share</a>.</li>
<li>IPy and IRuby developer Curt Hagenlocher (aka Iron Curt) is
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/curth/">blogging</a>. Cue the Ozzy…I AM IRON
CURT. Or don’t. Anyway, he dives in the deep end of the pool – no
“hello world” lollyblogging for Iron Curt – digging into the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/curth/archive/2008/07/29/stackoverflowexception-and-ironpython.aspx">stack
implications of rethrowing
exceptions</a>
and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/curth/archive/2008/08/12/viewing-emitted-il.aspx">debugging emitted
IL</a>.</li>
<li>Srivatsn writes about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/srivatsn/archive/2008/08/06/static-compilation-of-ironpython-scripts.aspx">static compilation of IPy
scripts</a>.
Note, we’re not talking about static typing – it’s still the same
good-old dynamically typed IronPython, just packaged up as an
assembly, rather than as a bunch of .py files. Note, if you’re
interested in compiling IronPython, you should check out the PYC
sample we published as part of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=14353">Beta
4</a>.</li>
<li>Speaking of IPy Beta 4, Shri Borde posts about the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shrib/archive/2008/07/30/idispatch-support-on-in-ironpython-beta-4.aspx">COM dispatch
support</a>
which is enabled by default as of Beta 4. If you’re driving COM
automation clients (like Office) from IPy, this is a huge
improvement over the old mechanism.</li>
<li>Jeff Hardy has released a new version of NWSGI, a managed version of
Python’s <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">Web <del>Service</del> Server Gateway
Interface</a>. My
understanding is that this would allow any Python web stack written
against WSGI to run in IIS with IronPython (subject to IronPython’s
compatibility with CPython). Jeff’s been
<a href="http://jdhardy.blogspot.com/">documenting</a> his efforts getting
Django running with NWSGI on his blog. Awesome work Jeff! (Thanks
for the correction Seo!)</li>
<li>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/08/the-so-called-attention-economy/">never really bought
into</a>
the “Attention Economy”, but Chris Anderson’s <a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2008/08/i-wish-people-w.html">economic
analysis</a>
of his DIY Drones site traffic was fascinating.</li>
<li>Lutz announces “<a href="http://blog.lutzroeder.com/2008/08/future-of-net-reflector.html">it is time to move
on</a>”
from Reflector and there was a collective horrified scream in the
.NET community. He’s handing it over to Red Gate, who
<a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/opinion-pieces/the-future-of-reflector-/">promised</a>
they “will continue to offer the tool for free to the community”.</li>
<li>I missed this when he posted it in June, but I really liked Nikhil
Kothari <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/ViewModel-Pattern-DLR.aspx">use of the
DLR</a> in
Silverlight to cut down on the XAML verbosity in his ViewModel
action binding.</li>
<li>Brian McNamara previews the new <a href="http://lorgonblog.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!701679AD17B6D310!307.entry">Add
Reference</a>
and <a href="http://lorgonblog.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!701679AD17B6D310!347.entry">file
ordering</a>
support in the upcoming F# CTP. I’m really looking forward to the
project-to-project reference support. I can’t tell you how many
times I’ve gotten burned because my main project recompiled but my
test project didn’t. You just get used to hitting Rebuild All
instead of Build. As for file ordering, it’s a bit of a bummer that
F# requires it, but the new experience is hella better than editing
the project file by hand. I’m <em>really</em> looking forward to the new
CTP.</li>
</ul>
