[Scott W](http://aspnetweblog.com/) and [Early
Adopter](http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/) have discovered the [WMI
Management
Extension](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=62d91a63-1253-4ea6-8599-68fb3ef77de1&displaylang=en)
for VS.NET 2003. This was
[available](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=EF7594D3-4907-4AF6-B7D8-6E22115FFAF0)
for VS.NET 2002 as well. One of the cool features is
[generating](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/WMISE/wmitskaddingwmiobjectstoproject.asp?frame=true)
strongly typed classes for accessing WMI information.

There’s a similar Server Explorer
[extension](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C82D7AB5-40A5-4DD4-9595-53A79FF2C5BC&displaylang=en)
for Active Directory. Unfortunately, it only works with VS.NET 2002 so
far.

Not to leave the loosely coupled XML crowd out, there’s now Directory
Service Markup Language (DSML)
[support](http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/dsml.asp)
for Active Directory. Includes a SOAP listener. Cool.
