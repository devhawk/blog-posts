-   I only posted one Morning Coffee post last week. It wasn’t a lack of
    content, it was a lack of drive on my part. I had 20-30 items
    flagged in my news reader, but for some reason I couldn’t work up
    the interest in posting them. So some of these are a bit old.
-   I’m at the Language.NET Symposium this week, so look for lots of
    language blogging. I’ve already chatted with [Tomáš
    Petříček](http://tomasp.net/) and [John
    Lam](http://www.iunknown.com/). If someone [kicks Ted Neward’s
    ass](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/25/By+The+Way+If+Anybody+Wants+To+Argue+About+Languages+Next+Week.aspx)
    because he [hates
    Perl](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/25/So+I+Dont+Like+Perl+Sue+Me.aspx),
    I’ll try and liveblog it.
-   Speaking of Ted Neward, he
    [discusses](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/24/Can+Dynamic+Languages+Scale.aspx)
    the question “Can Dynamic Languages Scale?” without devolving into a
    flame-fest. I agree 100% with his point about the difference between
    performance scaling and complexity scaling. Personally, I tend to
    err on the side of better complexity scaling, since buying hardware
    is easier than hiring developers.

    [responds](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2008/01/23/the-future-can-be-seen-if-we-decide-to-look.aspx)
    to me calling his shared global integration vision
    [flawed](http://devhawk.net/2008/01/22/nicks-flawed-vision-of-a-shared-integration-model/).
    He points to NGOSS/eTOM as an example of a shared iterative model
    that works. I know squat about that shared model, so I’ll refrain
    from commenting until I do a little homework on the telco industry.
-   Speaking of shared interop models, Microsoft is [joining
    DataPortability.org](http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2008/01/24/203.aspx).
    [Dare
    Obasanjo](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/01/24/MicrosoftJoinsDataportabilityorg.aspx)
    and [Marc
    Canter](http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2008/01/dataportabilityorg-gradually-eeking-its-way-out-of-the-reality-distortion-echo-chamber#comments)
    are skeptical that so far this effort is all hype and no substance.
    Reminds me a bit of AttentionTrust.org. But if DataPortability.org
    can get off the ground, maybe there’s hope for Nick’s vision (or
    vis-versa).
-   Don Syme [lists what’s
    new](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/01/25/update-to-the-f-1-9-3-release.aspx)
    in the latest F\# release. As I said, this release is pretty light
    on features. Hopefully, I’ll get some details
-   Tomas Restrepo
    [shows](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2008/01/24/ModifyingTheHomeInPowerShell.aspx)
    how to change your home folder in PowerShell. I need to do this.
