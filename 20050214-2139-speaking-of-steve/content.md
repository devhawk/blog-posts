BTW, if you haven’t seen [Steve’s](http://hyperthink.net/blog) 
[entry on Isomorphism](http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,46c804f0-1384-4752-9519-182d407f9253.aspx),
go read it right now. He nails this whole services as contracts vs.
services as code debate right on the head. The spot on nature of this

on the head – another must read post if you haven’t already.
