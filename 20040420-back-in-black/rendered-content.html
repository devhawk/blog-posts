<p>It’s been a busy week. I was on <a href="http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=61">.NET
Rocks</a>,
we published <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal">JOURNAL</a>
and I seem to have stirred up some discussion with my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/04/12/is-the-middle-tier-endangered/">endangered
middle-tier
post</a>.</p>
<p>But then I was silenced by a floppy disk.</p>
<p>My friend Tom, who hosts DevHawk and
<a href="http://techiewife.com">TechieWife</a> for me, is on a contract job
out-of-state and couldn’t remotely diagnose why the web server that
hosts this blog wouldn’t reboot after a power-outage. Turns out there
was a floppy in the drive and go figure, the server tried to boot from
the floppy. So I’ve been offline all week. Still, I have to give Tom
props as</p>
<ol>
<li>He hosts me for free</li>
<li>I have admin access to the machine</li>
<li>He’s down to try new things</li>
</ol>
<p>Being on .NET Rocks last week reminded my a little of my old <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/09/17/pressplay-and-college-radio/">college DJ
days</a>.
I’ve got an idea I’d like to play around, but I’d need a media server.
That’s where #3 above comes into play. I ask Tom and I receive. No idea
what I’m going to do with it yet, but now I have a media server to play
with. Thanks, Tom…You Rock!</p>
