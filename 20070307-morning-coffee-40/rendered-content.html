<li>My boss let me borrow a Tecra M4 that he scavenged from his boss.
The display is fairly twitchy, I think it’s a motherboard issue. But
it’s very intermittent and I’ll get help desk to take a look. In the
meantime, it sure is nice to driving a Tablet PC again. And it’s
Vista ready to boot.</li>
<li>Speaking of Vista, Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 Update for
Windows Vista. It’s a mouthful but it’s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=90E2942D-3AD1-4873-A2EE-4ACC0AACE5B6&amp;displaylang=en">now
available</a>.

<li>The DSL tools team keeps on rolling with the power toys. First it
was the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bfba74af-4f28-44cc-8de5-0c3c55d21863&amp;displaylang=en">Designer Integration

<li>I missed the TechFest keynote yesterday, but it’s <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/">available on
demand</a>. They also have
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/demos.aspx">descriptions</a>
and
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/videos/default.aspx">videos</a> of
some of the technologies on display. (well, only one video so far,
but I assume since the page is labeled “TechFest 2007 Videos” that
more are on the way.)</li>
<li>There’s new support for integrating WCF and WF coming in VS “Orcas”.

details</a>
on what’s new for WF &amp; WCF in the latest CTP drop. For me
personally, the WCF/WF integration is some of the most important
stuff coming in Orcas, second only to LINQ.</li>
