-   Morning Coffee was canceled on Thursday and Friday on account of a
    kidney stone. So not fun. Luckily, it was a little one and it was
    alone, but I will be listening very closely to my doctor’s advice to
    avoid another.
-   Took the kids to see
    [Ratatouille](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/) last Tuesday and
    saw [Transformers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/) yesterday
    with my wife due to fluke babysitter luck. I liked Ratatouille, but
    I’m not sure it’s the [51st best
    movie](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?tt0382932) of all time. On the
    other hand, major props for making a kid movie with a significant
    lack of toy tie-ins. Ratatouille is a better movie that
    [Cars](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/), but I don’t see my
    four year old boy trading in is Lightning McQueen toy car for a Remy
    the Rat. Transformers on the other hand obviously did not forgo the
    toy tie-ins! Still, it wasn’t bad. Kinda reminded me of [The
    Rock](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/) with a bigger budget.

    that C\# is getting fat. Or maybe it’s just big-boned. My take: no
    question that integrated query is a big feature that covers a lot of
    surface area. But given the prevalence of databases and other
    queriable stores, it’s critical to improving programmer
    productivity. Go read [Todd
    Proebsting’s](http://research.microsoft.com/~toddpro/) talk on
    [Disruptive Programming Language
    Technologies](http://research.microsoft.com/papers/disruptive.ppt).
    Two of his candidates for disruptive language technologies were
    Database Integration and Manipulating XML. LINQ neatly covers both.
-   [According to John
    Shewchuck](http://connectedsystems.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!10E0A1CD60CAE1A9!265.entry),
    the new BizTalk Services release is available. However, when I click
    on the “[what’s new](http://labs.biztalk.net/WhatsNew.aspx)” page,
    it tells me they’re experiencing technical difficulties. (Their
    error page is Oops.aspx. Funny!)
-   Scott Hanselman has [Programming Personas
    2.0](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BeyondElvisEinsteinAndMortNewProgrammingStereotypesForWeb20.aspx).
    Who are you? I thought I was and “Order n” Architect (the quote
    “Where’s the whiteboard” is spot on) but my CS background isn’t as
    strong as the persona’s.
-   Sam Gentile is [starting to
    dig](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/07/08/parallel-computing-and-concurrency-on-net.aspx)
    into Concurrency and he has a great list of links that have
    influenced his design.
