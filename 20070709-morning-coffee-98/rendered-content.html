<li>Morning Coffee was canceled on Thursday and Friday on account of a
kidney stone. So not fun. Luckily, it was a little one and it was
alone, but I will be listening very closely to my doctor’s advice to
avoid another.</li>
<li>Took the kids to see
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/">Ratatouille</a> last Tuesday and
saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/">Transformers</a> yesterday
with my wife due to fluke babysitter luck. I liked Ratatouille, but
I’m not sure it’s the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?tt0382932">51st best
movie</a> of all time. On the
other hand, major props for making a kid movie with a significant
lack of toy tie-ins. Ratatouille is a better movie that
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/">Cars</a>, but I don’t see my
four year old boy trading in is Lightning McQueen toy car for a Remy
the Rat. Transformers on the other hand obviously did not forgo the
toy tie-ins! Still, it wasn’t bad. Kinda reminded me of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/">The
Rock</a> with a bigger budget.</li>

that C# is getting fat. Or maybe it’s just big-boned. My take: no
question that integrated query is a big feature that covers a lot of
surface area. But given the prevalence of databases and other
queriable stores, it’s critical to improving programmer
productivity. Go read <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/%7Etoddpro/">Todd
Proebsting’s</a> talk on
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/papers/disruptive.ppt">Disruptive Programming Language
Technologies</a>.
Two of his candidates for disruptive language technologies were
Database Integration and Manipulating XML. LINQ neatly covers both.</li>

the new BizTalk Services release is available. However, when I click
on the “<a href="http://labs.biztalk.net/WhatsNew.aspx">what’s new</a>” page,
it tells me they’re experiencing technical difficulties. (Their
error page is Oops.aspx. Funny!)</li>
