-   I got my Tecra M4 back sans flaky motherboard. That’s my full time
    laptop now – it’s nice to have a laptop that supports Vista. I’m
    still running XP on my desktop out of a combination of lack of video
    driver + laziness. I run dual monitor with my primary monitor
    rotated to be portrait instead of landscape. Easier to read websites
    and documents that way. Unfortunately, while there’s a generic WDDM
    driver for my video card’s chipset, it doesn’t support the rotate
    function. But according to the Dell support site, they released a
    new driver for my card a few weeks ago so maybe it’s time to try the
    upgrade again.
-   I sat down to watch [Heroes](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/) last night,
    forgetting that it’s not on again until April. Watched
    [24](http://fox.com/24/) instead, but it has really [jumped the
    shark](http://www.jumptheshark.com).
-   Scott Guthrie continues his series on new Orcas language features,
    this time covering [extension
    methods](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/03/13/new-orcas-language-feature-extension-methods.aspx).
    On the one hand, it’s pure syntactic sugar. On the other, how sweet
    it is. It’s kinda surprising that no other mainstream language has
    done this before.
-   Scott Hansleman is a self-described [managed code
    snob](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ManagedSnobism.aspx). What do
    you call the opposite of a managed code snob? An unmanaged code snob
    or a managed code bigot?
