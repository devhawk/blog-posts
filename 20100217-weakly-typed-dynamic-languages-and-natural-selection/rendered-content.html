<p>I’m not reading much in the way of blogs or twitter these days – way to
heads down in my new job for that right now. But I did see Scott
Hanselman’s post on <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BackToBasicsC4MethodOverloadingAndDynamicTypes.aspx">method overloading and dynamic
types</a>
and Ted Neward’s follow-on post <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2010/02/14/Dont+Fear+The+DynamicVARIANTReaper.aspx">static-typing
fundamentalism</a>.
Even though I’ve moved on from the IronPython team, dynamic typing is a
topic that’s still <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/you_had_me_at_dynamic_shirt-235421109922997983">near and dear to my
heart</a>
so I can’t resist throwing in my 2¢.</p>
<p>First off, I agree 100% with Ted’s post – though not the over-the-top
mocking tone. These static &gt; dynamic flame bait comments are so tired
that they’ve literally become cliché. I agree with Ted’s points, but by
answering fire with fire he’s just perpetuating the flame war that he
claims to be so tired of. I really am tired of it, so I’m not going to
bother to address any of the original anti-dynamic typing faux-arguments
(fauxguments?) nor Ted’s artful and devastatingly mocking takedown of
them.</p>
<p>But I do have a question for any static-typing fundamentalists in the
audience: if static typing is so much better than dynamic typing, then
how come dynamically typed languages are so popular? Doesn’t natural
selection apply to type systems?</p>
<p>Those aren’t rhetorical questions. Building software takes time and
effort. While developers often donate time and effort to projects (see:
open source) typically they work for money. That money has to come from
somewhere – usually it comes from someone who needs the software built
for some business reason. And the people footing the bill for software
construction demand the highest return on investment they can get.</p>
<p>If dynamic typing or VARIANT (which is actually weak not dynamic typing,
but I digress) really did create “horrific devastation”, wouldn’t that
have caused a negative feedback loop where the business people who
actually foot the bills for creating software became wary and untrusting
of using VB as the language of choice for their projects in favor of
strong and statically typed languages that helped developers “make good
choices”?</p>
<p>Yet the opposite happened. VB was the most popular programming language
in the world for the better part of a decade. And while VB’s reign at
the top is over, I’d argue that these days the most popular programming
languages are PHP and JavaScript, both of which are weakly typed dynamic
languages too.</p>
<p>Now clearly, popular != better. However, static-typing fundamentalism
isn’t an argument about which way is “better” so much as an argument
about which way is “worthy”. But how can you argue that you’re approach
is the only worthy path when the opposite approach has been so
successful? Remember, one developer’s “horrific devastation” might be
another businessman’s “successful project because it helped me enter a
new market faster than my competitors”. </p>
