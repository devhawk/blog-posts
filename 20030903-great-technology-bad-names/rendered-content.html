<p>Ok, so you have this cool sounding technology called SPOT. People are
impressed that you, Microsoft, have come up with a cool way to send
information to your watch. So what do you do? Hide the technology
under a crappy name like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/spot/about.mspx">MSN
Direct</a>. So does
that mean I have to have MSN? What if I already have AOL? Every part
of Microsoft that I have come into contact with has impressed me,
except for marketing‚Ä¶ marketing causes Microsoft more headaches that
any other department. (Just think about .NET) [<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/javery/posts/26146.aspx">.Avery

customers, I‚Äôve given up on the marketing department. I tell customers

<li>Argue/flame if you like, but
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/MTS.asp">MTS</a> was the first of
the modern application servers. (The original version of EJB was
essentially a clone of MTS.) But did we make a big deal about it?
No, we shipped it as an ‚Äúadditional technology‚Äù included in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/techresources/appserv/optionpack/ntopdg.asp">NT
4 Option
Pack</a>.
As if it was optional.</li>
<li>Windows 2000? Is that the new version of Windows 98?
üò¶</li>
<li>MTS at least stood for something. What the heck does
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/COMPlus.asp">COM+</a> stand for?</li>
</ul>
