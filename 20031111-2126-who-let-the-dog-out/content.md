My “dog” David White started a
[blog](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/dwhite/). And he [blames
me](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/dwhite/PermaLink.aspx/4b239d5f-44f2-4b23-a85c-23c3413d0d20)
for “shaming” him into doing it. That’s a first – I’ve never shamed
anyone into doing anything. I’m not sure I really shamed David –
“pestered” may be a better term.
