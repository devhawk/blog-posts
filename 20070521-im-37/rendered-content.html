<p>No, I’m not referring to <a href="http://viewaskew.com/sounds/clerks/37.wav">this hilarious
line</a> from Clerks. It’s my
birthday today – can you guess which one?</p>
<p>(note, there’s no real point to this post, except to have “I’m 37!?!” in
the title. Let’s just say I’m a big Kevin Smith fan. In case you haven’t
see Clerks, <a href="http://viewaskew.com/clerks/sounds.html">most lines</a> from
that movie are NSFW. )</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: David Ing’s son <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=01e087e8-0a58-4003-96cb-ed36bae3338d">broke his
arm</a>
over the weekend. That led David to write “If you are away from your
family a lot then my advice would be to fix that as quickly as you
can.” +1 on that sentiment. I went from field architect evangelist
(travel requirement ~50%) to HQ architect evangelist (travel
requirement ~10%) when Patrick was born. Of course in MSIT, I almost
never travel, something my whole family appreciates. Something to be
thankful for as I turn a year older.</p>
