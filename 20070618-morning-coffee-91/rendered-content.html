<li>I’m starting to really dig <a href="http://www.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari Books
Online</a>. Having a tablet really
helps here, I can sit in bed and read and it’s ALMOST like reading a
real book. Is there an offline experience? Something like the
<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/NYTimesReaderWPFsFirstKillerApp.aspx">NYTimes WPF Reader

would be killer.</li>
<li>I’m not a Twitter guy, but I like the idea of using it to <a href="http://thomasfreudenberg.com/blog/archive/2007/06/17/twitter-publisher-for-cruisecontrol-net.aspx">publish
CI
results</a>.
Not quite as cool as using the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson/articles/169058.aspx">Ambient
Orb</a>, but
close. (via

the dogfood usage of TFS in Developer Division. Sorta interesting if
you’re into knowing that stuff. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/">Brian
Harry</a> apparently has much more.</li>
<li>I realize that linking to Pat Helland every time he writes something
is fairly redundant. If you want <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/rss.xml">his
feed</a>, you know where to
find it. But he writes great stuff! The latest is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/06/14/accountants-don-t-use-erasers.aspx">Accountants Don’t
Use
Erasers</a>,
which talks about append-only computing. His point that the database
is a cache of the transaction log is mind blowing, yet makes total
sense.</li>

WCF’s new Durable Service support in .NET 3.5. I get the need for
the [DurableServiceBehavior] attribute, but do I really have to
adorn each of the service methods with [DurableOperationBehavior]
too? That seems redundant. Also, I wonder how this looks at the
channel layer?</li>
<li>Speaking of WCF’s channel layer, I recently picked up a copy of
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/9610.aspx">Inside Windows Communication
Foundation</a> by
<a href="http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jsmith/default.aspx">Justin
Smith</a>. This
is the first book I’ve found that has more coverage of the channel
layer than the service layer, so I like it.</li>
<li>Dare
<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/06/16/Web3SARESTfulProtocolForAccessingWindowsLiveServices.aspx">writes</a>
about <a href="http://dev.live.com/livedata/web3s.htm">Web3S</a>, Windows
Live’s general purpose REST protocol. Apparently, WL <a href="http://www.goland.org/appanddare/">started with
Atom Publishing Protocol</a>, but
found that it didn’t meet their needs around hierarchy and granular
updates. David Ing
<a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6fbc1aec-8096-4e21-a015-12ede6fc9646">says</a>
it’s “not that similar” to my concept of REST, but I going to read
the spec before I comment.</li>
<li>Scott Hanselman
<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/ScottHanselman/%7E3/125204676/TeachingChildrenAndKidsToProgramTheOldSchoolWay.aspx">writes</a>
about how he learned to program and some thoughts about teaching his
son. Patrick has recently started expressing interest in programming
(he want’s to do what Daddy does). At four, I’m thinking I’ll start
him on <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=783">Scratch</a>
(though <a href="http://www.toontalk.com/">ToonTalk</a> looks interesting). As
he gets older, I was thinking about
<a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a>, though I’m a smalltalk noob. I
really like Scott’s idea of creating a connection to the physical
world via something like <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/">Mindstorms</a>.
Patrick loves Lego almost as much as his dad, so that would be cool.</li>
