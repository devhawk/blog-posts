    I’m a very lucky man.
-   I’m starting to really dig [Safari Books
    Online](http://www.safaribooksonline.com/). Having a tablet really
    helps here, I can sit in bed and read and it’s ALMOST like reading a
    real book. Is there an offline experience? Something like the
    [NYTimes WPF Reader
    app](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/NYTimesReaderWPFsFirstKillerApp.aspx)
    would be killer.
-   I’m not a Twitter guy, but I like the idea of using it to [publish
    CI
    results](http://thomasfreudenberg.com/blog/archive/2007/06/17/twitter-publisher-for-cruisecontrol-net.aspx).
    Not quite as cool as using the [Ambient
    Orb](http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson/articles/169058.aspx), but
    close. (via
    [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/opensource/Twitter_Publisher_for_CruiseControl_NET))

    the dogfood usage of TFS in Developer Division. Sorta interesting if
    you’re into knowing that stuff. [Brian
    Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/) apparently has much more.
-   I realize that linking to Pat Helland every time he writes something
    is fairly redundant. If you want [his
    feed](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/rss.xml), you know where to
    find it. But he writes great stuff! The latest is [Accountants Don’t
    Use
    Erasers](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/06/14/accountants-don-t-use-erasers.aspx),
    which talks about append-only computing. His point that the database
    is a cache of the transaction log is mind blowing, yet makes total
    sense.

    WCF’s new Durable Service support in .NET 3.5. I get the need for
    the [DurableServiceBehavior] attribute, but do I really have to
    adorn each of the service methods with [DurableOperationBehavior]
    too? That seems redundant. Also, I wonder how this looks at the
    channel layer?
-   Speaking of WCF’s channel layer, I recently picked up a copy of
    [Inside Windows Communication
    Foundation](http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/9610.aspx) by
    [Justin
    Smith](http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jsmith/default.aspx). This
    is the first book I’ve found that has more coverage of the channel
    layer than the service layer, so I like it.

    about [Web3S](http://dev.live.com/livedata/web3s.htm), Windows
    Live’s general purpose REST protocol. Apparently, WL [started with
    Atom Publishing Protocol](http://www.goland.org/appanddare/), but
    found that it didn’t meet their needs around hierarchy and granular
    updates. David Ing
    [says](http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6fbc1aec-8096-4e21-a015-12ede6fc9646)
    it’s “not that similar” to my concept of REST, but I going to read
    the spec before I comment.

    [writes](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/125204676/TeachingChildrenAndKidsToProgramTheOldSchoolWay.aspx)
    about how he learned to program and some thoughts about teaching his
    son. Patrick has recently started expressing interest in programming
    (he want’s to do what Daddy does). At four, I’m thinking I’ll start
    him on [Scratch](http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=783)
    (though [ToonTalk](http://www.toontalk.com/) looks interesting). As
    he gets older, I was thinking about
    [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org/), though I’m a smalltalk noob. I
    really like Scott’s idea of creating a connection to the physical
    world via something like [Mindstorms](http://mindstorms.lego.com/).
    Patrick loves Lego almost as much as his dad, so that would be cool.
