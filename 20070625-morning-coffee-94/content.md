-   By [most
    accounts](http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2007/06/recapping-caps-draft.html),
    the Capitals had a good draft this weekend. They started the day
    with ten picks across the seven rounds. The ended the day with ten
    prospects as well as three extra picks next year, including two
    second rounders. According to the GM George McPhee (aka GMGM), next
    year’s is “[supposed to be a terrific
    draft](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/23/AR2007062301097.html)”
    which is probably true but what you always say when you trade down
    for future picks. On the other hand, if the [guys you
    want](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/capitalsinsider/2007/06/notes_from_columbus.html)
    are available further down, why not stock up on the future picks?

    [reports](http://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/steve-yegge-por.html) on
    [Steve Yegge’s](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/) Rails port to
    JavaScript that he saw at Foo Camp. Google (aka Steve’s employer)
    wasn’t interested in adopting Ruby or Rails since they already use
    C++, Java, JavaScript and Python. So Steve ported Rails to
    JavaScript. Wow. However, it does beg the question which is more
    valuable, Ruby or Rails? If you could have just one or the other,
    which would you choose?
-   Speaking of dynamic languages, [Powershell Community
    Extensions](http://www.codeplex.com/PowerShellCX) v1.1 is out. I
    want to check out the new [Elevate
    function](http://keithhill.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!5A8D2641E0963A97!764.entry?_c=BlogPart).
    Currently, I’m using the [Script Elevation
    PowerToys](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2007/06/UtilitySpotlight/default.aspx),
    but I would rather have a pure PS solution. (via [Powershell Team

-   I always know it’s a slow day when I decide to check
    [TechMeme](http://www.techmeme.com/) while writing my Morning Coffee
    post. Usually, I get plenty to write about from just my news
    reading. However, [right now](http://www.techmeme.com/070625/h1240),
    even TechMeme seems mostly uninteresting. Only thing remotely
    interesting to me is Samsung’s new [64GB solid state
    drive](http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/25/samsungs-64gb-ssds-ready-to-roll/).
