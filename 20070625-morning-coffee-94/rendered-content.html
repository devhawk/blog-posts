the Capitals had a good draft this weekend. They started the day
with ten picks across the seven rounds. The ended the day with ten
prospects as well as three extra picks next year, including two
second rounders. According to the GM George McPhee (aka GMGM), next
year’s is “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/23/AR2007062301097.html">supposed to be a terrific
draft</a>”
which is probably true but what you always say when you trade down
for future picks. On the other hand, if the <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/capitalsinsider/2007/06/notes_from_columbus.html">guys you
want</a>
are available further down, why not stock up on the future picks?</li>

<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve Yegge’s</a> Rails port to
JavaScript that he saw at Foo Camp. Google (aka Steve’s employer)
wasn’t interested in adopting Ruby or Rails since they already use
C++, Java, JavaScript and Python. So Steve ported Rails to
JavaScript. Wow. However, it does beg the question which is more
valuable, Ruby or Rails? If you could have just one or the other,
which would you choose?</li>
<li>Speaking of dynamic languages, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PowerShellCX">Powershell Community
Extensions</a> v1.1 is out. I
want to check out the new <a href="http://keithhill.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!5A8D2641E0963A97!764.entry?_c=BlogPart">Elevate
function</a>.
Currently, I’m using the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2007/06/UtilitySpotlight/default.aspx">Script Elevation
PowerToys</a>,
but I would rather have a pure PS solution. (via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2007/06/24/powershell-community-extensions-pscx-v1-1-1.aspx">Powershell Team

<li>I always know it’s a slow day when I decide to check
<a href="http://www.techmeme.com/">TechMeme</a> while writing my Morning Coffee
post. Usually, I get plenty to write about from just my news
reading. However, <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/070625/h1240">right now</a>,
even TechMeme seems mostly uninteresting. Only thing remotely
interesting to me is Samsung’s new <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/25/samsungs-64gb-ssds-ready-to-roll/">64GB solid state
drive</a>.</li>
