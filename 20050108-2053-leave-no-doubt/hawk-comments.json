    "content": "I disagree on the Auburn comment- I think they can make a credible claim. They had a close game with Va. Tech, which probably should have beaten USC earlier in the season. That was a very close game with some questionable calls. Those kinds of calls are part of every game though, and USC did win. But it was close (closer than the score indicates). Also, I think it is clear that the SEC is a tougher conference to play in, and Auburn ran the table.\n\nHaving said all that, my personal opinion is that USC proved that they deserve it this year.",

    "content": "Well, we can agree on this.  USC is the proud new owner of an uncontested national championship, and it is well deserved.  I personally don't think things like \"how convincing was the win\" should come into play in the rankings, but the bottom line is, while I think Auburn would have put up more of a fight than OU, I don't think they would have won.  USC came to play, and claimed their national title with fervor.\n\nCongrats.",
