<p>And no, this story isn’t made up. Let me just quote one of the folks
at this conference: <em>“I truly believe that most of this world’s
business logic is implemented in Excel”.</em> [<a href="http://www.ingorammer.com/Weblog/default.aspx?day=2003-03-07#20030307225900">Ingo Rammer’s

<p>According to my friends at <a href="http://www.fsw.fujitsu.com/">Fujitsu Software
Corporation</a>, 70% of the worlds business
logic is still in <a href="http://www.cobolportal.com/">COBOL</a>. Of course, with
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnofftalk/html/office12092002.asp">Visual Studio Tools for
Office</a>
and Fujitsu’s <a href="http://www.netcobol.com/dotnet/index.html">NetCOBOL for
.NET</a>, you could conceivably
migrate the COBOL code directly into Excel. And no, I’m not making this
up either!
