<li>I’m surprised we haven’t seen a laptop with a flash memory hard
drive yet. Given the significant power, heat and performance
advantage of flash memory over hard drives, I would have expected
the laptop companies to have high-end laptops with flash memory hard
drives by now. I’m probably getting a new laptop in the next six
months, but I’d hold out until the end of the year if it meant being
able to get one with a flash memory hard drive.</li>
<li>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/10/morning-coffee-7/">wrote last
month</a> that
“The next new language I learn will be
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">F#</a>“. I was
wrong. It’s
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">PowerShell</a>.</li>
<li>I’ve been listening to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott</a> gush
about
<a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/CodeRush/">CodeRush</a>
for years now. His <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FreeRefactorForASPNETSoftwareFromTheMakersOfCodeRush.aspx">post
yesterday</a>
about the new free version of Refactor! for ASP.NET finally kicked
me into action. I installed the CodeRush trial and will be commence
bugging my boss to buy it.</li>
<li>Looks like <a href="http://www.identityblog.com/?p=668">big news brewing</a> in
the online identity space.</li>
<li>Dale is <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!335.entry">talking about service
heartbeats</a>.
I’m pretty stoked that Dale is now spending 100% of his work time
(when he’s not blogging about sports, politics or video games
anyway) with me building service oriented infrastructure for MSIT.</li>
