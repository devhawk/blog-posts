<p><a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/jezell/">Jesse</a> is working on a <a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/jezell/posts/6985.aspx">bug tracking
system</a> in 100% managed
code. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/">Scott</a> has posted an awesome
article on the <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/stories/2003/05/13/theMythOfnetPurity.html">Myth of .NET
Purity</a>.
Given that I agree with Scott, you might think I’d disagree with Jesse
avoiding other system on the basis that they “aren’t .NET based”.
However, Jesse isn’t just building a stand alone system – it’s
integrated with
<a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/jezell/posts/7009.aspx">VS.NET</a>. Also, the way
you can build bug tracking directly into your production app is very
cool. I wonder if Jesse is inspired at all by “<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/DBGrm.asp">Production Debugging for
.NET
Applications</a>“.</p>
<p>I’m interested in Jesse’s system because of these features. The whole
100% managed code thing is nice, but as an end user of the system, I
just want it to work.</p>
<p>Jesse – you’re building in support for web services as well, right?</p>
