[Jesse](http://dotnetweblogs.com/jezell/) is working on a [bug tracking
system](http://dotnetweblogs.com/jezell/posts/6985.aspx) in 100% managed
code. [Scott](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/) has posted an awesome
article on the [Myth of .NET
Purity](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/stories/2003/05/13/theMythOfnetPurity.html).
Given that I agree with Scott, you might think I’d disagree with Jesse
avoiding other system on the basis that they “aren’t .NET based”.
However, Jesse isn’t just building a stand alone system – it’s
integrated with
[VS.NET](http://dotnetweblogs.com/jezell/posts/7009.aspx). Also, the way
you can build bug tracking directly into your production app is very
cool. I wonder if Jesse is inspired at all by “[Production Debugging for
.NET
Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/DBGrm.asp)“.

I’m interested in Jesse’s system because of these features. The whole
100% managed code thing is nice, but as an end user of the system, I
just want it to work.

Jesse – you’re building in support for web services as well, right?
