With the launch of VS.NET 2003, there’s a bunch of new architecture
information from Microsoft. A whole new [Pattern
Repository](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/type/Patterns/default.asp)
site is up, featuring patterns for [web
presentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/type/patterns/03/),
[deployment](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/type/patterns/04/),
[distributed
systems](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/type/patterns/05/) and
[performance and
reliability](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/type/patterns/07/). All
of the patterns have communities – check out the [Community Resources
for Architecture and
Design](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/architecture/) on GotDotNet,
including areas on [Enterprise
Architecture](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/architecture/Enterprise/),
[Application
Architecture](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/architecture/Application),
[Systems
Architecture](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/architecture/Systems) and
[Patterns and
Templates](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/architecture/Patterns). Tools
like a [TDL Policy
Editor](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/newsitem.aspx?id=dba1898c-8ac0-4516-98d4-7a7b811e0b75&newsId=635)
