Iâ€™m on vacation this week, but I wanted to quickly point out that we
shipped [IronPython
v2.0.1](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=12481)
last Friday. This has been a performance focused release, as you can see
via our [2.0 vs. 2.0.1
benchmarks](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Wiki/View.aspx?title=IP201VsIP20Perf).
We have improved our PyStone performance by about 11.5% and our Richards
performance by just over 4%. Thanks to
[Dino](http://blogs.msdn.com/dinoviehland/) for the perf improvements
and [Dave](http://knowbody.livejournal.com/) for the great performance
report.
