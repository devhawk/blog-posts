<p>Iâ€™m on vacation this week, but I wanted to quickly point out that we
shipped <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=12481">IronPython
v2.0.1</a>
last Friday. This has been a performance focused release, as you can see
via our <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Wiki/View.aspx?title=IP201VsIP20Perf">2.0 vs. 2.0.1
benchmarks</a>.
We have improved our PyStone performance by about 11.5% and our Richards
performance by just over 4%. Thanks to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dinoviehland/">Dino</a> for the perf improvements
and <a href="http://knowbody.livejournal.com/">Dave</a> for the great performance
report.</p>
