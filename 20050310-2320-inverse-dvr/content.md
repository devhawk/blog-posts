Usually you use your DVR to watch the show and skip the commercials.
Today, however, I did the opposite. Used the DVR to blow thru 58 minutes
of The OC to catch the new [Star Wars Episode
III](http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/) trailer. Pretty cool stuff.
As an added bouns, they also had the trailer for [Sin
City](http://www.sincitythemovie.com/). I didnâ€™t realize Robert
Rodriguez was directing.
