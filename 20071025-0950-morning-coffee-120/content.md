-   Doing these morning coffee posts is a lot tougher since I cut back
    my blog reading. Where I used to have no trouble finding 4-5
    coffee-worthy items every day, these days I seem to only get 1-2, if
    that.
-   After starting off 3-0 and 100% on the PK, the Caps dropped four in
    a row and have been miserable on special teams. The special teams
    woes continued [last night against the
    Lightning](http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20072008/GS020126.HTM),
    but they still won. Caps went 0-4 on the powerplay, and coughed up a
    short handed goal. But they also went 3-3 on the PK, so I guess it
    wasn’t all bad. Maybe my mother will stop calling for Hanlon’s job
    now. It’s a long season and as Peerless Prognosticator points out,
    [the rebuild isn’t
    over](http://peerlessprognosticator.blogspot.com/2007/10/rebuild-is-not-over.html).
-   Jomo Fisher, who helped Scott Hanselman [auto-merge
    assemblies](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MixingLanguagesInASingleAssemblyInVisualStudioSeamlesslyWithILMergeAndMSBuild.aspx),
    has been [digging around in
    F\#](http://blogs.msdn.com/jomo_fisher/archive/tags/F_2300_/default.aspx)
    of late. As it turns out, he’s [joining the F\#
    team](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/17/s-somasegar-on-taking-f-forward.aspx)
    so I’m thinking it’s not a huge stretch for him. If you’re a C\#
    developer trying interested in getting a handle on this new F\#
    thing, his blog is a good place to start.
-   Speaking of F\#, Don Syme posts about yet another new F\# feature:
    [Async
    Workflows](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/11/introducing-f-asynchronous-workflows.aspx).
    Workflow is a bad term here IMO since it can be easily confused with
    [WF](http://wf.netfx3.com/). Regardless of it’s name, Async
    Workflows is about making [.NET’s Async Programming
    model](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228969.aspx) a
    first class citizen in F\#. Robert Pickering has a good post
    [explaining](http://strangelights.com/blog/archive/2007/10/15/1599.aspx)
    how this new feature works.
-   Microsoft sure has a lot of multi-threading / async-programming
    tools coming out. In addition to F\# Async Workflows, there’s the
    [Concurrency and Coordination
    Runtime](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb905422.aspx),
    [Parallel
    LINQ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/10/PLINQ/default.aspx)
    and the [Task Parallel
    Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/10/Futures/default.aspx).
    I would hope all this work eventually coalesces as a coherent
    product offering.
-   Now that F\# is [being
    “producized”](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/17/f-a-functional-programming-language.aspx),
    I wonder if the language evolution will slow down. Async workflows
    were introduced in F\# 1.9.2.9. Other recent changes include
    [Computation
    Expressions](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/09/22/some-details-on-f-computation-expressions-aka-monadic-or-workflow-syntax.aspx)
    (v1.9.2), [Use
    Bindings](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/08/01/introducing-use-bindings-in-f-1-9-2.aspx)
    (v1.9.2) and [Active
    Patterns](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/04/07/draft-paper-on-f-active-patterns.aspx)
    (v1.9.1). F\# seems to churn more in minor releases than C\# does in
    major releases. Of course, that’s because F\# was a research
    project, not a “real” product. Now that it’s going to be a product,
    will the rate of innovation slow?
