<li>My brother is a VaTech alumni, so the shock of the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18134671/">deadly shootings
there yesterday</a> hits very
close to home. My heavy heart is with the grieving Hokie nation
today.</li>
<li>Jeff Atwood has a couple of

on Language vs. Platform. Earlier in my MSFT career, I spent a
significant amount of time explaining .NET, often to companies that
had made a significant investment in Java. Picking the Java platform
is fine (it’s almost the best platform around!), but it seemed many
people I spoke to didn’t understand the fact that “[w]hen you choose
a language, like it or not, you’ve chosen a <em>platform</em>“.</li>

I like Ian’s thinking about SaaS as an analogy for SOA adoption – if
for no other reason that SaaS is easier to “get”. But trying to
realize SOA via SaaS inside the enterprise is a mistake in my
opinion (and I think Ian would agree with that). SaaS is a business
model, and I don’t think you want to turn your enterprise into an
internal service marketplace. Instead, this ties back with Nick
Malik’s points about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/04/14/is-central-planning-impossible.aspx">central
planning</a>. Regardless
if I’m right or wrong, I

<li>TLA Watch: Oracle coins Application Integration Architecture (aka

it</a> “Big SOA”. Isn’t
this the market segment that BizTalk has been in for seven years?</li>
