<p>First, Amigo Grady Booch admits to <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/11/07/grady-booch-sez-throw-models-away/">throwing away
models</a>.
Now, Amigo <a href="http://www.ivarjacobson.com">Ivar Jacobson</a> has signed on as
a VSIP partner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft has tapped Ivar Jacobson, known as one of the fathers of the
popular Rational Unified Process (RUP), to lead an effort to deliver a
lightweight unified process to the Microsoft Solutions Framework.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>Jacobson said the first fruits of his company’s relationship with
Microsoft will be through the delivery of the Essential Unified
Process (Essential UP), which is based on the Microsoft Solutions
Framework and integrated with VSTS.</p>
<p>In short, Essential UP is a simplified or lighter-weight alternative
to RUP, Jacobson said. Essential UP is an evolution of the unified
process Jacobson helped create more than 10 years ago that forms the
foundation of RUP, he said.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>“We need more lightweight processes,” Jacobson said, noting that RUP
has become too heavyweight and cumbersome. “We have competition from
India, China and the former Soviet Union,” he said. “It is not enough
to be agile.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Microsoft has done a good job with its Microsoft Solutions
Framework, and “their process agility is a clear differentiator for
them,” Jacobson said.</p>
<p>“Essential UP stands on all the experience we have from RUP, but also
offers us a chance to have a fresh start,” Jacobson said. “We start in
a new way because we’ve learned what works and what doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>“RUP has a lot of good stuff, but it needs a correction,” [Jacobson]
said.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>However, among the primary problems Jacobson said he has with RUP is
that it is “heavyweight.”</p>
<p>Also, “the process architecture needs to be refactored,” Jacobson
said. “It is very difficult to add new practices because it will force
a big change in the base. For instance, adding in a streamlined way
practices such as EA [Enterprise Architect], SOA [service-oriented
architecture], ABD [asset-based development], re-engineering legacy
systems and commercial off-the-shelf software would be very difficult,
if at all possible. So I believe in starting all over fresh but not
throwing away anything that is good.”</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>“Having an industry luminary build the next version of his tool for
our platform is huge for us,” [VSTS General Manager Rick] LaPlante
said.</p>

<p>I’d like to nominate Rick’s comment for understatement of the year
awards. It also gets me wondering what Amigo Jim Rumbaugh is up to these
days.</p>
