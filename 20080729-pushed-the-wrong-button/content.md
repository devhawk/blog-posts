I’m working on a new series of posts on parser monads, but I
accidentally pushed out part thre (I hit “Publish” instead of “New” in
WL Writer). I can’t stop you from reading it, as it’s already in Google
and FeedBurner’s cache. However, if you want any context at all, do
yourself a favor and wait until I publish parts one and two first!
