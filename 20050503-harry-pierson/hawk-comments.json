    "content": "HHHuuummm......\n\nThis sounds a paraphrasing of my favorite \"workplace vindictive\":\n\n\"Cluelessness\":  There are no stupid questions.  But there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.\n\nliberlly stolen from my favorite \"workplace attitude adjustment\" website:  www.despair.com  (specifically the \"workplace motivator\" poster at http://www.despair.com/cluelessness.html)\n\n(My second favorite?  Dilbert's website of course!)\n\nI buy the Despair calender each year for my zoo cell...er, cubicle, and I've got a stack of \"cluelessness\" sticky-notes on my desk ready to write prescriptions for anyone with this affliction...  (Usually, it's a URL, like where to go to get \"some stuff\" on that Windows operatin' system, msdn.microsoft.com.  DDDUUUUHHHHHH.........)\n\nThe hilarious thing about despair.com is that I actually know more than one guy who's lost their job here in Sillycon Valley due to plastering their cubicles with these $15 posters...only to find out how severly humor-impaired some bigwig was...\n\nI just tell them, \"You don't REALLY want to work for those kind of jerks, now DO YOU?!?!\"\n\nOh, your QOTD would CERTAINLY qualify as a good example of a \"disrespectful\" workplace technique...according to the \"Respect in the Workplace\" mandatory class I had to attend this week.  The mere act of \"mocking\" someone would get you some demerits or a paddlin' out back...\n\nKeep up the good work!  (And visit Despair.com for more ammo to use against the clueless and other branches of the Homo Stupidien tree of life...)\n"
