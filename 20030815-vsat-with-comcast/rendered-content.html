<p>I just got a phone call from my high-speed internet provider
<a href="http://comcast.net/comcast.html">Comcast</a>. It was an automated message,
which I typically have little patience for. However, this message
directed me to a <a href="http://online.comcast.net/help/faq-detail.asp?intFaqID=334">page on their
site</a> that
explains how to deal with MSBlast, including links to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-026.asp">the
patch</a>
and <a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/FixBlast.exe">Symantec’s fix
tool</a>.
Between this and their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/tv/MSTVComcastpr.mspx">adoption of the MS TV
software</a>, I think it’s
safe to say I’m very satisfied with their service.</p>
