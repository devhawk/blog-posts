on corporate blogging, responding to <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/06/27#1182927600">comments on the
subject</a> from
Penny Arcade. Andre “Ozymandias” Vrignaud <a href="http://ozymandias.com/archive/2007/06/27/Penny-Arcade-on-Microsoft-Bloggers.aspx">also
responds</a>.
David is specifically talking about blogging within the gaming
division, but they apply pretty broadly to Microsoft as a whole when
it comes to blogging. “I don’t want to get fired”, “I don’t want to
do things that needlessly hurt my company” and “We can say things
that PR or marketing people can’t.  Or won’t.” all ring true to me.</li>
<li>Speaking of gaming, there seems to be more that your average cool
games coming our for Xbox 360 this summer. I just picked up Forza 2
which rocks with the Racing Wheel. <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/thedarkness/">The
Darkness</a> looks very cool
and I laughed my ass off playing the
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/overlord">Overlord</a> demo. Both shipped
this week and have gotten <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/xbox360/">good
reviews</a>. On their way in
August are <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bioshock/">Bioshock</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bluedragonxbox360/">Blue
Dragon</a>. Of course,
there are a
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/grandtheftautoiv/">few</a>
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/assassinscreed/">other</a>
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/halo3">big</a>
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect/">games</a>
coming this holiday. A good, but expensive, year to be a gamer.</li>
<li>I laughed my ass off reading Larry O’Brien’s <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,0447726e-8ac1-46b2-8cf5-22afb7eb3cc5.aspx">Top 10 Things To Do
With Your Petaflop

<li>WSDL 2.0, it’s official. Nick Allen has the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/06/28/wsdl-2-0-completed.aspx">news</a>.
Personally, WSDL seems to be the spec most responsible for driving
RPC-style request/response web services, so let’s just say that I am
not a fan.  </li>
<li>Joe McKendrick
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=905">thinks</a> <em>something</em>
is “holding back SOA”? I don’t think it’s any one thing, but
certainly the RPC style that most web service toolkits pretty much
force down your throat isn’t helping.</li>
<li>Nick Malik
<a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/06/27/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions/">thinks</a><a href="http://windowsclient.net/acropolis/">Acropolis</a>
is promising as a SOA service consumer, but Udi Dalan
<a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/06/27/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions/http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/06/27/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions/">thinks</a>
it doesn’t support multi-threading well enough. I lean towards Nick
on this one since I see multi-threading as a language problem, which
a library like Acropolis can’t solve on it’s own.</li>
<li>Jon Flanders <a href="http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon/PermaLink,guid,01a499d4-9aa3-4902-bafd-fae03cb89d13.aspx">has been
busy</a>
building the <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=437">BizTalk Server 2006 extensions for Windows Workflow
Foundation (June CTP) SDK
Sample</a>.
I’m not sure why the marketing folks gave this such a long and
involved name, but the sample does look pretty cool. Paul Andrews
has the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2007/06/04/biztalk-adapter-for-windows-workflow-foundation-sample-june-2007-ctp.aspx">project
overview</a>
and <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=6902574">demo video</a>. However,
given that the WF workflows are hosted in BTS, is it accurate to say
“<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2007/06/27/no-biztalk-experience-required.aspx">No Biztalk Experience
Required</a>“?</li>
<li>Speaking of WF, Tomas Restrepo <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/06/28/WorkflowServicesInOrcas.aspx">takes a detailed
look</a>
at the new WF service hosting in .NET FX 3.5. Mostly, he likes what
he sees. I have the same problem he does with the message
correlation IDs. I’d like to have other options here, including
support for what I call “message data correlation” (Tomas describes
this as “natural correlating identifiers”) and “address correlation”
which is basically the REST model.</li>
