<p>I saw a
<a href="http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=30623">post</a> on
<a href="http://www.theserverside.net/">TSS.NET</a> pointing to the Outlook 2003
Integration APIs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft has released former “internal only” APIs for developing
applications that work with Microsoft Outlook. The APIs include
account management, connection state, free/busy, MAPI-MIME conversion,
and the Outlook store.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea why these APIs have been released at this time, but
providing more options/control/tools to developers is better than less –
along the same lines of the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/12/13/member-management-component-prototype/">ASP.NET 1.1 Membership
Prototype</a>.</p>
<p>My only issue is that not all the APIs are documented. For example,
recently I was interested in being able to progammatically set Outlook’s
online/offline status. When I read the post above, I thought the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/olintapi/html/oliaAbouttheConnectionStateManagementAPI_HV01155189.asp">Connection State
API</a>
would be the answer. Alas, that API can only be used to get notification
when the connection state changes. Or, at least, that’s all that’s
documented: the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/olintapi/html/oliaIMAPIOfflineMgr_HV01156488.asp">IMAPIOfflineMgr
interface</a>
has seven undocumented methods and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/olintapi/html/oliaIMAPIOffline_HV01156492.asp">IMAPIOffline
interface</a>
has two. I’m sure there’s a good reason those others aren’t documented,
but it’s frustrating all the same.</p>
<p>Of course, even with the ommisions, that’s a lot of cool stuff to add to
