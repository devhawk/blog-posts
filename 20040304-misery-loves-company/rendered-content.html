<p>Fellow ‘softie and Washington Caps fan <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/">Dan
Fernandez</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/03/01/82415.aspx">feels my
pain</a>. I
called my father the other day and chirped: “Any new ex-Caps today?” and
was very depressed to hear “Yeah, Gonchar’s gone”. I know I SAID my
favorite Caps were on one way tickets out of town, but it’s depressing
to be right. Between the fire sale and the upcoming CBA quagmire, I
wonder if the Caps will sell ANY season tickets for next year.</p>
<p>I have a coworker who used to work for AOL in general and Ted “Hockey
Abomination” Leonsis in particular. He’s watched a game from the owner
box. I told him to give Ted a message for me : “Sell the Team”. Of
course, I’m guessing he’s hearing that message on several fronts these
days.</p>

<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/02/82721.aspx">enjoyed</a>
a Seattle Thunderbirds game recently. Also, the annual <a href="http://www.seattlethunderbirds.com/events/mshc.html">Microsoft Hockey
Challenge</a> is next
weekend. Traditionally, we played rival IT companies like Sun and AOL,
thrashing them soundly on the ice (the one time I went, we been Sun
8-1). <a href="http://www.seattlethunderbirds.com/events/mshc.html#sched">This
year</a>, there
are a variety of intra-MSFT games and a series of MSFT vs. Customer
games, but no industry rivalry games. Bummer!</p>
