<p>I think one of the reasons that the RPC model still dominates many
people’s thinking is that we really haven’t gone beyond the HTTP
binding defined in the first SOAP spec. For better or worse, as long
as we are focused on a client-initiated request/response model,
developers are going to think of it as RPC (even though HTTP deals in
streamed bytes, not callstacks). WS-Addressing opens the door to other
possibilities – like sending response messages to places other than
the implicit port at the other end of the HTTP connection.</p>
<p>With a standard way to describe where messages are supposed to go,
what their intent is, and how they relate to one another, we can start
building systems that use SOAP messages in other ways (without the
complexities of WS-Routings message paths). That in turn will start to
influence WSDL. In short, WS-Addressing may be the forcing function we
need to really start moving away from the the current RPC-centric view
of the world into more interesting areas.<br />

<p>I’ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/01/20/wsdl-soapaction-issues/">expressed my
frustration</a>
with WSDL’s special treatment of HTTP with regard to the Action
attribute before. If
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-addressing.asp">WS-Addressing</a>
can help move WSDL in the right direction, I’m all for it.</p>
<p>My only concern is that there seems to be a lot of overlap with
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-routing.asp">WS-Routing</a>.
Both specs define an Action element that corresponds to the WSDL
soapAction attribute. Both specs define Message ID and RelatesTo
elements. Both specs define from and to addresses, though WS-Routing’s
message paths are much more flexible (and complex). Does WS-Addressing
imply WS-Routing is in for a major change?</p>
