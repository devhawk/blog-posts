    "content": "Hi,\n\nIn my opinion VS integration is, indeed, more important then Python 3.x. \n\nIf the model of choice for this integration is a VS Addin, maybe you could release a CTP with some of the features, even if it doesn't include a decent intellisense.\n\nMy company is considering moving a code generator written in Delphi Win32 to a VS Addin, embedding IronPython in it, using it to run the Models (somewhat like CodeSmith, but much more specific).\n\nThe problem is that VS doesn't even have syntax highlighting. \n\nThanks.
