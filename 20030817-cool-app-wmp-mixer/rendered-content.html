<p><a href="http://erablog.net/blogs/sean/">Sean Alexander</a> had a link to <a href="http://www.wmplugins.com/ItemDetail.aspx?ItemID=335">WMP
Mixer</a> Friday. This
is a cool app that lets you have two media streams and mix between them
DJ style.</p>
<p>I used to DJ back in college for the campus radio station. We had a
remote kit so we could spin tunes for frat parties. Typically, my job at
these remotes was to lug heavy DJ equipment, but I did occasionally spin
at parties. The one thing WMP Mixer is missing is the ability to preview
the next song while the current song is playing. Of course, you’d need
more than the standard single audio out that most PCs have these days. I
have a <a href="http://us.hercules.com/products/showpage.php?p=56&amp;b=0&amp;f=1">5.1 sound
card</a> that I
bought for my Media Center and haven’t installed. I wonder if you could
play media streams to separate channels (rear speakers could be used for
preview). I’m curious if different instances of WMP will let you drive
different sound card outputs. I’m guessing no, since I can’t seem to
find an option to change the sound output of WMP.</p>
