    "content": "Mr Pierson,\n\nI found your blog through our referral logs. Actually, GOL-IN does have its own RSS feed. On our homepage (http://governments-online.org), scroll down and you'll find the little orange button at the bottom (it's been there since early 2002!)\n\nGOL-IN is a network for government officials working with e-government. Admittedly, our site (and hence our feed) is not very active nor informative; most of our work is \"back-channeling\"."
