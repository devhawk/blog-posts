I was talking about modeling with [Michael
Lehman](http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman) today when he mentioned the
“cult of the arcane” – people who specialize in typically older
technologies that are not widely understood who use this general lack of
knowledge for job security. I thought it was funny.
