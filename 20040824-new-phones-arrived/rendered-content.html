<p>I got my twin V300′s tonight. No sweat – only issue was figuring out
which one was mine and which one was <a href="http://techiewife.com/">Julie’s</a>
(We don’t have exactly the same plans). Of course, they look identical.
We’ve set the backgrounds to different images so we can tell by opening
the phone who’s it is, but it would be really nice to have a different
faceplate for at least one of them. Plus we need 2 car chargers and I’d
like to get a data cable to sync my contact list.
<a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a> has a bunch of vendors like
<a href="http://stores.ebay.com/PhoneStations">PhoneStations</a> that offer these
accessories cheap – <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=35189&amp;item=3065020134">car
charger</a>
for 99 cents,
<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=35215&amp;item=5701226071">faceplate</a>
for $2.97, <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=35209&amp;item=3088661486">data
cable</a>
for $14.99. S&amp;H is a little outragous – $15 for four items – but $35
total including S&amp;H seems way reasonable, esp. when T-Mobile
<a href="http://www.tmobile.com/products/accessories/list.asp?phoneid=201260&amp;devicename=Motorola%20V300">charges</a>
$35 for just the data cable. Anyone know anything about places to buy
V300 accessories? What about applications for the V300? The data cable
doesn’t come w/ any software. I found
<a href="http://motocoder.com/">MotoCoder</a>, but I don’t really have time to
write my own apps for this phone (esp. in J2ME).</p>
