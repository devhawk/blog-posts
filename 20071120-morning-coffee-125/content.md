-   So I wasn’t quite as close to the end of [Dead
    Rising](http://www.xbox.com/games/deadrising/) as I thought I was.
    Those who’ve played the game thru will understand.
-   After their promising start, the Capitals [lost yet
    again](http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=271119023). At the
    20 game point, they’re now 6-13-1 for a league-worst 13 points. I
    think we’re at the point where they need to fire [Glen
    Hanlon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Hanlon). Nothing personal
    Glen, but it’s not getting done. The only problem is who you would
    replace him with? [Bob
    Hartley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hartley)? Uh, no thanks. I
    think most Caps fans want [Dale
    Hunter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Hunter), but I think he’s
    [too
    involved](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Knights#The_Hunter_Era.2C_2000-Present)
    with the [London
    Knights](http://www.ontariohockeyleague.com/stats/roster.php?team_id=14&season_id=32)
    – he’s co-owner, president and head coach. But if we could get Dale,
    I’m guessing Glen would be gone in a heartbeat.
-   The XNA team blog
    [announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/11/19/now-available-xna-game-studio-2-0-beta.aspx)
    that XNA Game Studio 2.0′s beta has released. The
    [download](http://creators.xna.com/beta/betahome.aspx) is available
    from Creators Club Online. The big new feature in this release is
    network support, and they’ve shipped a new [starter
    kit](http://creators.xna.com/beta/NetRumbleWindows.vsi) to get you
    started.
-   In addition to shipping VS08 & .NET FX 3.5, a new [CTP of SQL
    2008](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=3BF4C5CA-B905-4EBC-8901-1D4C1D1DA884&displaylang=en)
    shipped yesterday. I couldn’t find a good overview of what’s new,
    but the SQL Express team has a [post on what’s
    new](http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlexpress/archive/2007/11/19/what-s-new-in-sql-express-2008-november-ctp.aspx)
    in just their corner of this release. (via [Jesus
    Rodriguez](http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/11/20/vs-2008-net-fx-3-5-and-sql-server-2008-ctp-are-here.aspx))
-   In more “I know it’s Thanksgiving week, but we’re shipping anyway”
    news, the
    [Ruby.NET](http://rubydotnet.googlegroups.com/web/Home.htm) folks
    have shipped v0.9 – the first release since transferring control to
    the community. Does it run Rails? Not yet, but
    [apparently](http://rubydotnet.googlegroups.com/web/PastPresentFuture.htm#Current)
    they’re “close to getting Ruby on Rails to run successfully”. One
    thing that caught my eye is that it includes [VS
    integration](http://rubydotnet.googlegroups.com/web/VisualStudioIntegration.htm).
    Nice.
