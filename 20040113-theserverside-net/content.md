The [Middleware Company](http://www.middleware-company.com/) has
launched [TheServerSide .NET](http://www.theserverside.net/), a
community for enterprise .NET development. Of course, it’s a complement
to their existing enterprise Java site simply called
[TheServerSide](http://www.theserverside.com/). Generally, [the
reaction](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.jsp?thread_id=23253)
on TheServerSide to the new .NET site is positive – only one negative
comment as I blog this.

Various teams at Microsoft are contributing content. There’s a smart
client [case
study](http://www.theserverside.net/studies/study.aspx?l=ThomsonOne)
from a project my by team. Patterns and Practices have a [public book
review](http://www.theserverside.net/booksinreview/pag.aspx). And there
are [tech talks](http://www.theserverside.net/talks/index.aspx) from Don
Box and Scott Guthrie. Look for more in the future.

Other great content on the site includes an [article on unit
testing](http://www.theserverside.net/articles/article.aspx?l=UnitTesting),
a [tech
talk](http://www.theserverside.net/talks/library.aspx#NatarajanJaneva)
from a Borland engineer and an [article on autonomous
services](http://www.theserverside.net/articles/article.aspx?l=AutonomousServices).

Major congrats to Floyd Marinescu (GM of Server Side Communities) and
[Ted
Neward](http://www.theserverside.net/articles/article.aspx?l=Welcome)
(Editor in Chief of TSS.NET). Looks like it’s going to be a great site –
though the sign up process seems to have a few bugs in it this morning.
