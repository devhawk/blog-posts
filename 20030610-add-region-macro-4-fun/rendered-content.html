<p>I just got a chance to check out the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun05302003.asp">latest Coding4Fun
article</a>
on MSDN. The article is about writing macros for VS.NET and one of the
examples in the article shows how to build a macro to insert regions
into your code by selection. What a great idea! Why didn’t I think of
that? 😉</p>
<p>Seriously, thanks <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma">Duncan</a> for the link
to my <a href="art_addregion.aspx">region insertion macro</a> and for calling it
“much more detailed”. It wouldn’t be without Richard Childress, John St.
Clair, <a href="http://www.hanoulle.be/">Yves Hanoulle</a> and <a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/TWalters/">Tim
Walters</a> who contributed bug fixes,
support for VB.NET and undo contexts.</p>
