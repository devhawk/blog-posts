As a new dad, I’ve got the requisite [digital
camera](http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_product_lobbypage.asp?l=1&p=16&bc=2&product=868)
and [digital camcorder](http://www.canondv.com/archive/zr20/index.html).
So I’ve taken a ton of photos and shot some video, which I
[share](http://groups.msn.com/HarryPiersonPhotos/patrickharoldpierson.msnw)[online](http://groups.msn.com/HarryPiersonPhotos/homemovies.msnw).
But it’s nice to have physical copies of the photos for albums, so I
bought a new [HP 5550
DeskJet](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/un/WF05/18972-236251-236261-14438-71895.html)
printer. I also sprung for the high quality photo paper and the [Photo
InkJet
Cartridge](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/un/WF08/18972-236251-236261-14438-71895.html#IDAY2CGB)
that turns the 4 color printer into a 6 color photo printer. This
printer was the [PC Magazine’s Editor’s
Choice](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,581924,00.asp), and after
seeing the output, I completely agree. I used to do photo touchup and
color correction for a publishing company, and this printer completely
blows me away.

Now all I need is a DVD burner to go with my firewire card, 80GB hard
drive and [Windows Movie
Maker](http://www.microsoft.com/WindowsXP/moviemaker/default.asp).
