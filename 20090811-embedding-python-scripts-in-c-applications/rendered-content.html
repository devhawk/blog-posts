<p>Now that I’ve got Pygments and its dependencies <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/08/10/compiling-python-packages-into-assemblies/">packaged up in an
easy-to-distribute
assembly</a>,
I need to be able to call it from C#. However, if you pop open
pygments.dll in Reflector, you’ll notice it’s not exactly intuitive to
access. Lots of compiler generated names like pygments$12 and
StringIO$64 in a type named DLRCachedCode. Clearly, this code isn’t
intended to be used by anything except the IronPython runtime.</p>
<p>So we better create one of those IronPython runtime thingies.</p>
<p>As you can see in the layer diagram to the left, PygmentsCodeSource is
split into two parts – a C# part and a Python part. The Python part is
very simple – just importing a couple of Pygments functions into the
global namespace and a simple helper function to generate syntax
highlighted HTML from a given block of code in a given language and
style. The code itself is pretty simple. Note the reference to the
pygments assembly I described last post. Here’s the entire file:</p>
<div class="lang-python editor-colors">import clr
clr.AddReference("pygments")

from pygments.lexers import get_all_lexers
from pygments.styles import get_all_styles

def generate_html(code, lexer_name, style_name):
  from pygments import highlight
  from pygments.lexers import get_lexer_by_name
  from pygments.styles import get_style_by_name
  from devhawk_formatter import DevHawkHtmlFormatter

  if not lexer_name: lexer_name = "text"
  if not style_name: style_name = "default"
  lexer = get_lexer_by_name(lexer_name)
  return highlight(code, lexer, DevHawkHtmlFormatter(style=style_name))

</div>
<p>Instead of including this in the Pygments assembly, I embedded this file
as a resource in my C# assembly. This way, I could use the standard DLR
hosting APIs to create a script source and execute this code. I did have
to build a concrete StreamContentProvider class to wrap the resource
stream in, but otherwise, it’s pretty straight forward.</p>
<div class="lang-csharp editor-colors"><div style="color:Black;background-color:White;"><pre>
<span style="color:Blue;">static</span> ScriptEngine _engine;
<span style="color:Blue;">static</span> ScriptSource _source;

<span style="color:Blue;">private</span> <span style="color:Blue;">void</span> InitializeHosting()
{
    _engine = IronPython.Hosting.Python.CreateEngine();

    <span style="color:Blue;">var</span> asm = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
    <span style="color:Blue;">var</span> stream = asm.GetManifestResourceStream(
                   <span style="color:#A31515;">&quot;DevHawk.PygmentsCodeSource.py&quot;</span>);
    _source = _engine.CreateScriptSource(
                <span style="color:Blue;">new</span> BasicStreamContentProvider(stream),  
                <span style="color:#A31515;">&quot;PygmentsCodeSource.py&quot;</span>);
}

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once I got the engine and script source set up, all that remains is
setup a script scope to execute the script source in. For this specific
application, it’s probably overkill to have a scope per instance – I
think the syntax highlighting process is stateless so a single scope
should be easily shared across multiple PygmentsCodeSource instances.
But I didn’t take any chances, I created a script scope per instance to
execute the source in.</p>
<div class="lang-csharp editor-colors"><div style="color:Black;background-color:White;"><pre>
ScriptScope _scope;
Thread _init_thread;

<span style="color:Blue;">public</span> PygmentsCodeSource()
{
    <span style="color:Blue;">if</span> (_engine == <span style="color:Blue;">null</span>)
        InitializeHosting();

     _scope = _engine.CreateScope();

    _init_thread = <span style="color:Blue;">new</span> Thread(() =&gt; { _source.Execute(_scope); });
    _init_thread.Start();
}

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You’ll notice that I’m executing the source in the scope on a background
thread. That’s because it takes a while to execute, especially the first
time. However, I don’t actually use the Python code until after the user
types or copies a block of code into the UI and presses OK. In my
experience, executing the Python code is typically finished by the time
I get code into the box and press OK. I just need to make sure I add an
_init_thread.Join guard anywhere I’m going to access the _scope to be
sure the initialization is complete before I try to use it.</p>
<p>In the next, and last, post in this small series we’ll see how to invoke
Python functions in the _scope I initialized above from C#.</p>
