    a similar conclusion about Silverlight and Apollo [that I
    did](http://devhawk.net/2007/05/02/hawkeye-on-silverlight/). But
    [newly minted](http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/?p=816) Adobe RIA
    evangelist Ryan Stewart
    [writes](http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/?p=823) that calling
    Silverlight vs. Apollo the next platform competition is overblown.
    However, he then reiterates my point that MSFT is moving in on
    Adobe’s traditional stronghold (aka the web) while Adobe is moving
    in on MSFT’s traditional stronghold (aka the desktop). The upshot is
    that both companies are trying to deliver a unified “client”
    platform that spans desktop, devices and browser. That sounds like
    “platform competition” to me.
-   Apparently I’m missing the this years compiler dev lab.
    :frowning:
    John Lam [is
    there](http://www.iunknown.com/2007/05/compiler_dev_la.html), with
    [slides from his
    talk](http://www.iunknown.com/files/dlr_experiences.pdf) on the DLR.
    Miguel de Icaza is
    [there](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-17.html), with
    [fairly](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-17.html)
    [extensive](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-23.html)
    notes. Hopefully they will post talks like they did [last
    year](http://www.langnetsymposium.com/speakers.asp).
-   Speaking of languages, Scott Hanselman
    [explains](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProgrammerIntentOrWhatYoureNotGettingAboutRubyAndWhyItsTheTits.aspx)
    why he thinks Ruby is “the tits”. Personally, on the scale between
    “I can’t see where Ruby is such hot shit” and “Ruby is the tits”,
    I’m somewhere near the middle, leaning towards tits. I love the
    expressiveness of Ruby’s syntax, but I miss the static typing. Call
    me [over the hill](http://devhawk.net/2007/05/21/im-37/), but I
    like the compiler catching mistakes at compile time. I realize it’s
    not for everyone, but I like what I like.
-   This talk about Ruby’s expressiveness reminds me of something Larry
    O’Brien
    [said](http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,a3baaf7a-1af3-460a-8486-6b459dab51ed.aspx)
    in the wake of the IronRuby announcement: “I *am* surprised by the
    IronRuby announcement. I really thought we were going to see some
    form of Ruby\#:Ruby::C\#:Java. Although I’m happy, I was actually
    hoping to see a new language.” The expressiveness of Ruby that Scott
    describes (which is to say, not all of Ruby’s expressiveness) would
    be completely achievable in a statically typed language. Personally,
    I’d like to see that language…
