a similar conclusion about Silverlight and Apollo <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/02/hawkeye-on-silverlight/">that I
did</a>. But
<a href="http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/?p=816">newly minted</a> Adobe RIA
evangelist Ryan Stewart
<a href="http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/?p=823">writes</a> that calling
Silverlight vs. Apollo the next platform competition is overblown.
However, he then reiterates my point that MSFT is moving in on
Adobe’s traditional stronghold (aka the web) while Adobe is moving
in on MSFT’s traditional stronghold (aka the desktop). The upshot is
that both companies are trying to deliver a unified “client”
platform that spans desktop, devices and browser. That sounds like
“platform competition” to me.</li>

John Lam <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/05/compiler_dev_la.html">is
there</a>, with
<a href="http://www.iunknown.com/files/dlr_experiences.pdf">slides from his
talk</a> on the DLR.
Miguel de Icaza is
<a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-17.html">there</a>, with

<a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-23.html">extensive</a>
notes. Hopefully they will post talks like they did <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/speakers.asp">last

<li>Speaking of languages, Scott Hanselman
<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/ScottHanselman/%7E3/118922284/ProgrammerIntentOrWhatYoureNotGettingAboutRubyAndWhyItsTheTits.aspx">explains</a>
why he thinks Ruby is “the tits”. Personally, on the scale between
“I can’t see where Ruby is such hot shit” and “Ruby is the tits”,
I’m somewhere near the middle, leaning towards tits. I love the
expressiveness of Ruby’s syntax, but I miss the static typing. Call
me <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/21/im-37/">over the hill</a>, but I
like the compiler catching mistakes at compile time. I realize it’s
not for everyone, but I like what I like.</li>
<li>This talk about Ruby’s expressiveness reminds me of something Larry
O’Brien
<a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,a3baaf7a-1af3-460a-8486-6b459dab51ed.aspx">said</a>
in the wake of the IronRuby announcement: “I <em>am</em> surprised by the
IronRuby announcement. I really thought we were going to see some
form of Ruby#:Ruby::C#:Java. Although I’m happy, I was actually
hoping to see a new language.” The expressiveness of Ruby that Scott
describes (which is to say, not all of Ruby’s expressiveness) would
be completely achievable in a statically typed language. Personally,
I’d like to see that language…</li>
