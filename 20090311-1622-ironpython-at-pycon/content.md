Here’s a quick quiz. Which of these tasks is harder to accomplish:

1.  Getting \$6,000 from a variety of groups within Microsoft to pay for
    a Gold [PyCon 2009](http://us.pycon.org/2009/) sponsorship.
2.  Sending [PSF](http://www.python.org/psf/) a check

If you guessed \#2, you’d be right. It’s amazing how difficult the
seemly trivial task of “give those PSF folks money” turned out to be.
But it’s done now, and you can see the MS logo there on the side of all
the PyCon pages.

In addition to the sponsorship, there are some great looking IronPython
sessions at PyCon.
