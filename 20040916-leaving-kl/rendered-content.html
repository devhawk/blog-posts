<p>I’m sitting in the Kuala Lumpur airport – my flight to Beijing leaves in
about half an hour. I didn’t get a chance to blog all day yesterday, so
here’s a quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve run into a bunch of people who I first met at TechEd Malaysia 2002.
In particular, Adrian and Rathi who both wanted to see
pictures of Patrick. The big bummer of only spending two days here
is that I didn’t get to do much more that the conference.</li>
<li>After the sessions on Wednesday, I hung out with a bunch of the
other speakers at dinner. Several of the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/community/rd/default.aspx">RD’s</a>
who spoke at TechEd US also came to our <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/05/24/teched-days-0-1/">Architect Road
Rally</a>
and had a great time. Always nice to be told you threw a great
party.</li>
<li>Thursday started  with Gurpreet’s session on Architecture Vision &amp;
Direction. I didn’t think this session did as well as the EA talk
the day before. Part of that comes from the fact the EA talk set a
high bar, but some of it comes from the fact that the V&amp;D talk
wasn’t as polished. In contrast, I did much better with my
Metropolis Thursday than the SOA Data talk on Wednesday. Maybe I
just need one talk to get back in the groove – I usually think I do
better in my second session.</li>
<li>After our sessions, lunch, and hanging around in the cabana with
some other attendees, Aaron (the local Architect Evangelist) drove
Gurp and I around
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series/">Putrajaya</a>.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland">Pat</a> often points out when he
presents Metropolis that you can’t bulldoze Boston just because the
roads aren’t straight. However, you can build a new city about a
half an hour away and move into it when it’s finished. That’s
Putrajaya – the new administrative center of Malaysia.  It was
stunning – huge and ultra modern. But it was also strange as it is
completely underutilized, so far anyway. We also did a little
shopping and I was able to find a few things for the family back
home.</li>
<li>Last night we had a regional architect dinner, where we got to hang
out with a bunch of the local architects in the region. Lots of good
discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next stop – China!</p>
