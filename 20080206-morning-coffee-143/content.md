-   I’ve been sick for three days, hence the lack of posting around
    here.
-   As a Redskins fan, it’s hard to root for any other NFC East team. On
    the other hand, it sure was easy to root against the Patriots.
    Congrats to the Giants on their Super Bowl victory. Favorite
    headline: 18 and uh-oh!
-   Sounds like there’s [cause for
    optimism](http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/strike-status-report-everything-i-know-about-where-things-stand/)
    regarding the writer’s strike. But is it already too late? Will the
    [9% drop in viewers](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23018362/) ever
    come back? Personally, I think the studios have hastened their own
    irrelevance.
-   With [last night’s
    win](http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=805&season=20072008&gameType=2),
    the Caps are one game above .500. In and of itself, that’s nothing
    to be proud of – Coach Boudreau remarked when we reached .500 that
    the Caps had “officially reached mediocrity”. However, the Caps are
    the *only* team in the SE conference that’s above .500. If hockey
    used baseball standings, Carolina, Atlanta and Florida would each be
    1/2 game back of the Caps. It’s going to be a fight to the finish.
-   In fairly big managed Ruby news, [Wayne
    Kelly](http://sky.fit.qut.edu.au/~kellyw/) has
    [decided](http://groups.google.com/group/RubyDOTNET/msg/f34570019c391974)
    to contribute to the [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.net/) effort,
    effectively walking away from the
    [Ruby.NET](http://rubydotnet.googlegroups.com/web/Home.htm) which
    helped get off the ground. One the one hand, obviously this is great
    for IronRuby. On the other hand, I liked the idea of multiple
    managed implementations of Ruby, so here’s hoping Ruby.NET doesn’t
    fade away.
-   Speaking of the DLR, I know I mentioned [Martin Maly’s
    blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/mmaly/default.aspx) in my [Lang.NET
    Morning Coffee
    Post](http://devhawk.net/2008/01/31/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx),
    but I didn’t actually get to read his posts on targeting the DLR
    until I unexpectedly had several days off sick. If you are at all
    interested in writing your own language for the .NET platform: [Go.
    Read. Now.](http://blogs.msdn.com/mmaly/default.aspx) You should
    also check out Tomas Restrepo’s blog, he has also started [writing
    about targeting the
    DLR](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2008/02/04/BuildingOnTheDLR.aspx).
-   Larry O’Brien’s blog is currently offline, but he
    [commented](http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,c6364ebf-4345-4475-8882-31646e49b519.aspx)
    that he doubted my
    [ToyScript](http://blogs.msdn.com/mmaly/archive/2008/01/08/building-a-dlr-language-toyscript.aspx)
    F\# parser would be more than 600 lines of code. Currently, the
    parser is clocking in at 287 lines of code plus about 50 more for
    the AST. It’s not done yet – see earlier statement about being sick
    – but I’m fixing bugs not writing additional code at this point. To
    be completely accurate, that’s 287 lines of [FParsec
    code](http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/). It’s taken me a little bit
    to learn FParsec, but so far I’m pretty happy with it.
-   Scott Hanselman [points
    to](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MSDeployNewIISWebDeploymentTool.aspx)
    the new [MS
    Deploy](http://blogs.iis.net/msdeploy/archive/2008/01/22/welcome-to-the-web-deployment-team-blog.aspx)
    project, a tool for managing content and configuration on web
    servers. I’ve never understood why this wasn’t a standard part of
    IIS. It seems every hosting company I’ve used has rolled their own
    web-based management tool like
    [DotNetPanel](http://www.dotnetpanel.com/).
-   Oh yeah, Vista SP1 and Windows Server 2008 [shipped
    Monday](http://blogs.technet.com/windowsserver/archive/2008/02/04/windows-server-2008-rtm.aspx).
    Congrats!
-   I fired up [Inside
    Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/insidexbox/) the other
    day, and there was a page about the new Disney Channel show
    “[Phineas and
    Ferb](http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/phineasandferb/)“. Of
    course, with two kids under five, anything new on the Disney Channel
    is notable in my house. What made this blog-worthy is the fact that
    it’s directed and written by [Dan
    Povenmire](http://imdb.com/name/nm0693933/), who I knew from my USC
    days. I used to go see his band Keep Left and groan loudly at the
    bad puns in their song “PSA”. Dan, if you found this searching for
    yourself online: Awesome work, my kids love the show!
