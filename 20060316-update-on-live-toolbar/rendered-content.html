<p>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/10/hawk-eye-on-live-toolbar-first-run-experience/">wrote last
week</a>
about the need for a better first run expereince for the new <a href="http://toolbar.live.com">Live
Toolbar</a>. I just went to install the toolbar on
my dev partition and lo and behold, the first run experience is fixed!
It now presents a list of installable components with the most popular
ones preselected. Much better.</p>
