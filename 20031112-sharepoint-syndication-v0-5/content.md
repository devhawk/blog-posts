I’ve finally updated the [SharePoint
Syndication](prj_sharepointsynd.aspx) project to support the RTM version
of [Windows SharePoint
Services](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/techinfo/sharepoint/overview.mspx).
Since I’m in process of updating my blog software, I haven’t updated the
project page, though I have updated the [GDN
workspace](http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/spsynd) with the [release
bits](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/viewUploads.aspx?id=bef1fffe-6d20-42c8-a72d-ae7e9a5a194b),
[source
code](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/FileShare.aspx?id=bef1fffe-6d20-42c8-a72d-ae7e9a5a194b)
and [readme
file](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/UploadedHtmlPage.aspx?FileID=059f44fc-31eb-4ca8-8566-bc8f9c8bc8ce&id=bef1fffe-6d20-42c8-a72d-ae7e9a5a194b).
The workspace even has a freshly minted url:
<http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/spsynd>. Enjoy.
