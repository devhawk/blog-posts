<p>For vacation this past week, my family went to Los Angeles to visit
friends and family. We got to see some of my old college friends as well
as Julie’s brother, dad and best friend. We also went by our old
apartment building to see iLia and Elena Anossov, the apartment
managers, as well as their son Phillip. In addition to managing our old
apartment building, they are both artists.
<a href="http://www.truefresco.com/anossov/">Ilia</a> is one of the few fresco
masters living in the US. In addition to his art, he also runs a variety
of online properties dedicated to fresco painting. You can check out
<a href="http://iladesigns.com/">his portfolio</a>, read <a href="http://www.truefresco.com/anossov/bio_anossov.html">his

<p>I’m reading <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0124699/">Jeff’s</a> account of the
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0124699/2003/12/07.html#a31">mural for his
wife</a> with great
interest. I don’t think I want to invest in such a project in my current
house, but in a few years when we move on to something bigger
(hopefully) then I hope I can bring Ilia (and family) up to paint a
fresco mural for my house.</p>
