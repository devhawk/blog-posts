Both [XNA Game Studio Express](http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/XNA/)
and [Microsoft Robotics
Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/robotics/) shipped their 1.0 releases
this week. So once you’re done hacking a robot to mow your lawn, you can
relax by debugging your latest game on your Xbox 360. W00t!

Santa, please bring me a few extra hours per day so I can play with this
stuff!
