<p>It’s been over for a day, and I realize I didn’t blog that much about
PDC. Of course, there are <a href="http://pdcbloggers.net">plenty who did</a>, so
I’ll just add a few thoughts.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who came to the Architecture Symposium. Sorry the
logistics got so screwed up. In retrospect, I’d say the last minute
decision to move us to a smaller room in order to accommodate an Avalon
session repeat was a very bad one. We tried to guess what the attendance
would be. You all really blew away our expectations. I guess there’s a
lot of interest in architecture! I hope this means that you can expect
more architecture themed content (driven by our team) at future MSFT
conferences. The slides from <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/PDC/4284/ARCSYM1.ppt">Pat and
David's talk</a> as
well as <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/PDC/4286/ARCSYM3.ppt">Keith's</a>
are available online. We’ll get streaming media &amp; transcripts on the
architecture as soon as possible, but not until after next week. If you
liked Keith’s talk as much as I did, check out the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/enterprise/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vsent_modelinglangs.asp">Modeling Languages
for Distributed
Applications</a>
whitepaper that’s up on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/enterprise/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vsent_modelinglangs.asp">VS.NET Home for the Enterprise
Customer</a>,
which was launched @ PDC.</p>
<p>Here are a few other random thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Favorite Quote: “If it wasn’t for blogging, I’d be very lonely. I
wouldn’t know anyone here” – <a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/">Werner
Vogel</a></li>
<li>I’m really glad I met <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/">Peter
Provost</a>. We had a great
conversation @ the weblogger’s BOF and I ended hanging out with him
several more times thru the con.</li>
<li>Really sorry I didn’t get to see the opening keynote, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott
Hanselman</a> or <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-10-26T05:37:17Z">Band on the
Runtime</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://pdcbloggers.net">PDC Bloggers</a> rocks. Has the site changed,
or has it always been the “Professional Developer <em>Community</em>
Bloggers”? I met with
<a href="http://www.microsoftregionaldirectors.com/Extranet/DirectorDetails.aspx?did=1141">Kevin</a>
and <a href="http://drewby.net/">Drew</a> during PDC, for <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/09/19/today-is-the-last-day-of-my-life-so-far/">obvious
reasons</a>.</li>
<li>I’m not sure I get why this <a href="http://www.nextl3vel.net/Chris123NT/PDC_4051/LHGuide.html">Longhorn Tweaking
Guide</a>
advises uninstalling WinFS. The authors of the guide “wouldn’t trust
WinFS to be stable enough to house my data just yet”. Personally, I
wouldn’t trust Longhorn to be stable enough to house my data just
yet. What’s the point of developing for Longhorn now if you’re not
going to use the big three pillars: Avalon/WinFS/Indigo?</li>
</ul>
<p>To top off the craziness of this past week, my team is having our big
event – the Strategic Architects Forum – in Redmond next week. That
means another week of 12 hour plus days. At least this time I get to
sleep in my own bed each night. Since there are few (if any) bloggers
outside of our team going to this event, I’ll be writing much more about
SAF than I did about PDC.</p>
<p>To those who attended, thanks again for making our Architecture
Symposium a raging success. Please let us know how we can continue and
improve this for future conferences. You can reach me via the info on my

card</a> or you
