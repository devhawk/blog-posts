I finally got around to signing up for a FeedBurner feed for DevHawk
today. It’s available [here](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Devhawk). I’ve
updated my site template, but existing readers are still getting the old
feed. Scott has [built
support](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SyndicatingComputerZen.aspx) for
FeedBurner into dasBlog, but it isn’t released yet. Feel free to switch
over on your own if you want, but I’ll get the automatic redirection
working soon enough.

**Update**: Apparently I didn’t look hard enough. FeedBurner support made
it into the currently shipping version of dasBlog, so I’ve turned it on.
Thanks to [Tomas Restrepo](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/) for the
[heads
up](http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,04960B18-350D-42C8-939A-E36C908B8CC4.aspx#11a60941-d728-480e-89f1-45620788ccd7).
