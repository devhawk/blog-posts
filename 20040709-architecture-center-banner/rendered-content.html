<p>For TechEd, we got a big banner to hang in the lunch room to advertise
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture">Architecture Center</a>. When we
got it back, we hung it in the atrium of building 18 – our new home.
Looks pretty cool, doesn’t it? In the pic, from left to right, are my
boss Adam Denning, yours truly (in desperate need of a haircut) and

Richard and Megan who got the banner hung in the first place.</p>
