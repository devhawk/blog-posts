<li>My daughter had her tonsils &amp; adenoids out on yesterday. It was a
routine procedure and it went by-the-numbers, but any parent will
tell you it’s hard to see your kid in a hospital bed.</li>
<li>Given the previous bullet, I’m not at the <a href="http://www.mssoaandbpconference.com/">SOA/BPM
conference</a> for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/oct07/10-30OsloPR.mspx">big
announcement</a>.
Don’t worry, there’s lots of other folks covering the news.</li>
<li>It was a crappy sports weekend in the Pierson house. Va Tech
<a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272980259">snatched defeat from the jaws of
victory</a>,
Southern Cal <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273002483">never led at
Oregon</a>, the
Capitals
<a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=271026023">lost</a>
<a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=271027019">twice</a>,
and the Redskins <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=271028017">got blown out by the
Pats</a>. At
least the Caps <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=271029021">won big
yesterday</a> in
Toronto.</li>
<li>Speaking of the Capitals, Peter Bondra <a href="http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?articleid=341538&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page">retired
Monday</a>.
I still think it’s <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/02/19/doing-the-unthinkable/">a
travesty</a>
that he didn’t spend his whole career in DC, but I’ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/07/06/meeting-ted-leonsis/">made my
peace</a> with
it.</li>
<li>Nick Malik has a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/10/12/soa-and-the-cisr-operating-models.aspx">great
series</a>
on business operations models and how they apply to SOA. Regular
readers should be unsurprised that I favor low standardization,
though I can see the value of high integration. That makes the
Coordinated Operating Model my fav, though I can see the benefit of
the Diversified Model as well. I can’t wait to read what Nick has to
say on changing models.</li>
<li>Speaking of Nick, I’m doing a roundtable with him on “Making SOA
Work in the Enterprise” @ the Strategic Architect Forum. Should be
fun. Sorry for the lack of linkage on this, but it’s an invite-only
event.</li>
<li>Jezz Santos has a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jezzsa/archive/2007/10/29/packaging-building-software-factories-series.aspx">new series of white
papers</a>
on building software factories. First up “<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb880038.aspx">Packaging with Visual
Studio
2005</a>”</li>
<li>Aaron Skonnard has <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/archive/2007/10/29/48887.aspx">a new
whitepaper</a>
on using the WCF LOB Adapter SDK with BTS 2006 R2. I’ve been
building one of these things recently, so I’m looking forward to
checking that out. (via <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/10/29/aaron-s-wcf-adapters-in-biztalk-server-r2-paper-up.aspx">Sam
Gentile</a>)</li>
<li>Tim Ewald looks at Resource Oriented Architecture (when did ROA
become a TLA?) and
<a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2007/10/19/48805.aspx">wonders</a>
“what if your problem domain is more focused on processes than
data?” I wonder that all the time. (via <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/10/26/tim-on-roa-vs-get-and-post.aspx">Jesus

<li>It’s not just durable messaging – <a href="http://lsblog.wordpress.com/">Libor
Soucek</a> also
<a href="http://lsblog.wordpress.com/2007/10/26/missing-pragmatic-view-on-management-of-soa-based-system/">disagrees</a>
with <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/10/25/the-worst-of-both-worlds/">my
opinions</a>
on centralized control. I agree 100% with Libor that centralized
management would make operation’s lives “much, MUCH easier” as he
puts it. However, that doesn’t make it feasible at any significant
scale. Furthermore, I wouldn’t describe an approach that requires
that “all services adopt [the] same common management interface” as
“pragmatic”. Frankly, just <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/impractical">the
opposite</a>.</li>
