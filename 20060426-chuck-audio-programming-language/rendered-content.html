<p>I saw reference to <a href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/">ChucK</a> on <a href="http://secondlife.blogs.com/prompt/">Prompt
Criticality</a>, a <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second
Life</a> Blog. I wanted to blog it for my own
reference if for no other reason. ChucK is “a new audio programming
language for real-time synthesis, composition, and performance” that
“presents a new <em>time-based concurrent programming model</em>, which
supports a more precise and fundamental level of expressiveness, as well
as multiple, simultaneous, dynamic control rates, a <em>precise and
straightforward concurrency</em>, and the ability to add, remove, and modify
code, <em>on-the-fly</em>, while the program is running, without stopping or
restarting”.</p>
<p>Sounds facinating, esp. given my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/04/14/talking-dynamic-lanugages-with-neal-ford/">recent
discussion</a>
of internal vs. external DSLs w/ Neal Ford. Plus it deals w/ concurrency
and is dynamic.</p>
