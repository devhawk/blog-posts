As I pointed out in my [last
post](http://devhawk.net/2005/02/25/putting-a-square-peg-model-in-a-round-hole-tool/),
VS2005 includes a Class Designer that those familiar with the UML class
model should feel right at home in. By happy coincidence, I found out
today the [Class Designer team is
blogging](http://blogs.msdn.com/classdesigner/). Additionally, two of
the Class Designer team members –
[Ramesh](http://blogs.msdn.com/r.ramesh) and
[Rakesh](http://blogs.msdn.com/rakeshna) - are blogging on their own.
Apparently, the team blog will feature a new post every Thursday. [This
week’s
post](http://blogs.msdn.com/classdesigner/archive/2005/02/25/380023.aspx)
features an overview of the v1 Class Designer goals. Subscribed.
