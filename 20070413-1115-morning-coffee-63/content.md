-   My friend Christoph Schittko (who used to blog
    [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/cschittko/), but hasn’t written
    anything in almost two years) recently wrote on an internal email
    thread that he “wonder[s] how many more attempts for “enterprise
    wide” thingies we need for people to figure out that there’s too
    much complexity involved to coordinate anything enterprise wide.” I
    couldn’t agree more, though I think it’s more than just complexity
    at work here. There are significant forces driving decentralization
    in society in general and IT in particular, and anything enterprise
    wide is by definition centralized.
-   I’m way behind on this, but Ray Ozzie did an [fascinating
    interview](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1698)
    with Knowledge@Wharton. I was especially interested in his
    separation of “big-I” and “small-i” innovation. Sounds like
    disruptive and sustaining innovation from [The Innovator’s
    Dilemma](http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Management-Innovation/dp/0875845851)
    to me.
-   According to [Mary Jo
    Foley](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=385), my ex-teammate
    [Mike Walker](http://blogs.msdn.com/mikewalker/) is “da man” on
    [Office Business
    Applications](http://blogs.msdn.com/mikewalker/archive/2007/03/29/what-are-obas.aspx),
    or OBA’s.
-   I think I have an old PocketPC hanging around in a drawer somewhere.
    Apparently, I can use it as a [caller ID
    server](http://www.binaryrefinery.com/main/PermaLink,guid,d8f9b0a3-f884-4a81-87e5-448d2beda19c.aspx) instead
    of gathering dust. That’s sorta freaky. (via [Backstage @

-   Quote of the Day: “If you have a live show on a TV network, Its not
    good to have a brain fart during a slow news week.” – [Mark
    Cuban](http://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/04/12/imus-fcc-cable-limits-and-corporately-owned-media/).
    Personally, I don’t care one way or the other about Don Imus, but
    Mark’s points about the conservatism of media corporations are spot
    on.
