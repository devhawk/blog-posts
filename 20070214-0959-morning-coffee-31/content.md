-   Architect MVP business news keeps on coming. Today it’s Corillian –
    the company Scott Hansleman works for – [getting acquired by
    CheckFree](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheNextStepCheckFreeToAcquireCorillianFor245m.aspx).
-   Los Angeles is looking to provide [city-wide low-cost (maybe free)
    wireless
    access](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-fi-wifi14feb14,0,3502072.story).
    My father has often suggested that Internet access be treated like
    other utilities like water and power. Sounds like LA is heading down
    that path. I wonder if they’re looking at WiMAX?
-   The [.NET Micro
    Framework](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/embedded/bb267253.aspx)
    – which powers [the SPOT watch](http://direct.msn.com/) – now has an
    SDK. For those keeping track, that makes three embedded solution
    platforms from Microsoft, the Micro FX, [Windows
    CE](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/embedded/eval/wince) (which
    also just shipped a [new
    version](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/feb07/02-11WM6SoftwarePR.mspx))
    and [Windows XP
    Embedded](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/embedded/eval/xpe). (via

    on a topic I am particularly passionate about: putting more power in
    business people’s hands to build their own systems. (via [Joe

-   The final version of [Live Search for
    Mobile](http://mobile.search.live.com/about/) was released a few
    days ago. This program rocks. I’m using the Windows Mobile version,
    but there’s also J2ME version as well. (via [Dare
    Obasanjo](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=96d7d686-ede6-4a3e-8345-a96c12c55fa9))
-   Any lingering interest I had in Ruby vanished yesterday as got to
    chapter 8 of [Windows Powershell in
    Action](http://www.manning.com/payette/). Chapter 8 is called
    “ScriptBlocks and Objects” and it is specifically about
    meta-programming. After reading that chapter, PS seems *more*
    flexible in this space than Ruby, which is the current industry
    darling for metaprogramming. For example, in Ruby you can optionally
    pass a block of code to any method. In PS, you can define a
    ScriptBlock like any other parameter. That means you can tell from
    the method signature that the ScriptBlock is used. Or you can define
    a function that takes multiple ScriptBlock parameters. Much more
    thought on this is needed.
