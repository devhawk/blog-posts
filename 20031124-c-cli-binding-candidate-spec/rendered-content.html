<p>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/10/06/2-great-technologies-that-taste-great-together/">blogged</a> on
the new ECMA working group for <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/news/ecma-TG5-PR.htm">standardizing the C++ binding for
CLI</a> last month.
Last week, <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/hsutter/">Herb Sutter</a>
<a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/hsutter/permalink.aspx/44e3520b-b8ca-4961-8930-59346e721a9b">blogged</a>
the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/9/c/99c65bcd-ac66-482e-8dc1-0e14cd1670cd/C++%20CLI%20Candidate%20Base%20Draft.pdf">candidate
specification</a>.
And to answer the question I posed, it does appear that the double
underscore syntax has been removed. Instead of “__gc class {…}”, it’s
just “ref class”. For __value and __property, you just lose the
double underscore. Cool, though it does mean any MC++ code will
eventually need to be migrated to the new syntax. Also. the
specification is forward looking, including support for CLI generics.</p>
<p>Herb also blogged in depth on the <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/hsutter/permalink.aspx/9a9b7f1a-652e-4f18-b431-bfea2fd554d7">new
