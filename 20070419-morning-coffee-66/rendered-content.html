<p>Yesterday’s Morning Coffee was canceled on account of rain. In my living
room. It’s fixed now.</p>

<a href="http://ozymandias.com/archive/2007/04/19/Fun-with-High-Capacity-Barcodes.aspx">writes</a>
about MS Research’s new <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/hccb/">High Capacity Color
Barcodes</a> technology.
As he points out, there’s some fascinating gaming potential for
these barcodes because they have such high capacity (something like
2kb per square inch) and can be read without special equipment (a
camera phone should work).</li>
<li>According to a <a href="http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=319">Pew Research Center
report</a>,
Daily Show/Colbert Report viewers are significantly better informed
than Fox News viewers. On the other hand, they’re only slightly more
informed than O’Reilly Factor viewers or Rush Limbaugh listeners so
it seems like a wash.</li>
<li>Speaking of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, you <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/04/17/the-daily-show-and-the-colbert-report-now-on-vmp.aspx">can now
download
them</a>
from Xbox LIVE Video Marketplace. But at <del>$2</del> 160 points an
episode, it’s cheaper to set my DVR.</li>
<li>I recently re-discovered <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/remusrusanu/default.aspx">Remus Rusanu’s SSB
blog</a>. He went dark
for a few months there, but he’s recently posted a new version of
his <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/slm">Service Listing Manager utility</a>,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/remusrusanu/archive/2007/04/03/orlando-slides-and-code.aspx">presented</a>
SSB at DevConnections and showed how to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/remusrusanu/archive/2007/04/11/consuming-event-notifications-from-clr.aspx">implement a managed stored
proc</a>
to receive SQL DDL <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190427.aspx">event
notifications</a>.
Event notifications is one of those features I didn’t even realize
was in SQL.</li>
<li>Dottie Shaw, one of the program managers on my project, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dotties">has started
blogging</a>. That leaves two team mates
and one project member still not blogging.</li>
<li>Yesterday, I stumbled into some other teams morale event. They were
bogarting the cafeteria, so it wasn’t like I was crashing it or
anything. Normally, I wouldn’t hang around some other teams party,
but they had a projector, an Xbox 360 and two copies of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/guitarhero2">Guitar
Hero</a> so I had to hang out
and watch them play head-to-head for a while. That looks like a
<em>fun</em> game.</li>
<li>Chris Anderson <a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2007/04/long_tail_enemy.html">writes at
length</a>
about the primary enemy of Long Tail economics: “the
absurdly complicated and expensive process of rights clearance”. His
case in point is the coming DVD release of WKRP in Cincinnati, which
has replaced the dozens of songs used as background music with
“Muzak-style songs that could be licensed in perpetuity for a small
flat fee” that
<a href="http://blog.wired.com/music/2007/04/wkrp_in_cincinn.html">apparently</a>
“sucked ass”.</li>
</ul>
