<p>Last week, I asked <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/06/05/a-rest-question/">a REST
Question</a>: is it
still REST if you don’t use HTTP? My interest in durable messaging is
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/30/the-case-for-durable-messaging-in-service-orientation/">well
documented</a>,
so I want is to see a RESTful approach combined with a durable
messaging. We all know my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/10/23/the-other-foundation-technology/">durable messaging tool of
choice</a>,
though I’d trade SSB in a second for something that provided durable
duplex messaging in a standard way.</p>
<p>Anyway, there were some fairly interesting responses that I wanted to
highlight.</p>
<p>Probably most interesting to the discussion at hand was <a href="http://johnheintz.blogspot.com">John

out the existence of
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waka_%28protocol%29">Waka</a>” ,  a new
transfer protocol to replace HTTP from Roy Fielding. The fact that Dr.
REST is working on a new protocol that’s designed to be more RESTful
than HTTP should put to bed any REST “is and only is” HTTP arguments.</p>
<p>Erik Johnson agrees that you can separate REST and HTTP, but he
<a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,87AE6135-942F-4476-9DD7-9992CF073A7A.aspx#e80b80a3-bfdb-4615-8516-57193dfed280">thinks</a>
I ought to call it something else. He
<a href="http://appside.blogspot.com/2007/06/rest-over-http.html">suggests</a>
“resource-oriented” – have we created a new TLA here? Are you down with
ROA, ROAD, ROD, ROP and all the other acronyms we could spawn?</p>
<p>Nick Malik <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/06/what-is-the-rest-high-order-bit.aspx">breaks
out</a>
the IFaP acronym – Identifier, Format, Protocol – and points out “Each
of the successful Internet standards, from HTTP to SMTP, has an IFaP at
the heart of it.” But does anyone think SMTP is RESTful? I don’t. I
think standardization of IFaP’s is on par in importance with
RESTfulness, but they’re orthogonal. That is to say I think Nick’s wrong
– I’m guessing we’ll go a few rounds on this when he gets back from
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/12/showing-up-can-be-the-hardest-part.aspx">Nashville</a>
– or should I say, <em>if</em> he gets back?
😄</p>
<p>Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz <a href="http://www.ddj.com/blog/architectblog/archives/2007/06/devhawk_harry_p.html">has been
wondering</a>
about REST without HTTP the same way I have, but he doesn’t really go
into detail as to why. I want durable messaging, Arnon mentions
something about topic hierarchies. Couldn’t you do that with HTTP,
Arnon? He also points out a <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/webservices/199902676">new DDJ article on
REST</a>. It’s good, if
high-level overview-y.</p>
<p>Pat Helland
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/06/12/every-noun-can-be-verbed.aspx">writes</a>
that Every Noun Can be Verbed. It’s more related to <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/24/rest-is-neither-crud-nor-crap/">CRUD is
CRAP</a>
than REST == HTTP, but it’s well worth the read. His point about using
filling out a form being CRUD, but then handing the form over to someone
else being an invocation of behavior is fairly eye-opening. As long as
you “interpret the durn’ things with the correct semantics”, it doesn’t
really matter if they’re nouns or verbs.</p>
<p>Last but not least, <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a> and Adrian
Trenaman <a href="http://tssblog.techtarget.com/index.php/xmlweb-services/neward-and-trenaman-consider-rest-or-the-great-and-complete-soap-vs-pox-debate/">discuss SOAP vs.
POX</a>
over on The Server Side. They focus too much on SOAP encoding (isn’t
that dead yet?), but near the end Ted points out: “Problem is, REST
assumes that you want to carry all of the state in the payload itself,
and for a modern enterprise system, or, hell, even for a game, that’s
not always a safe assumption.” Doesn’t address my questions about using
REST without HTTP, but a very good point nonetheless.</p>
