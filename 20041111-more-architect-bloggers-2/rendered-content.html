Solivan</a> is an architect advisor and
an ex-teammate from my old .NET Adoption Team days. So far, David
appears to be blogging at conferences. He started in July at MGB and
then went dark for a few months. He picked back up at SAF. I hear he’s
at a conference this week, so maybe we’ll see some more from him.</p>
<p>That brings the total number of bloggers from my team to 14. That’s over
half of the team and I know at least two more coming down the pipe.</p>
