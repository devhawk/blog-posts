-   My brother is a VaTech alumni, so the shock of the [deadly shootings
    there yesterday](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18134671/) hits very
    close to home. My heavy heart is with the grieving Hokie nation
    today.

    [great](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000838.html)[posts](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000839.html)
    on Language vs. Platform. Earlier in my MSFT career, I spent a
    significant amount of time explaining .NET, often to companies that
    had made a significant investment in Java. Picking the Java platform
    is fine (it’s almost the best platform around!), but it seemed many
    people I spoke to didn’t understand the fact that “[w]hen you choose
    a language, like it or not, you’ve chosen a *platform*“.

    Service](http://devhawk.net/2007/03/21/when-is-a-service-not-a-service/) post.
    I like Ian’s thinking about SaaS as an analogy for SOA adoption – if
    for no other reason that SaaS is easier to “get”. But trying to
    realize SOA via SaaS inside the enterprise is a mistake in my
    opinion (and I think Ian would agree with that). SaaS is a business
    model, and I don’t think you want to turn your enterprise into an
    internal service marketplace. Instead, this ties back with Nick
    Malik’s points about [central
    planning](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/04/14/is-central-planning-impossible.aspx). Regardless
    if I’m right or wrong, I
    [subscribed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/itblagger) to Ian’s blog
    (and not just because he linked to me – check out his [Elements of
    the Future Business
    Ecosystem](http://itblagger.wordpress.com/2007/04/07/elements-of-the-future-business-ecosystem-part-i/ "Read Elements of the Future Business Ecosystem (Part I)"))

    AIA). Joe McKendrick [calls
    it](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=857) “Big SOA”. Isn’t
    this the market segment that BizTalk has been in for seven years?
