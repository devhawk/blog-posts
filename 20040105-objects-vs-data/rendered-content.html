Programming language evolution is something I’ve keenly interested in.
When I first started this blog almost a year ago, <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/01/17/disruptive-programming-language-technologies/">one of my early
posts</a>
was about a disruptive programming language technologies presentation
from MS Research. Among the areas mentioned for improvement: were
database integration and XML manipulation. Sounds like the Xen language
<a href="http://www.xmlconference.org/xmlusa/2003/friday.asp#7">demoed @ XML
2003</a> is a step
in that direction.</p>
<p>When you read Erik’s papers, you’ll notice that one of the goals is to
natively integrate XML into the language. He writes: “In our approach
XML documents or document fragments become first class citizens.” What’s
interesting about that is that if you take XML to mean pure-infoset-data
(as opposed to angle-bracket-serialization-format) then you can argue
that Data (with a capital D) is not a first class citizen of today’s
Object-Oriented languages. Given that a lot of OO code has been written
to manipulate data, having a language that explicitly distinguished
between the two could be valuable (assuming it made the programming
easier and the programmer more productive).</p>
<p>Note, this is the opposite approach from tools like O/R mappers and
XSD.exe which attempt to hide the differences from the programmer. We’ve
seen a similar evolution in the way we think about invoking objects
across the network. Tools like DCOM and .NET Remoting attempt to hide
the RPC and make it appear as a local call. But as the thinking evolves,
tools like
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/01/Indigo/default.aspx">Indigo</a>
is designed to make the boundaries across apps and machines explicit.
Initial thoughts on data access were to make it all look like objects
(i.e. O/R mapping). But as the thinking evolves, maybe we need to make
the boundaries between objects and data explicit (and easy) as well.</p>
