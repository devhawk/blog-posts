<p><a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/jeffsch">Jeff Schlimmer</a> has <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/jeffsch/default.aspx?key=2003-06-12T08:43:15Z">the
latest</a>
on the new <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/desc/">drafts of WSDL 1.2</a>. Given
my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/01/20/wsdl-soapaction-issues/">general
issues</a> with
WSDL, Iâ€™m very excited about the changes. Port Type -&gt; Interface.
Service/Port -&gt; Service/End Point. Plus a whole new document on message
patterns. Want to read, but for now, I must sleep.</p>
