We just published a [white
paper](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/entarch.asp)
about the Enterprise Architectural Space Organizing Table. Basically,
this is a table for categorizing architectural artifacts such as
patterns. It owes a great deal to Zachman, but really builds out the
concepts of roles and viewpoints. In addition to the white paper, you
can get a PDF of [the table
itself](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/C/4/0C44F7EB-893F-4048-B2C6-C1C889E06DF1/MOAG_F02.pdf).

What’s ultra-cool about this table is that it’s what the
[p&p](http://microsoft.com/practices) group uses internally. The white
paper maps [every pattern MSFT has
published](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx)
into the table. You can also see the EASOT viewpoints in action in the
[Project
Notebook](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/intpatt-ch07.asp) section
of [Integration
Patterns](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/intpatt.asp).
When I saw a print of the table hanging on the wall in p&p’s building, I
knew I wanted to see it published online. Love it or hate it, it’s real.

What do you think? Obviously, we’re planning on building on EASOT going
forward. Is this useful? Valuable?
