<p>A while ago, Chris
<a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/default.aspx?content=archive.htm#giantSuckingSound">spouted</a>
on the then-trend of all of his friends coming to work for MSFT. He
himself <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/#boldBeginning">joined
up</a> six month after
writing that entry. Now, there seem to be a bunch of new consulting
companies sprouting up. <a href="http://www.thinktecture.com/">ThinkTecture</a>,
<a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/">PluralSight</a> (thanks for the shirt
Keith!), <a href="http://www.barracuda.net/">Barracuda.NET</a> and
<a href="http://wangdera.com/">Wangdera</a> just to name a few. Most of these seem
to feature <a href="http://www.develop.com/">DevelopMentor</a> alumni. Will we see
newly-minted MSFT alumni join this trend? I know one – my friend Jeff
left MSFT to start his own consulting firm <a href="http://www.securejustice.com/">Secure Justice
Solutions</a>, focusing on <a href="http://www.securejustice.com/">integrated
justice information systems</a>. One isn’t a
trend, but it’s interesting to watch as the economy slowly improves.</p>
<p>Note, unlike Chris, who observed a trend only to become a part of
it a few short months later, we won’t be seeing any “DevHawk Consulting”
nonsense around here. I’m having *way* too much fun doing what I’m
doing w/ Architecture Strategy. Besides, I get to <del>torment</del> work with
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland">Pat</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: In the comments, Avery pointed out that Rob Howard <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/archive/2004/06/02/146806.aspx">has
left
MSFT</a> to
create a company called »telligent systems.</p>
