<p>My father recommended I not blog politics, under the mistaken assumption
that this is a “technical blog”. For the record, this isn’t a technical
blog, it’s my personal blog and I blog about what I’m interested in.
Usually, it’s technology, development and/or architecture. Sometimes
it’s
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/09/10/long-cold-winter-without-hockey/">hockey</a>.
Sometimes it’s
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/06/08/thoughts-on-prisoner-of-azkaban/">movies</a>.
Right now, I’m abnormally interested in politics – go figure. I’m a week
behind on tech blog reading, but I’m currently reading over a dozen
political blogs every day.</p>
<p>This political “season” has had a significant effect on me. Call me a
slow learner, but I’m beginning to figure out that politics isn’t just
something to think about once a year at election time – or worse, once
every four years when at presidential election time. I’m sure regular
readers can guess <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/">who I support</a> for
president, but I haven’t quite figured out how my new-found-interest in
politics will effect my day-to-day life after Election Day. I won’t
bother you with any political reasoning (yet) since you’ve either made
up your mind, in which case nothing I say will make a difference either
way, or you haven’t, in which case you’re getting bombarded on all sides
to make a decision and anything I say will be lost in the cacophony. But
I do want to share one quote with you, which I found doing a little
research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force; like
fire, a troublesome servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment
should it be left to irresponsible action.”</p>
<ul>
<li>George Washington</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of who wins in November, I will never turn my back on this
troublesome servant and fearful master again.</p>
