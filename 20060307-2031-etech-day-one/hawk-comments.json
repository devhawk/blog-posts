    "content": "Borders in the Gaslamp area (about 4 blks from hotel) appears to have at least one copy of the Shaping Things book in stock.\n\nI will admit a certain degree of disappointment in ETECH. It feels like a conference that is more impressed with itself than actually illuminating ideas for the attendees. The overall staging is pretty poor as well. Not free-for-all as an unconference but not nearly at the standards I would expect for the amount of money paid."
