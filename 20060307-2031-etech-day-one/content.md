Of course, I my copious notes are on my dead laptop, so this is all from
memory. Granted, it was only yesterday and my memory isn’t THAT bad
(yet).

**Rael Dornfest on the Attention Economy**\
You know the old saying if you can’t say something nice, don’t say
anything at all? The one thing I will say is that it felt like a sales
pitch to come to the conference. Given that we we’re already there, it
seemed like an odd choice. I’ll have more about Attention Economy with
my post on today’s sessions.

**Tim O’Reilly on O’Reilly Radar**\
Tim had (not surprisingly) a bunch of interesting things to talk
about. Probably the most interesting was the stuff about [Bionic
Software](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/03/bionic_software_1.html)
which Tim describes as a system “that combines the biological and
mechanical systems to create an enhanced system that is more powerful
than either alone.” He described this as Intelligence Augmentation,
instead of Artificial Intelligence. Bruce Sterling later talked about
the importance of how things are named, and IA over AI is a great
example of that.

However, Tim also went on at great length about the [architecture of
participation](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/articles/architecture_of_participation.html)
and [harnessing collective
intelligence](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html?page=2).
He’s given many examples of these, however I’m wondering if he’s over
generalizing based on a few success stories. Companies like Amazon and
Ebay are successful because they’re in the middle of financial
transactions. Google’s been able to monetize the long tail of search to
an amazing degree, but the growth of that market is slowing and Google
has been unable to significantly monetize any of their other efforts (so
far, though I doubt that trend will continue). Sites like del.icio.us
and Flickr are great, but I don’t see evidence of a business plan
outside of “get acquired”. On the [del.icio.us about
page](http://del.icio.us/about/info), it specifically says that
del.icio.us started as a hobby. Granted, hosting costs these days are
such that you can run a hobby site for nearly nothing and cover that
cost with Google Ads. But as a business, if there’s only a few business
success stories, why place the importance on the crowd’s wisdom?

**Bruce Sterling on The Internet of Things**\
I couldn’t do this talk justice even with my notes, so here are a
couple of things that stood out:

-   The guy introducing Bruce was a little to lavish with his praise. It
    was actually a little creepy. Bruce even remarked on it.
-   I wish Bruce hadn’t read so many quotes from other people. It was
    hard to follow when he was providing his own opinions or someone
    else’s. He didn’t use many slides (yeah!) and the ones he did use
    didn’t have bullets (even better!) but when he’s quoting someone
    else, I think it makes sense to put the words up on a slide.
-   He seemed to alternate between praising and disrespecting the crowd
    in the room. For example, he commented that “hype is an attention
    interrupt” which seems validate the work of many Web 2.0 companies
    even though so many people dismiss it as hype. However, he also made
    the comment that Web 2.0 was an effort by alpha geeks to wrest
    control of the web back.
-   The main thrust of his talk was about applying Internet concepts
    like sorting and searching to the real world by creating links
    between real-world items and virtual counterparts. So you would
    never lose your keys again because you could easily Google them. I
    need to pick up his latest book “Shaping Things” for the flight home
    – it’s not like I’ll be using my computer.

Stick around, I’ll be posting my thoughts on today’s session a little
later.
