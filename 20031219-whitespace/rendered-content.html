<p>While checking out the <a href="http://www.sscli.net/servlets/ProjectList">list of
projects</a> hosted at the
<a href="http://www.sscli.net/">Rotor Community site</a>, I stumbled across an
<a href="http://wspcnet.sscli.net/">implementation for Rotor</a>
of  <a href="http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php">Whitespace</a> “a
programming language whose syntax is entirely based on space (0×20) tab
(0×09) and (0x0A) linefeed”. Seriously.</p>
<p>BTW, the other projects on the Rotor community are much more useful.
Check them out.</p>
