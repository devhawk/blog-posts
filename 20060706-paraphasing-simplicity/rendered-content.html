<p>Albert Einstein is often credited with saying “Everything should be made
as simple as possible, but no simpler”. However, in <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">researching the
quote</a> on Wikiquote, I
discovered the full quote is actually:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic
elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender
the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s funny that the canonical quote on simplicity is actually a
simplified version of a significantly more verbose quote.</p>
