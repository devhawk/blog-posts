    "content": "You gotta get over to Akihabara (Electric Town) for some great electronics stores. Check out the refridgerators! They are great! :)\n\nAlso, you can plan a trip to Asakusa in the same half-day (if you don't spend too much time in the toy..er..electronics stores). Asakusa has the Senso-ji shrine and a bunch of gift stores. Some of them are too cheap looking, but you certainly can find whatever you want.\n\nI wish I was there, but I just got back from Sapporo and couldn't stay in Japan any longer.",
