    "content": "I like that response.  I sometimes come across as bing down on the whole educational system, but my point really is that a teacher can never *make* a student learn; teachers exist to give the *opportunity* to the students, and it's (for the most part) up to the students to take advantage of the opportunity.  We still have the best opportunities for education in the world, but increasingly kids have other priorities and distractions.",
