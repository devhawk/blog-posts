<li>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/home/us">Wall Street Journal</a> is
reporting that Massachusetts lawmakers are considering a
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117211275783215723.html?mod=todays_us_marketplace">bill</a>
to punish retailers for leaks in personal data. I wonder how long it
will take for a law like that to go nationwide? Looks like there may
be some good jobs in retail IT data security opening up shortly.</li>
<li>There is an interesting
<a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/webservices/197006946">debate</a> on the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/serviceproviders/saas/default.mspx">SAAS</a>
architecture in <a href="http://www.ddj.com/">Dr. Dobb’s Portal</a>. The money
quote for me was as follows:</li>

<blockquote>
<p>“Ajax and Web 2.0 are great technologies for casual use, but for
mission critical you need the capabilities of a desktop app,” RightNow
CEO Greg Gianforte says.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have to admit I don’t agree with that quote at all. It seems pretty
shortsighted in minimizing the capabilities of web based applications.</p>

on if SOA requires web services. He makes pretty good arguments for
an against a SOA requiring web services and ultimately doesn’t
answer the question. I would say that a SOA doesn’t require web
services, but it is very likely in the range of 90% plus that a SOA
within a company is going to have at least some web services in it.</li>

Monday. I have really enjoyed stepping in being a replacement
blogger this week. While my take on technology is a bit different
that Harry’s I hope that my entries were interesting and offered a
bit of a different perspective on IT.</li>
