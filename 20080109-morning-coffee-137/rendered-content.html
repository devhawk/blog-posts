<li>Note, I somehow duplicated Morning Coffee 135. So I’ve skipped 136
to make up for it.</li>
<li>Congrats to Hillary Clinton for her <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22570407/">unexpected
win</a> in the New Hampshire
primary. As I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/01/07/morning-coffee-135-2/">said last
week</a>, I
think Obama has a better chance of winning in November, but I’ve got
nothing against Clinton or her politics.</li>
<li>Speaking of winning, congrats to LSU on <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=280070194">winning the
BCS</a>. Are they
the best team in college football? Personally, I don’t think so –
there are at least three other teams (Georgia, West VA and of course
USC) who can make a persuasive argument that they should be #1. But
losing to teams like <del>Penn</del> Pitt and Stanford, neither WVA and USC
have an argument they should have been in the championship game. But
that’s what makes the BCS such BS. If nothing else, at least the “we
need a playoff” meme is <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3186232">picking up
steam</a>.</li>
<li>This is sort of cool: <a href="http://www.eye.fi/">Eye-fi</a> is a wireless
enabled SD card so you can wirelessly upload pictures from your
camera to your PC or favorite photo service. However, I think the
price needs to come down a bit. I recently bought a 2GB SD card for
my wife’s new camera for $20. A 2GB Eye-fi card is
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000X27XDC">$99</a>. Not sure wireless
upload is worth 5x per card.</li>
<li>With all the focus on LINQ providing type-safe queries, it’s easy to
forget that some apps do need to build their queries at run time.
Scott Guthrie points at a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/bb894665.aspx">Dynamic LINQ C#
sample</a>
(also <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/bb964686.aspx">available for
VB</a>) that
builds LINQ expression trees from strings. It kinda takes you back
to the bad-old-days of embedding SQL strings in your code, but there
are scenarios – especially BI scenarios – where you need this
capability.</li>

the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D466226B-8DAB-445F-A7B4-448B326C48E7&amp;displaylang=en">VC++ 2008 Feature Pack
Beta</a>.
This is the long-awaited (by who?) MFC update as well as support for
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Report_1">C++ TR1</a>. TR1
provides some FP-esque support like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Report_1#Function_Objects">function
objects</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Report_1#Tuple_Types">tuples</a>,
so maybe this is worth a look. On the other hand, given that much
(all?) of TR1 is lifted from <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>, maybe
we should just use that.</li>
<li>Speaking of cool libraries, check out
<a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/c5/">C5</a> (aka the Copenhagen
Comprehensive Collection Classes for C#). It’s basically a complete
redesign of System.Collections.Generic (or SCG as they call it).
I’ve read thru their <a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/c5/Release1.0/ITU-TR-2006-76.pdf">online
book</a>
and I’m very impressed. Of course, with me focused on F# of late,
I’m primarily using immutable collections, so I’m not sure how much
use I have for C5 right now.</li>
<li>There was a free CoDe magazine in my DevTeach bag back in November
with a <a href="http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=990712182">fascinating
article</a>
on where LINQ goes from here – LINQ 2.0 if you will. One of things
the article discusses is tier-splitting, which has seen the light of
day in <a href="http://labs.live.com/volta/">Volta</a>. Will Volta also deliver
External Relationships, Reshaping Combinators and Join Patterns or
will those come from different projects?</li>
<li>I had to pave my workstation yesterday. I was running an interim
build of Vista x64 SP1 and I couldn’t make Virtual Server work with
it. As part of the repave, I discovered I needed to update the
firmware of my SCSI controller, but the update had to run under DOS.
Freaking DOS? My workstation doesn’t even have a floppy drive to
boot DOS from! However, I was able to <a href="http://www.bay-wolf.com/usbmemstick.htm">boot from a USB thumb
disk</a> instead. That’s damn
useful.</li>
