If you’re using the [MSN Deskbar](http://beta.toolbar.msn.com/), you
might want to pick up [Gibson
Research’s](http://www.grc.com) [Wizmo](http://www.grc.com/wizmo/wizmo.htm).
Wizmo is a command line tool that provides a grab-bag of tools.
Personally, I use it for the shutdown commands. I’ve mapped several of
them to Deskbar shortcut, particularly “shutdown” and “shutdown!”. The
exclamation point invokes the “damit” variation that overrides
applications and/or device drivers that refuse to shutdown. I know a
repave is in the near future when I’m find myself using shutdown! on a
regular basis.

I’m surprised Wizmo didn’t make [Scott’s Ultimate Power
Tools](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/radiostories/2003/09/09/scottHanselmansUltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolsList.html)
list.
