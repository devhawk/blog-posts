<p>I just realized that while I posted the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2011/09/15/using-winrt-from-csharp-build-demo/">demo
steps</a> from
my //build talk, I never posted the talk itself here on DevHawk.
Consider that oversight rectified with this post.</p>
<p>(Note, the static image below appears cut-off, but the video should
scale to the width of my blog automatically. If not, head on over to the
<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-531T">official
page</a> for the
talk over on Channel 9)</p>
