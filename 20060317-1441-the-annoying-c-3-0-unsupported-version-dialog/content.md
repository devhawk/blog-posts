I am sick and tired of the warning dialog box for the [C\# 3.0
preview](http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/7/0/4703eba2-78c4-4b09-8912-69f6c38d3a56/linq%20preview.msi).
Every time you launch VS it pops up a dialog reading “This is an
unsupported version of Microsoft Visual C\# 3.0. As such many features
may not work as expected.” You know, this isn’t my first time working
with alpha or beta quality software. I’m also running [WinFX Feb
CTP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/downloads/getthebeta/default.aspx),
[VB 9.0 Jan
CTP](http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/3/1/b3141ee3-4a13-4061-a96e-4ae3c37ea0e0/LINQ%20VB%20Preview%20(Jan%202006).msi)
and the [Expression Interactive Designer March
CTP](http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/interactive_designer/id_free_trial.aspx).
None of them feel the need to constantly remind me that they’re
unsupported.

Who suddenly thought C\# developers need hand holding?
