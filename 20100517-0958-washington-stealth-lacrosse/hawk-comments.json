    "content": "I'm sorry sir, but as a Pens fan, I completely object to the idea that we got beaten by a drum in Game 7 against the Habs.\n\nWe got our a$$e$ whipped and handed back to us in a burlap sack.\n\nPlease correct this oversight...LOL.\n\nBoston's performance has to be the worst because it is so historic.  The #1 seed has lost in the first round before (forgetting the year, but the Wings did it at least once, if not twice...which might bode well for the Caps as much as I cringe to think about it as a Pens fan...back in the day, I think there was a movement to dump Yzerman from the Wings because he couldn't win...think about that for a minute)."

    "content": "I dunno - teams have blown 3-1 series leads and #1 seeds have lost to #8 seeds, but the combination of #1 seed blowing a 3-1 series hasn't ever happned, so I still think it's worse than Boston's performance, though maybe only worse by a little bit.\n\nComparisons to Yzerman's Wings as well as Gretzky's Oilers have been plentiful in Washington. I just hope management doesn't hear those and think nothing has to change. The team doesn't need to be blown up and rebuild, but it does need tweaking. "
