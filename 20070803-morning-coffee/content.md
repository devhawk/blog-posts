    conversation](http://lsblog.wordpress.com/2007/07/30/epilog-on-durable-message-discussion/)
    about durable messaging. We still don’t agree, but he says he “fine”
    with durable messaging. He does go out of his way to differentiate
    between *enterprise* and *supporting* systems. But when you’re
    building connected systems, does that differentiation still matter?
-   After taking a few months off, [John
    deVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/) is [back at the
    blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2007/08.aspx). Check
    out his [Big SOA/Little SOA
    post](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2007/08/02/big-soa-little-soa-soa-in-the-real-world.aspx).
    I especially like his snowball analogy “How do you build a big
    snowball? You start with a small snowball.”) though he’s also on
    this “middle out” bandwagon. Do we really believe “middle out”
    works, or are we just saying it because we know top down and bottom
    up don’t? And John: You’re welcome!
-   Anyone coming to the [Microsoft SOA & Business Process
    Conference](http://www.mssoaandbpconference.com/) this fall? Maybe
    we can have a shindig / blogger dinner / unconference / something?

    about](http://blogs.msdn.com/remusrusanu/archive/2007/07/31/dynamic-routing-service.aspx)
    SSB’s dynamic routing. One of the (many) cool things about SSB is
    that all the addressing is logical, not physical. Routing is what
    binds logical addresses to physical addresses, and it’s extensible.
-   Martin Fowler
    [discusses](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OneLanguage.html) the
    value of sticking to one language. I agree with his points about
    large frameworks being as difficult to learn as a new language. I’ve
    said for a long time “If you build a framework, build tools to make
    it easy to use your framework”. Language is obviously a core example
    of a tool. Another interesting point Martin makes is the traditional
    “intimate relationship” between scripting languages and C, but that
    the rise of JVM & CLR makes them impossible to ignore. Does the need
    to play well in a managed environment hinder a C based language like
    Ruby when compared to a natively managed scripting language like
    Powershell? Finally, Martin’s “jigger of 80 proof ugliness” quote
    made me laugh.

    [DailyKos](http://www.dailykos.com/)
    is doing for Democrats what [Rush
    Limbaugh](http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/) did for Republicans almost
    twenty years ago: mobilization. Josh Marshall [points
    out](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/016166.php) that “what’s
    happening today is vastly more participatory and distributed…than
    anything happening back then.”
