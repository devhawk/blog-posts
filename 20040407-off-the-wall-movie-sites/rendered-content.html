<p>Thanks to <a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed">Werner</a>
for
<a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000430.html">linking</a>
to the <a href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/">Flick Filosopher</a>. I liked the
analysis of <a href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/flickfilos/archive/2004/jesuschrist.shtml">The Passion of the
Christ</a>
and the comparison Monty Python’s Life of Brian. I especially liked her
<a href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/flickfilos/articles/bestdesign2003.shtml">Best &amp; Worst Of
2003</a>
article as well. An you have <em>got</em> to respect anyone who has “The
Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai: Across the Eighth Dimension” at the top
of their list of <a href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/canon/index.shtml">100 comfort
movies</a>. Only downer –
no RSS feed. &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
<p>The other movie review site I read regularly is <a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/">Mr.
Cranky</a>. I’m a big fan of his unique comments
on bad movies such as ” I have never come closer to tearing my own penis
off and throwing it at the screen while watching a movie” (<a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/tombraider2.html">Laura Croft
2</a>) “Chris Klein is
like Keanu Reeves without any talent…Frankly, I have a hard time even
comprehending that sentence and its terrible implications.”
(<a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/rollerball.html">Rollerball</a>) and “This
film caused the kind of pain I’d normally associate with being shot
through the thigh by a rusty nail from a high-powered nail gun” (<a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/savingsilverman.html">Saving
Silverman</a>). Again,
no RSS feed. &lt;double sigh&gt;</p>
