<p>Is it
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/07/23/new-architect-bloggers/">obvious</a>
that I’ve been rounding up bloggers on my extended team of architects
and architect evangelists? Here’s another: Raj Wall
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rajwall/archive/2004/07/23/193598.aspx">blogged</a> the
first of what appears to be several posts about Patterns of Successful
Software Projects. I like this as it really starts to expand the idea of
what is a pattern. If you look at
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/entarch.asp">EASOT</a>,
you’ll notice a “Development Architecture Viewpoint” that has the
following description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The development architecture viewpoint is concerned with implementing
the other architectures. Applications must be built and maintained in
a systematic, efficient manner. The development architecture is
composed of elements related to this effort, such as design and
development tools, repositories, build master utilities, test suites,
tracking tools, and other tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my <a href="http://theserverside.net/talks/library.tss#HarryPierson">TheServerSide.net Tech
Talk</a>, I
pointed out that Test Driven Development is a pattern. I know there are
a lot more development architecture patterns. Raj’s post starts to
define the terms in this area of the pattern space. Can’t wait to see
what Raj has to say about project context – the more I work with
patterns, the more important I realize context is.</p>
