After months of having my [XBOX](http://xbox.com/) hooked up on my [big
screen TV](http://www.tacp.toshiba.com/televisions/cinemaseries.asp) but
far away from my cable modem, I finally broke down and bought a
[wireless
adapter](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/broadbandnetworking/productdetails.aspx?pid=015)
for it. I had been thinking about wiring the house and/or buying a Media
Center PC. However, Media Center doesn’t support HD inputs (AFAIK)
and HD PVR via
[cable](http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2003/12/comcast_set_to_.html) or
[satellite](http://devhawk.net/2003/12/09/pvr-hdtv/)
should be here shortly. So I decided to skip the wiring job and go
straight to playtime.

My gamertag is “RayTracer”. (Buy me a beer at the next MSFT conference
and I’ll tell you why.) Many thanks to
[Cory](http://www.addressof.com/blog/) for hooking me up with a
[gamertag graphic](http://addressof.com/blog/posts/311.aspx) to live on
my home page.
