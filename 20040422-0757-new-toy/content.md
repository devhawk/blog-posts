I came back from lunch yesterday to discover that my boss had left a new
toy on my desk – a [Smartphone Developer
Kit](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/information/devprograms/smartphonedevkit/default.mspx).
Not sure where he got it, since it’s all sold out. I’m stoked because
I’ve been wanting a Smartphone for a while, but I want to use T-Mobile’s
service and I didn’t want to pay a premium for an unlocked device. Now,
I don’t have to.

Any suggestions on cool Smartphone software?
