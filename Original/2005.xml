		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Christmas was spent with just my local family - me, <a href="http://techiewife.com/">Julie</a>, Patrick and Julie's mom Patty (who lives ten minutes away). New Year's was spent with Julie's side of the family - three of Patty's four children and all six of her grandkids are at Brother Jim's in Santa Barbara. Even Julie's dad drove up, making it the first time this much of her family was together since Julie and I got married 4 1/2 years ago.</p><p>However, it's hard to be happy without feeling for the people who's family and friends were devastated by last week's tsunami. I've got a few friends in the area - I've done TechEd Malaysia twice and have been working closely with the Indian MSFT office of late. I've heard from I think everyone I know in the region and luckily they're all OK (though one had a close call). Of course, there are countless others who were not so lucky and my heart goes out to them. I wish I had more to say, but given the scale and scope of this tragedy, mere words seem almost trite. </p><p>I don't make resolutions anymore, since they are pretty much the same every year (more time with family, lose weight, smarter with money, etc.) I make a little progress on each every year - enough to be somewhat proud of but not enough that I can quit working on it. I've been reading <a href="http://www.chaordic.org/who_hock2.html">Dee Hock's</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1576750744">Birth of the Chaordic Age</a> which my <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/">Dad</a> lent me at thanksgiving and I'm really enjoying it. I've marked down several passages, but this one seems most appropriate for the new year:</p><blockquote><p>"Riches are not in the number of possessions, but the fewness of wants."</p></blockquote><p>By that measure, I know few richer than myself. </p>]]></content:encoded>

I got to watch the game with several college buddies (the benefit of vacationing in LA) and we just had a ball. After the bittersweet shared championship last year, this feels great. Who would have thought it would be over at halftime? I called it "in the refrigerator" 4 minutes into the third when SC went up 45-10. I would have called it at half time, but I figured OU would come out with some life in the second half, but they didn't.</p><p><a href="http://www.uscbookstore.com/index.php?cPath=22013"><img height="64" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/devhawk_images/undisputed.jpg" width="250" align="right" border="0" /></a>While I am glad about many things about this season, I am most glad that the Orange Bowl rout leaves the title undisputed. Even the most die-hard Auburn fan, having watched their team nearly blow the Sugar Bowl the night before, has got to be hard pressed to honestly argue that they deserve to be #1. Especially when they think to the last time they played USC - they got <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=232420002">shutout at home 23-0</a>. Sure, Auburn isn't the same team but then again, neither is USC.</p><p>There's already talk of USC being a <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls04/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&amp;id=1959543">dynasty</a> and of a threepeat (or should that be three-Pete?) Frankly, that talk is a little premature in my opinion. But given the massive drought USC football went through when I was in school there (during the decade long plus losing streak to Notre Dame) it sure is nice to be on top.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I disagree on the Auburn comment- I think they can make a credible claim. They had a close game with Va. Tech, which probably should have beaten USC earlier in the season. That was a very close game with some questionable calls. Those kinds of calls are part of every game though, and USC did win. But it was close (closer than the score indicates). Also, I think it is clear that the SEC is a tougher conference to play in, and Auburn ran the table.

Having said all that, my personal opinion is that USC proved that they deserve it this year.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, we can agree on this.  USC is the proud new owner of an uncontested national championship, and it is well deserved.  I personally don't think things like "how convincing was the win" should come into play in the rankings, but the bottom line is, while I think Auburn would have put up more of a fight than OU, I don't think they would have won.  USC came to play, and claimed their national title with fervor.

Congrats.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">First it was Halo 2's online stats, game viewer and RSS feeds. Now, MechAssault 2 introduces the concept of <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/">Conquest</a>. While Halo 2's online gaming experience is awesome, it doesn't lead anywhere - each game is completely unrelated to the others. But with Conquest, each battle impacts the ownership of planets in the galaxy. Each player joins one of the <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/houses/">five houses</a> and then can participate in the galactic war. Planet ownership is based on the results of battles fought there. You can see the <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/map/">current map of the galaxy</a> as well as <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/updates/">war updates</a> at any time. (But no RSS feed for the war updates - what's up with that?)</p><p align="left">The only bad thing is that MechAssault 2 doesn't appear to have any per game stats like Halo 2 has. Wouldn't that be a great experience - Halo 2's game viewer and per game stats combined with MechAssault 2's conquest metagame. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apparently Napster to Go is old news, having been launched in beta months ago. They don't appear to be marketing it - the only mention of it I could find was on the page of <a href="http://www.napster.com/compatible_devices/">compatible devices</a>. I'm guessing the reason is the page only lists five devices compatible with the Napster to Go service and all of them are portable media centers. I wanted to search for other devices compatible with <!--StartFragment -->Windows Media Digital Rights Management 10 but the PlaysForSure advance search isn't working. There's new firmware for the <a href="http://www.nomadworld.com/downloads/firmware/wma-getfw.asp?nProdID=556&amp;sProd=Creative%20Zen%20Micro">Zen Micro</a> that supports WMDRM 10, but nothing yet for the Zen Xtra. On the plus side, I discovered the <a href="http://developer.creative.com/articles/article.asp?cat=3&amp;sbcat=38&amp;top=53&amp;aid=71">Nomad SDK</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/friendlynomad">FriendlyNomad</a> C# wrapper for the SDK. Not sure what I would write that accessed my Nomad - I which I could customize the playback experience but Red Chair Software's <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/">Notmad Explorer</a> provides a great PC expereince.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Norman <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/2005/01/to-blog-how-to-blog-what-to-blog-why.html">blogs</a> about how he chose what blog service to use. His criteria were: 1) ease of use and 2) look of the final product. (Of course, look of the final product was important to Norman - he's in marketing!) As a developer and architect, I originally cared most about "rolling my own", though I switched over to dasBlog about a year ago. (I just don't have the time to roll-my-own as often as I used to.) However, given that I had invested significant effort into the look of my final product, that factor was important to me as well, which is one of the reasons I chose dasBlog over .TEXT.</p><p>Of course, what's funny about investing so much time thinking about the blog template is that I think most people read the site via RSS, not HTML. Chris Anderson of "The Long Tail" <a href="http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/blog_design_in_.html">wrote about this</a> a while back. Maybe I should invest a little effort into the new <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblogce">dasBlog Community Edition</a> effort - I'd like to see the number of times the RSS feed is downloaded vs. the number of times the home page is downloaded.</p><p>Norman further goes on to discuss the fact that his blog is hosted on Blogger, which of course is now owned by Google. I like his point that "Interoperability and mixed environments is the way the world works. If it is good enough for my customers, it is good enough for me."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started reading <a href="http://www.thenears.com/">The Nears</a> after <a href="http://blog.seanalexander.com/">Sean</a> linked to his <a href="http://www.thenears.com/index.php?p=80">comparison</a> of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/evaluation/devices/default.mspx">Media Center Extenders</a>. Today, there's a great comparison of Media Center Extenders to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/devices/wmconnect/default.aspx">Windows Media Connect</a> devices. Very cool stuff. I'd love to have all my media on a central machine and then be able to listen to or watch it all over the house. The Nears linked to the <a href="http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/index.php">Roku SoundBridge</a> which plugs into your stereo system. Supports wired or 802.11b/g wireless in as well as analog, optical and coax audio out. Controllable via remote control or web app. Of course, what would be truly killer is web services support. Prices seem pretty reasonable. There are <a href="http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/models.php">three different models</a> with the same functionality - the only difference is the size and quality of the display. I think I need one or two of these...</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you're using the <a href="http://beta.toolbar.msn.com/">MSN Deskbar</a>, you might want to pick up <a href="http://www.grc.com">Gibson Research's</a><a href="http://www.grc.com/wizmo/wizmo.htm">Wizmo</a>. Wizmo is a command line tool that provides a grab-bag of tools. Personally, I use it for the shutdown commands. I've mapped several of them to Deskbar shortcut, particularly “shutdown” and “shutdown!”. The exclamation point invokes the “damit” variation that overrides applications and/or device drivers that refuse to shutdown. I know a repave is in the near future when I'm find myself using shutdown! on a regular basis.</p><p>I'm surprised Wizmo didn't make <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/radiostories/2003/09/09/scottHanselmansUltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolsList.html">Scott's Ultimate Power Tools</a> list.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>TechEd Session Triage</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the reasons blogging has been a little light around here recently is because I was prepping for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2005/default.mspx">TechEd</a> Session Triage. Basically, all the <a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/tracks.aspx">track</a> owners figure out what sessions they want on their own then come together for an entire afternoon to present their sessions to each other. Turns out there is often overlap with other sessions in other tracks that need to be worked out, suggesting changes to titles and abstracts and other wise cutting up. For example. I'm sitting next to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rdias">Becky</a> who owns the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rdias/archive/2004/12/07/278006.aspx">Connected Systems Infrastructure</a> track. We had several sessions in both the CSI and ARC tracks that have caused changes and cuts. We actually got the ARC, CSI and DEV tracks got together earlier this week for a "pre-iage" which means today went pretty smooth for the ARC track. Not that it felt like things were going to go smooth running around this morning. Typically, the last 24 hours before triage are a flurry of emails with last minute suggestions. This year - no exception. But now, at least it's done. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tanya, my cohort on the Architecture Strategy Marketing team, has finally - after much promising and subsequent delays - starter <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/wabi-sabi/">her blog</a>. So far, just she's just written a <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/wabi-sabi/Blog/cns!1pr7xQL7OitNcPJpkPBJltuA!105.entry">hello world post</a> where she explains why she named her blog "Wabi-Sabi".</p><p>Of course, long time readers are probably wondering: "Did he just say 'Marketing team'?" </p><p>Yes. Yes I did.</p><p>About two weeks ago, I was re-orged to be reporting to <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/">Norman</a>. While you might expect me to be displeased about this, I'm really ok with it. First off, I was acting as the marketing director for about six months, so the fact that we now have three people doing marketing instead of just me is a huge bonus. Secondly, while I was acting as the marketing director (badly I might add) I was in total firefighting mode - no opportunity to do advance planning whatsoever. Now, I have the opportunity to focus on doing a great job on a few things well (like the <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ceed2cfc-c011-4f39-aa2b-d98f3bfa9be6">TechEd Architecture track</a>) rather than doing just enough to keep a ton of things from completely falling apart. It's taken a while to shift gears, but now I spend more time doing and less time running around like a chicken with my head cut off.</p><p>Finally, my move to the marketing team is inherently temporary. Yeah, it's fun while it lasts and I'm learning a ton, but don't think this is a long term career change. Before it even happened, Adam (head of Architecture Strategy) explained that he expects me to be over on the architecture side of the house "soon". Norman and I have already started planning that transition. </p><p>So get your "<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kpleas/archive/2004/12/15/316136.aspx">marketing slime</a>" digs in while you can! (Apparently, we marketing slime prefer the term "marketing flacks".)</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Welcome to the ranks of Flack-dom, Harry.

Personally, I'd think they'd want a high-end dev/architect like you on a high-end marketing team. Maybe not at MS, but at lots of companies the marketing folks fall down when they get increasingly separated from the real users, real buyers, and real implementers/developers.  Knowing you, I'd think you'd make a great bridge.]]></wp:comment_content>

The team will be taking all future marketing meetings from the Chateau Marmont. Yhea, the slime live well....]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently had to repave my main machine. Among other things I installed <a href="http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&amp;page=byoa/prem">MSN Premium</a> which I use to manage my <a href="mailto:harrypierson@hotmail.com">hotmail</a> and <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net">DevHawk</a> emails. However, this time I installed the <a href="http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&amp;page=features/connector">Outlook Connector for MSN</a>, which enables you to use Outlook 2002 or later to manage your hotmail account. Calendar, contacts, tasks, notes, everything. Very very cool. Now, there's no need to install the MSN Premium client at all...or is there? </p><p>The coolest feature of the Outlook Connector is that it delivers all of my personal hotmail to a totally different top level folder inside Outlook. Does anyone know how to do that for POP3 mailboxes? I tried using Outlook to manage my DevHawk email, but then all that mail gets mingled together with my work email. I want the exact same experience for my DevHawk email inside Outlook as I get for my hotmail. However, it appears that while you can have multiple PSTs, you have to designate one as the new mail delivery location default for <em>all</em> accounts. I.e. it doesn't appear that you can configure this on a per-account basis. I'm guessing the Outlook Connector is overriding this for my hotmail.</p><p>Anyone have any ideas on how to deliver email from two different accounts to two different locations? (Other than the obvious “use rules” - I had issues with that approach.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About fourteen months ago, David Trowbridge of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/default.mspx">patterns &amp; practices</a> introduced me to a guy working in their testing group named Larry Brader. David is one of the primary authors of p&amp;p's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpatterns/html/esp.asp">Enterprise Solution Patterns</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/intpatt.asp">Integration Patterns</a> books. I wanted to talk to David about building a pattern repository and he handed me off to Larry. Little did I know that Larry is an information theorist and was one of the key authors of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/tsp.asp">Testing Software Patterns</a>. Frankly, when Larry gets rolling on info theory, I only understood a fraction of what he's saying. But the parts I do understand about how patterns relate to each other blows my mind.</p><p>Then p&amp;p hired this guy...what's his name?...Oh yeah, Ward Cunningham. I hear he knows a bit about pattern repositories. :)</p><p>Anyway, around this time last year I was having regular meetings with Larry and Ward to talk about this repository stuff. Then stuff got crazy on my end - primarily being the <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=85b10eff-25d6-48fc-aec2-91908449d170">acting marketing director</a> for my team as well as the ARC track owner for last years TechEd. The regular meetings became more irregular and then stopped altogether. That is to say, my involvement stopped - Ward, Larry et.al. kept forging ahead. I heard about how things were going from time to time, but that was the extent of my involvement. </p><p>Last summer, Larry, Ward and David (plus others I've never met) published an article called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/entarch.asp">Describing the Enterprise Architectural Space</a>. (They also did a <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032267019&amp;EventCategory=5&amp;culture=en-US&amp;CountryCode=US">webcast</a> on the topic.) In it, they laid out a way of thinking about how patterns relate to each other and they introduced the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/C/4/0C44F7EB-893F-4048-B2C6-C1C889E06DF1/MOAG_F02.pdf">Enterprise Architectural Space Organizing Table</a> (EASOT for short). That was just the first step. <a href="http://patternshare.org/">PatternShare</a> is next one.</p><p>PatternShare is a community site that brings together the patterns from popular authors - <a href="http://patternshare.org/default.aspx/Home.MF.HomePage">Fowler</a>, <a href="http://patternshare.org/default.aspx/Home.DDD.HomePage">Evans</a>, <a href="http://patternshare.org/default.aspx/Home.HW.HomePage">Hohpe &amp; Wolfe</a>, <a href="http://patternshare.org/default.aspx/Home.GOF.HomePage">GoF</a>, <a href="http://patternshare.org/default.aspx/Home.POSA.HomePage">POSA</a> and <a href="http://patternshare.org/default.aspx/Home.PP.HomePage">p&amp;p</a> - into a single repository. Furthermore, it provides a <a href="http://patternshare.org/default.aspx/Home.EnterpriseArchitecturalSpaceOrganizingTable">dynamically generated EASOT</a> showing all the patterns in the repository and how they relate to each other. Finally, it provides a way to <a href="http://patternshare.org/default.aspx/Home.Community.AddANewPattern">add new patterns</a> to the repository so that they show up in the EASOT. </p><p>Major congrats to Ward, Larry, David and the rest of the p&amp;p folks for pulling this off. I can't wait to see where the site goes from here.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I learned that a friend of mine from high school took his own life. I hadn't spoke to him in nearly a decade, but it was still a shock and very saddening.

There's a memorial for him this weekend in Northern Virginia, but there's no way I can make time to go back east for it. There will be a large number of old friends there, many of whom I haven't seen or spoken to much since high school. It further adds to my sadness that it took the death of a friend for me to both realize the need and have the opportunity to reconnect with so many old friends.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though I'm a happy <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a> customer, I decided to try out the new <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=443134">beta version</a> of <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSS Bandit</a>. Wow, I really like the newspaper view. I wish I had this in Outlook. </p><p>I recently hopped on the <a href="http://www.gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD</a> bandwagon and among other changes I deleted all my mail rules and started over. Previously, I was routing my email to different folders based on if I was on the To: line, the CC: line, it came to one of the team aliases or none of the above. I discovered that I pretty much only keep good track of my main inbox with the stuff that came directly to me. Other stuff just languished, unprocessed. Now, I route mail to folders based on the mailing list it comes from. Some mailing lists have lower priority than others. This newspaper view would be perfect for quickly scanning these low priority mail folders, esp. with the feature to mark all as read when leaving the folder.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When web servers were first built, there was a one-to-one mapping between virtual files (i.e. addressable via http) and the physical files (the ones in the file system). Over time, two important capabilities were added. First, the contents of a given file became dynamic. So while you the reader always come back to default.aspx (or rss.aspx as the case may be) the content changes everytime I post something new. Secondly, the physical file dependency was removed. It's not used much in dasBlog, but in .TEXT this is very prevelant. My <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk/archive/2005/02/01/364380.aspx">last post</a> on blogs.msdn.com is located at http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk/archive/2005/02/01/364380.aspx. Obviously, there is no actual file named 364380.aspx, .TEXT uses the filename as a key into the DB to find the actual entry content. This technique is used extensively in the new <a href="msdn2.microsoft.com">MSDN2</a> (if you haven't already, check out <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/default.aspx">Tim Ewald's</a> MSDN Magazine <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/02/InsideMSDN/default.aspx">article</a> about URL design for MSDN2).</p><p>So now for the funky idea part - why couldn't we generate dynamic local files the same way? I'm not sure I've got a great use for this yet - most of the apps I use are programmable to some extent, so dynamic content can be generated at the app level rather than at the file system level. But I'm thinking there may be some scenarios where it would make sense to do this at the file system. For example, in the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/offers/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;OfferId=74AA1C1D-DFFC-4D91-BC6F-515BE8E59948">Winter Fun Pack</a> there's a new version of the WMP blogging plugin that autoupdates the Outlook and Outlook Express signature files whenever the song being played changes (a la Duncan's Coding4Fun <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun09072004.asp">article</a>). But with virtual files in the file system, you could generate these files when they are accessed instead of writing new ones everytime the song changes, even if Outlook open.</p><p>Of course, our local file system typically has more writing activity than the web, so I'm thinking this isn't that great an idea. But I figured I'd share in case someone else could think of some good uses. Or maybe this already exists and I just don't know about it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Humm i think Linux (i'm sure other unixes have it too) has this, /proc/* for example. But this is done at a kernel level, not sure if such thing exists at the user process level, i bet there is something. But if there isn't i sure it would be an easy hack.

What kind of semantics were you thinking? would these virtual files be seekable? how would they be versioned? what kind of concurrency controls would need to exist? 

Sure pull instead of push (with a lot of unnecessary pushing ocurring in your described scenario) is nice, but i wonder if the effort would be worth it?

just wondering.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree that there are some exciting possibilities for this type of thing, and I use several "virtual filesystems" everyday (Daemontools (for mounting ISO files), web folders (for mounting WebDAV directories)), etc. If you zoom in a little closer, I think you'll see all filesystems are virtual. There aren't actually any files on a disk...just sectors/blocks.

But I think there are some dangers too. I think the assumption that filesystems are fairly static and computationally cheap to access is too baked into most software. I think this goes back to the idea that, "boundaries should be explicit."

If you really wanted to, however, you could make a fairly decent dynamic virtual file system using web folders and WebDAV pointing at a web server.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With their Super Bowl ad yesterday, I guess <a href="http://www.napster.com/ntg.html">Napster to Go</a> is out of the closet. They have some new <a href="http://www.napster.com/compatible_devices/index.html">compatible devices</a>, including the iriver H10 that <a href="http://www.jeffsandquist.com/PermaLink,guid,bd338238-378e-4b28-b026-44cb2e931196.aspx">Jeff likes so much</a>. Alas, my Nomad Zen Xtra is still out in the cold. So far, it looks like only portable media centers and a handful of 5GB players (the H10, Nomad Zen Micro, Dell Pocket DJ, Gateway Photo Jukebox) are supported. </p><p>I'm wondering if older devices will ever be supported? I mean, it's a new protocol and technology, I wouldn't be super suprised if the older devices just couldn't be upgraded to support the subscription service. But if that's the case, I wish they would simply announce it and move on rather than leaving it in limbo. <a href="http://uk.europe.creative.com/support/forums/thread.asp?thre=53365">This post</a> on the Creative Europe forum makes it sounds like the firmware will get upgraded, but with no idea of a date. So, in other words, I don't know when or if I'll get to use Napster to Go to fill up the other half of my 40GB Zen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Typically, my movie tastes are further down the long tail from the big blockbusters. I mean, I'm looking forward to movies like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/">Batman Begins</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304/">War of the Worlds</a>, but usually it's the small quirky films that get my attention. In fact, one of the reasons I'm excited about Batman Begins is because it's directed by Chris Nolan, director of the awesome yet quirky independent film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/">Memento</a>.</p><p>Along these lines, I saw something about a movie from Sundance called <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&amp;id=1808626872&amp;cf=prev">The Aristocrats</a> by Penn Jillette (of <a href="http://www.pennandteller.com/">Penn &amp; Teller</a>). The premise sounds awesome:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>Magician, comedian and entertainer extraordinaire Penn Jillette takes us into the secret world of comedians as we're introduced to a perpetually filthy joke that is never told the same way twice, serving as the comedy equilavent of a jazz solo since the Vaudeville days. All that remains constant is the beginning and the end, and 105 comedians fill in the rest. [From <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/upcoming/">Greg's Previews</a> on <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com">Yahoo Movies</a>]</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Aristocrats has been picked up by <a href="http://www.thinkfilmcompany.com/">ThinkFilm</a>. I hope they get into a theater near me, but clicking thru their site, I don't have a lot of confidence. The only movie currently listed on the site that I recognized was <a href="http://www.goingupriver.com/">Going Upriver</a>, a documentary about John Kerry that I heard about late last year during the presidential campain. Combined with the fact that it will likely be released “unrated” as it would likely get an NC-17 rating for langugage, I'm thinking that I won't see it until it gets released on DVD.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just finished upgrading my blog to the new 1.7.2 RC build. I'm excited about some of the new features, such as the major caching improvements, CAPTCHA for avoiding comment spam, and the new permalinks. The permalinks one is pretty silly, esp. because I pushed for a version that used pluses for spaces. So the permalink for this post will be New+DasBlog+Version.aspx instead of NewDasBlogVersion.aspx. But it's a style thing (I <em>am</em> in marketing now, right?). Speaking of style, I also upgraded the site template and pared down my navigation links. I moved the blogs on that list to a new "friends and family" blogroll. I did add a link to the new <a href="http://devhawk.net/archives.aspx">Archives</a> page, which lists all the posts I've ever made, by category. And I added flair links to add this blog to your <a href="feed://devhawk.net/rss.ashx">desktop newsreader</a> of choice (that supports feed://) as well as to <a href="http://my.msn.com/addtomymsn.armx?id=rss&amp;ut=http://devhawk.net/rss.ashx&amp;ru=http://devhawk.net">My MSN</a> and <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/subscriber/subext.aspx?url=http://devhawk.net/rss.ashx">NewsGator</a>.</p><p>There's still room for improvement. DasBlog still need story support, IMO. Also, I'd like to have a good offline posting experience. None of the existing blog authoring tools work for me since I use crossposts for my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk">MSDN blog</a> (which is what gets pulled into <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture">Architecture Center</a>). I end up writing my posts in FrontPage and then cutting and pasting into the dasBlog web interface. Yuck. </p><p>One quick note - because of the new permalink title support, a set of existing URL mappings on my site started causing internal exceptions. This is because any URL ending in aspx that isn't a file on disk is assumed to be a permalink. Of course, all my existing mappings aren't files on disk nor are they permalinks to blog entries. I changed these mappings from *.aspx to *.ashx to avoid these exceptions and my template and navigation links to match. The only .aspx mapping I left intact was rss.aspx, since pretty much all of my subscribers use that as my rss feed. When I upgraded from my original blog engine, I had to add the rss.aspx mapping to avoid breaking any existing subscribers. Of course, I certainly don't want to break those subscribers now. As a quick and <em>very </em>dirty workaround, I created an empty rss.aspx file in my web app directory. Now, the title mapper doesn't attempt to map to a permalink since there's an existing file on disk. Oh well, that's why this is a release candidate version.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think TechEd 2005 is shaping up to be awesome again this year. They just posted the list of <a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/sessions.aspx">sessions</a> (well, most of the sessions anyway). I can't link directly to the architecture sessions, but you can filter the list to show just one track at a time if you want to. We haven't got speakers or abstracts posted yet, but I can tell you that we've got some good speakers lined up like <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott</a>, <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog">Ted</a>, <a href="http://objectwatch.com/">Roger</a>, <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/WeBlog/">Rocky</a>, and <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/">Steve</a>.</p><p>Of the ARC track sessions, I think I'm most looking forward to "Building and Using a Software Factory". I jokingly call this session "Here's the Beef, Chris Sells". Chris <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1577">blogged</a> that he wanted a concrete example of a software factory. It turns out that we've been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/10/27/248491.aspx">working on a concrete example</a> since before OOPSLA. In the TechEd session, we'll see how far <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/">Michael</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jackgr">Jack</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short">Keith</a> have gotten since October. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is way off topic, but did you ever notice that the characters on Sesame Street that date back to the 70's - Big Bird, Grover, Oscar the Grouch, Cookie Monster, The Count, etc. - are all adults while the more recent additions like Elmo, Rosita, Zoe and Baby Bear are all kids. I'm not sure what it means, but it made me think: Did the makers of the show decide they needed characters that kids could identify with better? Or did the original characters somehow grow up? That's a sorta wacky thought. </p><p>In case you're wondering, Patrick watches Sesame Steet every morning and I have to sit in with him to make sure he doesn't climb out of his high chair.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just got my hands on a <a href="http://www.nomadworld.com/products/zen_micro/">Nomad Zen Micro</a>. That makes four Nomad's so far - I also have a <a href="http://www.nomadworld.com/products/Nomad2c/">IIc</a>, <a href="http://www.nomadworld.com/products/Jukebox_ZenXtra/">Zen Xtra</a>, and a <a href="http://www.nomadworld.com/products/muvo_nx/">MuVo NX</a>. While I like my other Nomads, the Micro blows them all away.</p><p>First off, it's tiny. It may only be 5GB compared to the Zen Xtra's 40GB, but it's also around a third the size. The touch pad is a little funky to get used to, but it sure looks nice. And unlike the Xtra, it pulls power from the USB connector. It doesn't even have a separate power connector - the AC adapter that it comes with actually plugs into the mini USB slot. Cool</p><p>Haven't had it long enough to talk about battery life or the interface, though the interface at first blush seems much better than the Zen Xtra. For example, if you're listening to a song you can jump to that artist in the library. I've wished for that feature many times with the Zen Xtra. </p><p>Of course, the first thing I did was flash the device to the new 2.1 firmware. The 2.x firmware adds support for Plays for Sure subscription services like Napster To Go. And I signed up for my 14 day trial on Napster about 10 seconds after I updated the firmware. I've downloaded about 1GB of music from Napster - I figure that's a good start.</p><p>(Note to Creative - the fact that I got a Zen Micro does <em>not</em> let you off the hook for updating the firmware of the Zen Xtra. I expect to be able to use that with Napster To Go as soon as possible.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I guess there's no real good story for vector graphics in the browser. I know IE supports VML natively, but no other browser does. SVG is the standard, but you need a plugin to make that work in IE and FireFox. Adobe makes an SVG plugin, but who has that installed? Everyone has Flash installed, but that seems like overkill to render a few vector graphics. Avalon would be perfect, except that it isn't shipping yet. </p><p>Does that mean that if I want to build a wide reach website that creates relatively simple data driven graphics (bsaically filled boxes) that I still have to use images? </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>I Give Up On CSS but Not On Flash</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.knowing.net/">Larry O'Brien</a> clued me into the fact that the new DevHawk theme didn't render correctly in FireFox. When I redid my theme, I tried to be good and use all div and span tags, but apparently building a three column layout with a dynamically sized middle column that works on IE and FireFox is beyond my CSS skills. So I went back to using tables. Maybe the folks at <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> would freak out, but the table works just fine.</p><p>Larry also pointed me to <a href="http://activeswf.com/">ActiveSWF</a>, a server side COM component for generating dynamic flash movies. You munge up an XML file describing the movie, hand it to ActiveSWF and it does the rest. Sweet. Only thing missing is a .NET version (I realize I can interop to COM, but that's a pain to deploy).</p><p>Thanks Larry!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Inital Thoughts on Zen Micro and Nomad to Go</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After using the new 2.1 firmware for my Nomad Zen Micro for a couple of days, I can see why they haven't upgraded all their players en masse quite yet. It still has a few rough edges. <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/">Red Chair Software</a>, makers of the awesome <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/">Notmad Explorer</a> that I use to manage my other Nomads, advises that you use the older 1.x firmware "you have a specific reason to switch". Of course, I have a <a href="http://www.napster.com/ntg.html">very good reason to switch</a>. The 2.1 firmware is actually beta - something I think Creative should make a little more obvious on the website (not that I wouldn't have downloaded it anyway). For the less adventurous, the 2.0 firmware also supports Napster to Go and isn't in beta.</p><p>The place where I notice the rough edge the most during song transition. When I push next or previous song, sometimes it happens right away and sometimes it takes 4-5 seconds. It doesn't happen when it's playing back a set of songs - what ever the Nomad is doing (verifying licenses I'm assume) it must do it for the next song before the current song ends, so the lag only occurs when you're jumping around manually.</p><p>That's really my biggest complaint. Napster to Go works really well. They haven't upgraded their help files to the new 3.x version of Napster - for example, all of their screenshots have a separate library function within Napster, but on my machine it just uses WMP's library - but it's pretty easy to figure out. I've configured NTG and WMP 10 to auto sync any Zen Micro with any songs I've downloaded from Napster (about 1GB in the first 24 hours I've used it!). The only complaint there is that autosync works by playlist. If you download a Napster compilation, autosync will transfer the music but not the playlist. </p><p>And that reminds me of a feature I'd like to see on the Nomad (all of them). I want to be able filter the list of album to exclude the ones that only have one or two songs. When you download a compilation, you get around 25 songs from different artists. Great for discovering new music, but it adds a bunch of noise to the list of albums. So why not exclude albums that only have a few songs downloaded?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Another Vector Option - Xamlon Flash</title>
		<link>http://devhawk.net/2005/02/13/another-vector-option-xamlon-flash/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another option besides ActiveSWF is the recently announced <a href="http://www.xamlon.com/software/xamlonpro/flash/">Xamlon Pro Flash Edition</a>. Xamlon is essentially an implementation of XAML the current version of Visual Studio. There's a version for <a href="http://www.xamlon.com/software/xamlonpro/winforms/">Windows Forms</a>, for <a href="http://www.xamlon.com/software/xamlonpro/compact/">Compact Framework</a> and now for Flash. So basically, you can write your flash app with XAML and C#. Apparently, you can also <a href="http://blog.debreuil.com/archive/2005/02/02/627.aspx">code directly</a> to the Flash format, bypassing the XAML layer entirely. I like the idea of using a managed component like Xamlon better than a COM based component. </p><p>My big issue with using Flash is that it's a totally seperate programming environment from the browser. Using VML in IE, you can manipulate the vector objects with javascript. In Flash, you may be doing one thing in the browser and something completely different in the flash movie. That's a pain in the behind. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Thoughts on Factories</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I had a great discussion with the Product Unit Manager (or PUM) of <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/teamcenters/architect/default.aspx">VSTA</a>. She wanted my perspective on a few things related to Software Factories and I figured I'd share some of them here. </p><p>First off, while I appreciate the vision of factories, I'm also focused on the short term gains of automating software construction. Today, most of that automation is in terms of code generation. For example, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John</a> asked the other day if I thought <a href="http://www.mkssoftware.com/products/ly/">Yacc</a> is a software factory. It certainly is a domain specific language! However, I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say it's a factory. But on the other hand, I'm not sure it matters that much if it's a factory or not. When the other <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon">John</a> on my team blogged his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2004/12/17/323889.aspx">thoughts on SOA</a>, he included one I wrote: "Eventually we’ll stop talking about SOA and go back to talking about Architecture". I feel sort of the same way about factories. As long as we're talking about it as if it is something different from what we're already doing, we're not there yet. But if we keep taking steps in the right direction, eventually we'll get to the point where the process of building software doesn't look the way it does today. Sorta the same way that building software today doesn't look like it did pre-.NET, pre-VB, pre-Windows or pre-C++ (I could keep going, but I think you get the point). That's the thing about visions, you never really get there, it just provides a way to keep you going in the right direction. </p><p>Secondly, I think that one aspect of Software Factories that at least I haven't focused on is reusable frameworks. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0471202843">book</a> is called "Software Factories: Assembling Applications with Patterns, Models, Frameworks, and Tools" but I think the focus has been mostly on models and tools. This is partially because of the whole DSL vs. UML flack (quick side note - how about we have both?) and partially because the <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/Workshop/DSLTools/default.aspx">DSL toolkit</a> is the first factory-esque thing that we're shipping. However, DSLs big value, IMO, is to automate the construction of applications built on top of well designed reusable frameworks. For example, the <a href="http://devhawk.net/OOPSLA+Day+1.aspx">OOPSLA keynote demo</a> was a DSL that would sit on top of a UI process framework such as the <a href="http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/uipab.asp">p&amp;p UIP block</a>. But if there is not a good framework, there's little point in having a language. I've pointed out in the past that the big gap to cross for organizations to start using DSLs is the leap from building abstractions to building languages that automate that abstractions. However, that's not really true. The really big gap is the leap from building one-off abstractions to building reusable frameworks of abstractions. Once you have the reusable framework, building the DSL is an easier step IMO. </p><p>Even though I didn't figure out the framework / factory connection until last week, it must have been there in the back of my mind when I was working on the ARC track for TechEd. We're having a <a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/sessions.aspx">session</a> on "Design Considerations for Enterprise Application Frameworks" with <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/">Steve Maine</a> as the speaker.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>"I just tried out Napster to Go with my iMate and while I still am not sure that I like the idea of music rental, but I would pay a monthly fee to Apple if I could get access to any piece of music anytime even if just for a while after using Napster for even a few days.  The software experience needs work, but it is a lot better than I ever expected it to be.  Napster has something here actually, but most people don't realize it yet because Microsoft and the industry is doing a piss poor job at showing just how interesting life can be in this model." [<a href="http://lennpryor.blogs.com/lenn/2005/02/2005_the_year_o.html">Lenn Pryor</a>]</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">While Lenn admits that "Napster has something here actually", I guess I have never understood the issue some people have with "music rental". You don't own the music and you never did. You've always owned a copy of the music. You "rented" the music in perpetuity (that's legalese for "a long ass time") for a flat fee. You can argue that the record labels have kept more than their fair share of said flat fee, but it doesn't change the fact that you never owned anything but a copy.</p><p dir="ltr">Personally, I like the Napster model much better. I am paying $15 a month in perpetuity but I get access to pretty much everything that comes out. Actually, I'm not even paying yet - I'm still in my 14 day trial period. But I've downloaded nearly 3GB so far including a variety of stuff that I was going to buy on CD anyway when I got around to it. Life is certainly more interesting under this model.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I can't help but laugh at such statements.  I keep reminding him that he's never owned any of the movies or music that he thinks he owns.

I think this will be one of the biggest hurdles for the entertainment industry to face - convincing the average consumer of the truth that has been the truth all along.

I for one hope that Napster succeeds.  I'm buying.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Allow me to disagree.

The progression from "unencrypted vinyl and CD" to "encrypted bits and bytes" has meant that we consumers have lost several rights under the law we used to have. The record companies want us to concentrate on what we have, versus what we're losing.

For instance, it's perfectly legal for me to make a copy of a CD I purchase and give it to a friend or family member. (see http://www.musicunited.org/2_thelaw.html#5) In fact, I can buy the latest Eminem CD, make 20 copies, and give it to everyone I know. That's legal. But DRM has taken away this legal right.

Or, more practically, I can purchase a CD enjoy it for a few months, and resell it in a garage sale or something. You can't resell DRM'd music.

Now, if the music companies would provide a service where a music license can be permanently transfered from one user to another, that would restore one of these traditional rights. If they would allow unlimited burning to CD (not all songs do), that would restore one more.

I had this actually happen to me recently. I purchased a DRM'd song that allows me to burn the song to CD 3 times. So I burn it (along with a few others) to an audio CD, and something is just not right with it. The CD didn't burn properly - it's not playing in my CD players. That's strike one. I burn it again, and a few months later the plastic label starts peeling off and the CD is ruined. Strike two. So the next time I burn this CD, I will not be able to burn it again. I almost have to burn it, and then RIP the CD, just to be safe. DRM interferes with my RIGHTS to enjoy the music in the ways I traditionally have.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>"When I stood before you in September, I said NHL teams would not play again until our economic problems had been solved. As I stand before you today, it is my sad duty to announce that because that solution has not yet been attained, it no longer is practical to conduct even an abbreviated season. Accordingly, I have no choice but to announce the formal cancellation of play for 2004-05" [<a href="http://nhlcbanews.com/news/season_cancelled021605.html">NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman</a>]</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">I have blogged about the NHL work stoppage several times - I imagine it's pretty obvious that I place the blame for the cancellation of the season firmly on the shoulders of the NHL players association. I find it interesting that Gary open his comments today with an apology to the fans while NHLPA exec director Bob Goodenow opened his comments today by slamming the league. In fact, when asked if the NHLPA owes the fans an apology, this was Bob's <a href="http://www.nhlpa.com/Content/Feature.asp?contentId=3428">response</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p dir="ltr">"Absolutely an apology to all the fans, and speaking on behalf of all the players up here, they didn't want to be locked out. They didn't want to be not allowed to entertain the fans. Gary owes an apology because he started the lock out. He put all this in motion, and the proposals that these players have put forward, in particular, the roll back, which would have made the league successful in one fell swoop, very serious steps were taken, and, you know, yes, we apologize to the fans for this situation, this circumstance, and the fans can say, what are you going to do about it? Well, we've done an awful lot, we feel, to get to a fair resolution, and unfortunately, it's the other side that we haven't been able to make a contact with, and it's unfortunate that this situation will continue. That's all I can say."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">I guess the NHLPA doesn't believe they owe me - the fan - an apology. Here's my response to Bob's response:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p dir="ltr">Fuck you, Bob. </p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">If Bob really believes that the player's proposal would have made the league successful, how come they didn't accept the league's <a href="http://www.nhlcbanews.com/news/nhl_compromise020905.html">offer last week</a> to try it the player's way, but have a system in place to enforce cost certainty if it didn't work? I'm guessing it's because no matter how many times the Bob refers to one of his proposals as "groundbreaking" than nobody - including Bob - really believes that the 24% rollback would do anything to stem the skyrocketing salaries in the long run. Bob had the nerve to say in his statement today that "During the last CBA, when revenues went up, so did salaries. When revenues eased, so did salaries. As evidenced by recent signings." What a load of bullshit. When revenue growth dropped to around 5% year over year in 01/02 &amp; 02/03, salary growth ballooned to almost 12%. And as for "evidenced by recent signings", I guess Bob is just going to gloss over the fact that reason that salaries has eased recently is only because so many players went unsigned last summer since all the teams realized the lockout was looming. </p><p dir="ltr">Well I guess if I need a hockey fix, my only choice is catching a <a href="http://www.silvertips.com/">Silvertips</a> or <a href="http://www.seattle-thunderbirds.com/">Thunderbirds</a> game.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I <a href="http://devhawk.net/New+DasBlog+Version.aspx">upgraded</a> to DasBlog 1.7.2, I had to create an empty rss.aspx file on disk to fool the Title Mapper (that's the part the handles the new title based URLs) into not looking for a post with the title "rss". I knew that a large number of people read my post via the RSS feed, so I didn't want to break what has been the feed address since DevHawk started. However, I didn't think the atom feed would matter as much, so I didn't bother to do the workaround for atom.aspx. Turns out I was wrong. Atom.aspx was requested nearly once a minute between 11pm and 12am yesterday. I got tired of counting, but I'm guessing that number is even higher during the middle of the day since just over half of my traffic comes from the US + Canada. So I created an empty atom.aspx page to fool the Title Mapper even further.</p><p>Now, will I have to do the same for my <a href="http://devhawk.net/cdf.ashx">CDF</a> feed?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>NHL Players - Do Any Of Them Have Any Common Sense?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>"[H]ow many [people] can actually stand up and shout to the world that they let a BILLION DOLLARS in cash disappear into thin air?</p><p>I couldnt  name one off the top of my head that has lost cash money of 1 billion dollars or more, until today.</p><p><strong>Congratulations Bob Goodenow</strong>, President of the NHL Players Association. You turned down 30 teams paying what would probably average out to 35mm dollars in salary per team for this year. Thats more than $ 1,000,000,000.00 in cash that would have been paid to NHL players this year." [Blog Maverick - <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000837032305/">How to Lose 1 Billion Dollars</a>]</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">I guess it's not surprising that the owner of the Dallas Mavericks sides with the owners. But he brings up an interesting point - the players are giving up money that they will never get back. And it's more than a billion - the final league proposal was for each team to pay a maximum of $44.7 Million. Times 30 teams equals <em>ONE AND A THIRD BILLION DOLLARS</em>. </p><p dir="ltr">Even the league's Feb 2nd proposal, which the players dismissed out of hand, guaranteed the players would receive a minimum of 53% of league reveues. Assuming $2.1 billion in revenue - which obviously the league won't get back to for a long time - means the players would have received over $1.1 billion dollars. </p><p dir="ltr">The players have short careers (I think the average is four years) and are losing much more by not playing than the owners are. Even if you don't believe the owners are losing less by not playing, I can't imagine anyone believes the owners were making money hand over fist - i.e. the way the players are. How much common sense does it take for the players to realize the gravy train is over and forcing the owners to lock them out isn't going to change that fact?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I got a chance to see David Allen present his <a href="http://www.gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> methodology. It really struck a chord with me, in many ways because it's seems like such a basic point. I would describe GTD as a way of dealing with the fact that our brains haven't evolved to deal with the details of modern day life. Face it, our brains evolved in a time when our big concerns of the day were finding food and not getting eaten.  It's just not designed to keep the millions of picky little details that make up life today in order.</p><p>I've only just started reading the book, but I've been trying to apply what I've learned. I haven't reached "Mind Like Water" yet, but I have knocked my inbox down from 400+ emails to 20. I've been taking it slowly - cleaning out all the new stuff plus 10-20 of the backlog every day. I'm doing it on my own - there's a <a href="http://www.gettingthingsdone.com/productDetail.php?id=63&amp;IDoption=20">GTD addin for Outlook</a>, but I just hated it. One of the principles of GTD is to get the stuff out of your head and into a system that you trust. Frankly, when the GTD addin started hiding my email, I couldn't trust it anymore. So instead, I do my own thing with Outlook - heavy on the task list of course. And so far so good.</p><p>Note to self, check out <a href="http://jeffsandquist.com/">Jeff's</a><a href="http://wiki.jeffsandquist.com/default.aspx/GTD/HomePage.html">GTD wiki</a>...</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/wabi-sabi/">Tanya</a> pointed out the other day that having a DVR causes you to watch a lot more TV. Case in point: <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a>. I missed the first three seasons. I never knew when it was on and once you miss a single episode, you're kinda done. Now that I have a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/tv/content/Solutions/Foundation/MSTV_Foundation_Main.mspx">DVR</a>, I've haven't missed any of season four. Furthermore, the first three seasons are available on DVD, so not only am I watching more TV from this season, I'm catching up on previous seasons. We just finished season one tonight.</p><p>[Note - there are some first season spoilers here - not big ones, but some nonetheless]</p><p>First off, there is alot of filler - at least in season one. There are long sequences (the girls escaping from the kidnappers leaps to mind) where there's all this action and suspense, but everything ends up back where they started. Secondly, by the end I thought it was over the top on the amount of resources the bad guys had. I mean, they kidnap his daughter <em>again</em>? Maybe it bothered me more because I watched the whole season over a couple of weeks, instead of several months. Finally, the story flow really feels off - but that's the nature of the real-time format. In a more typical series, there's a slow build towards a final confrontation with a collection of connected yet distinct stories. But 24 is like a single 24 hour long movie, except that it doesn't have a clearly defined 3 act structure. It kust puts the pedal to the metal at around episode four and doesn't let up. That's not as exciting as it sounds - stuff just happens...and keeps happening. There's no time for reflection or anticipation which makes it much more difficult to enjoy the story. </p><p>I realize part of the show's gimick is that it's a full 24 hours. But really, I think the story - at least season one's story - would have been better told in 14-18 hours. Of course, that won't stop me from watching the current season or starting in on season two.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>24 Does Use A Three Act Structure</title>
		<link>http://devhawk.net/2005/02/23/24-does-use-a-three-act-structure/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday, I said that I didn't think that 24 has a well defined three act structure. On further reflection, I'm not sure I was correct. I'm used to seeing these three act structure within a single episode and I don't think most episodes of 24 follow that model. However, if you look at the season as a whole, it follows the three act structure pretty closely</p><p>[Note - as with Sunday, there some first season spoilers here - but again I'm avoiding the big ones. I also talk about the current season a bit at the end]</p><p>Typically, the <a href="http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/pruter/film/threeact.htm">three act structure</a> divides the story into three parts - Setup, Confrontaion and Resolution. Each of these parts is deliniated with a plot point - some type of major reversal in the story. In a story as long as a season of 24, these reversals take a much more screen time than I'm used to. To take Star Wars as an example, the first reversal is when Luke discovers his parents have been murdered and he decides to go with Obi-Wan. That's one scene - takes up a couple of minutes of screen time at most. But in 24, the first reversal is the last 20 minutes of Episode 6: Jack is comproised by the bad guys who have his daughter, it's revealed that his wife is with one of the bad guys, the guy that kidnapped Jack's daughter realizes what a bad situation he's in and Palmer decides to tell the world about the death of his daughter's rapist at the hands of his son that been covered up for seven years. </p><p>The second act is typically a series of cycles - alternating between story exposition and action. For example, the first cycle of the second act builds towards the attempt on Palmer's life at the morning press conference. This goes on typically for half of the overall length of the story and ends in another reversal. To use Star Wars as an example again, the second act ends with our heroes returning to the rebel base with the Death Star's plans while being tracked by the Empire. In 24, while the end of the first act ends is very clear and occurs exactly at the one quarter mark, act two runs a little long and has a muddier ending. Personally, I'd say it ends in the middle of episode 19, with Jack in the underground prison, realizing who the prisoner being kept there is while Palmer is realizing that he can't trust his wife anymore. </p><p>Of course, the third act is where everything is resolved - typically running the final quarter of screen time. You can really see here the major difference between a format like 24 and a two hour movie. I don't think you could reveal a twist as big as the one at the end of the next to last episode of 24's first season in the last five minutes of a 2 hours movie and make it work. But that's the time ratio - every minute of a two hours movie equals 12 minutes of a season of 24. </p><p>If you apply this same structure to the current season of 24, you realize that the we're in the middle of act two right now.  The kidnapping and trial of the secretary of defense was act one - and again act one ends right at the end of episode 6. Jack and CTU realizes the "real" target is melting down nuclear power plant via the override device, Behrooz kills the man his father sent to kill him, Jack's girlfriend's estranged husband shows up and we realize there's a mole inside CTU (I get the feeling this is a running plot point - the CTU spy. I'm guessing that if they've used that every season it's gotta be pretty old by now). I put "real" in quotes because assuming this season follows the same pattern as season one, there will need to be some new "real" target in act three. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I'm playing around with podcasting. The new version of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblogce">dasBlog</a> supports RSS enclosures for local binaries and I'm thinking of adding support for remote binaries. (I'm not sure my friend who hosts this blog for me would appreciate the bandwidth spike from adding downloads of media files. Of course, that assumes people would listen). So far, I'm just listening. My friend <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/">Mike </a>does his <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0141212/">Manic Minute</a> and I guess <a href="http://www.curry.com/">Daily Source Code</a> is the defacto standard podcast. This will be easier when I get my new AUX input installed in my car.</p><p>Listening to 30 minute podcasts like DSC on my Nomad have me longing for WMP's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/knowledgecenter/howto/PlayFaster_how_to.aspx">variable speed</a> feature. I listen to podcasts primarily on my Nomad - the combination of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/mp10/default.aspx">WMP 10</a> AutoSync, <a href="http://www.dopplerradio.net">Doppler Radio</a> and Sean's <a href="http://blog.seanalexander.com/PermaLink,guid,88b882ce-dcad-4311-af2d-15732ba01292.aspx">podcast playlists</a> makes syncing down to my player effortless. But listening to Adam Curry ramble on about <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/02/22#a2852">podcast commercialization</a> for 45 minutes doesn't fit into my communte. However, listening to Adam Curry sped up 1.4x would make a 45 minute show end in just over 30 minutes. But alas, the Nomad doesn't have that feature. Does any player support that? Or does it take more proccessing power than these things are carrying around?</p><p>Note to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/tv/content/Solutions/Foundation/MSTV_Foundation_Main.mspx">MSTV Foundation</a> team - variable speed support would also be a great feature for the DVR. I wouldn't watch 24 sped up, but I might watch the Daily Show that way. </p><p>UPDATE - I neglected to "give props" to <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/">my boss Norman</a> for convincing me to look at this whole podcasting thing in the first place. Given how little spare time I have these days, I'm not sure that I needed yet another hobby. On the other hand, not following your boss's suggestions or giving him props is never good for the career! :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

Both ESPN2 and NBC plan HDTV telecasts once the league returns, though ESPN2 first must pick up its options for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. </p><p>Hockey, like football, is well-suited for HDTV's movie screen-like wide picture, which is five times sharper than conventional analog TV. The league is also excited about the ever-expanding acceptance of HDTV, which saw more than 1 million sets sold recently during the run-up to the Super Bowl. </p><p>[Associated Press: <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/nhl/story/3413102">NHL looking at new rules, becoming HDTV-friendly</a>]</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">At least we have something to look forward to I guess </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>MDA And Software Factories - Separated At Birth?</title>
		<link>http://devhawk.net/2005/02/24/mda-and-software-factories-separated-at-birth/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I went to the monthly meeting of the local chapter of <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/">IASA</a>. I should have also blogged this before the meeting, but I forgot. Sorry about that if you live near the Microsoft campus and wanted to go. Next meeting is on 3/30, so mark your calendars.</p><p>Anyway, tonight's topic was an MDA workshop featuring <a href="http://www.andromda.org/">AndroMDA</a>. AndroMDA is an open source tool for generating primarily J2EE code for *nix boxes using UML and MDA. (To be fair, the speaker - local chapter president Chris Sterling - demonstrated generating C# code as well. Of course, he ran it under Mono on a Linux box.) This provided a great launching point for a general modeling discussion that helped me get a few things straight in my head. Typically, the UML vs. DSL discussion turns religious pretty quickly. However, I believe that people - like those a the meeting tonight - who are achieving practical success with MDA in the real world are doing so by using a <a href="http://www.softwarefactories.com">Software Factories</a> style approach.</p><p>First off, if you look at how most people use UML for MDA, the class diagram appears to be the most dominant model used. When I say "UML for MDA", what I mean is people using UML as a <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/UmlAsBlueprint.html">blueprint</a> or as a <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/UmlAsProgrammingLanguage.html">programming language</a>. While UML has 12 different <a href="http://www.omg.org/gettingstarted/what_is_uml.htm#12DiagramTypes">model types</a>, class diagrams make up the bulk of the modeling effort. (The bulk of AndroMDA code generation works off the <a href="http://www.andromda.org/modeling.html">UML class diagram</a>, though the BPM4Struts cartridge uses Use Case &amp; State models as well) The other 11 diagrams are primarily used for <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/UmlAsSketch.html">sketching purposes</a>. That means you're only blueprinting the structural aspect of your system - which in turn means that all the system's behavior has to be implemented by hand. Now, this is not to say that factories suggests you should only model the structural aspect of your system. However, I think this indicates that most pragmatic users have realized MDA doesn't live up to the hype.</p><p>Secondly, the class diagram that are used have to be heavily adorned with custom metadata - typically in the form of stereotypes - in order to be useful for code generation (i.e. blueprint) purposes. AndroMDA has a set of "cartridges" (essentially, target code generators) such as <a href="http://www.andromda.org/andromda-ejb-cartridge/index.html">EJB</a>, <a href="http://www.andromda.org/andromda-hibernate-cartridge/index.html">Hibernate</a> and <a href="http://www.andromda.org/andromda-java-cartridge/modeling.html">POJOs</a>. Each of these cartridges has a supported set of stereotypes. While there is some overlap (for example, EJB and Hibernate cartridges both define the Entity stereotype). These stereotypes assign brand new semantics to the elements being modeled. In short, they turn the the generic class modeler into a domain specific modeler!</p><p>It appears to me that the pragmatic MDA crowd is using the class diagram as a generic "ball and stick" editor. Model elements that aren't needed are ignored and elements that are needed are added via stereotypes. For example, you can use a class diagram to model a database. Certain elements of the model are ignored (Can a column have protected visibility? Can one table inherit from another?) while other elements specific to the domain being modeled are added (primary and foreign keys, indexes, etc). The problem with this approach is that all of the knowledge of how to build a valid model is in the user's head, rather than the tool. Typically, that means a lot of training as well as a lot of in depth understanding of the framework underlying the model in order to capture the right amount of information. Since all that domain specific information is trapped in the users head, they have to do a ton of menial drudge work. It's different drudge work from things like writing tons of data access code, but it's drudgery nonetheless.</p><p>If you're going to need a tool specifically designed for your problem domain, why use a generic tool and a bunch of handwritten rules, when you can codify those rules into a domain specific language of your own? (I mean, other than the obvious "because the <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/Workshop/DSLTools/default.aspx">DSL Toolkit</a> hasn't shipped yet")</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've discovered one thing about my Nomad/Napster To Go/WMP combo that I don't like. Napster is wholy inconsistent when it comes to tagging their music. For example, I downloaded Denis Leary's Merry F'n Christmas album, but half the songs are tagged that they come from the Merry F#%$in' Christmas album. This specific example only appears to be an issue in WMP, but I also had issues with the tagging of Chris Rock's Never Scared album. One song shows up as part of the "Never Scared" album, but the rest show up as "Never Scared [Bonus DVD]". </p><p>I think WMP adds to the difficulty here because of the sheer amount of metadata it tracks. Artist and Album Artist for example. Good idea, but it's really easy for those to get out of sync (check out this <a href="http://msmvps.com/thinice/articles/15229.aspx">website</a> for more info on that). And because these files are all DRM protected, you can't edit the metadata in the file itself, only in WMP's library. But I can't figure out how the metadata &amp; file structure on my computer corrisponds to metadata structure on the Nomad with 100% certanty. </p><p>However, even with that, I still recommend Napster to Go highly. This is a very minor issue that I think highlights a few of the remaining rough edges in a consumer scenario that involved Microsoft, Napster and the media player manufacturer. Plus, I'm anal about things like album names.</p><p>(One other side note - deleteing and rebuilding your WMP library causes all the songs on the device to be retransfered. Woops. Had to reformat the device, but since there's nothing on it but my Napster music, it was no big deal.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/Experimenting+With+Podcasting.aspx">wished</a> my Zen Micro supported variable speed playback for podcast playback. I've got another feature request, this time for podcast recording. The Zen Micro <a href="http://www.nomadworld.com/products/zen_Micro/features.asp">features</a> include built in microphone and support for voice recording. But there doesn't appear to be any way to hook up an external microphone. The built-in mic is fine for leaving messages for yourself, but it's not high enough quality for podcasting "on the go". Additionally, since I'm using WMP 10 instead of the app that comes with the Zen Micro, I'm not sure there's any way to sync the recorded files back down to my PC, but I'm thinking that's just a matter of geting <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/">Notmad Explorer</a> talking to my Zen Micro. </p><p>UPDATE - Sometime shortly after I blogged this, Adam curry <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/02/26#a2979">posted</a> an episode of DSC recorded on a Zen Micro that Sean <a href="http://blog.seanalexander.com/PermaLink,guid,a3fe0c9d-b320-4e08-a1e1-b3ab5426f24b.aspx">gave him</a>. I haven't had a chance to listen yet, but I'm interested in how it sounds and how well it worked for Adam. Do you have to hold it near your mouth the whole time? I still wish I could use an external mic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Bauman left the following <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk/archive/2005/02/24/379473.aspx#379697">comment</a> on my <a href="http://devhawk.net/MDA+And+Software+Factories++Separated+At+Birth.aspx">Separated at Birth</a> post?</p><blockquote><p>The nice thing about using a general purpose modeler is that you can house all of your requirements, use cases, etc. in the same model. Rational provides the 4+1 view, Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect provides several views out of the box that you can easily navigate around... It means that everyone is working off of the same set of rules.</p><p>As soon as you start putting those rules into Visual Studio, they change and deviate from the model. It's true that the AndroMDA does require you to remember to use certain stereotypes, but that's all part of the game anyhow. <br /><br />That's like saying, "well, the GoF patterns are nice, but then you have to remember what it means to have an Observer pattern". Furthermore, UML tools let you customize the list of stereotypes that show in the dropdown, and even the picture that should be associated with those stereotypes. Why mess with some other modeling standard when you can do it all with a proper UML tool</p></blockquote><p>The point I was making is that when you start using the class model to design something other than classes, you're using a domain specific language - even if you're using a general purpose modeling tool.  Take a look at this <a href="http://www.andromda.org/modeling.html">example</a> from the AndroMDA website. Their example reads:</p><blockquote><p>You tag a CustomerService class with a &lt;&lt;Service&gt;&gt; stereotype. AndroMDA sees this stereotype, looks into its internal dictionary of available code generation components (called "cartridges") and finds the EJB cartridge. In the EJB cartridge, two templates correspond to the &lt;&lt;Service&gt;&gt; stereotype: SessionBean.vsl and SessionBeanImpl.vsl. AndroMDA uses the internal representation of CustomerService loaded from the model, calls the processing engine twice, and two output files are generated: CustomerServiceBean.java and CustomerServiceBeanImpl.java. </p></blockquote><p>In this example, classes with the &lt;&lt;Service&gt;&gt; stereotype actually generate two code classes - the Bean and the BeanImpl. But if we were using the class diagram <i>as it was intended</i>, wouldn't there be a one-to-one mapping between a class in the model and a class in the code? As soon as you break that one-to-one mapping, you're no longer modeling classes. A &lt;&lt;Service&gt;&gt; is something at a higher level of abstraction than a class - otherwise it wouldn't take two classes to implement it.</p><p>BTW, I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with this approach at all! I'm just pointing out the similarities between an approach that many people are using to achieve practical results with UML today and what you can do with the modeling tools that Microsoft is building. </p><p>The key difference comes down to tools. Yes, you can use the class diagram and stereotypes to model stuff at a higher level of abstraction like Services and Entities. But putting a square peg in a round hole like that has problems. Since you're not using the tools as they were designed, you have to manually enforce rules that the tool doesn't know about. Sure, you can add some semantics via stereotypes, but you can't take anything away. How easy is it to build a valid class model that isn't a valid service model? Pretty easy. For example, do services support inheritance? Classes do. My EJB is a little rusty, but I don't think beans do. It certainly doesn't make sense for a service to inherit from an entity or vis-versa. Yet, the class modeler will happily let you do this, even though it makes no sense in the domain you're actually trying to model.</p><p>The value of domain specific languages is that have a tool that is specifically designed to model the domain you're working in. If you're designing classes, of course you'd want to use a class model. We have a <a href="http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/clssdsgnr.asp">great one</a> coming in VS2005. But if you're designing services or entities or page flows or whatever else, why wouldn't you want a tool that's specific to the problem at hand?</p>]]></content:encoded>

I suppose you are assuming that the Class Diagram is intended to be used for design purposes. Then, a class diagram could be considered simply as a code visualizer. In this case, what about nxn relationships? Why are they used in class diagramas if they don't have a one-to-one mapping?

I think that the class diagram is usually (or sometimes) used for conceptual modelling purposes, where you are capturing the structure of your domain and not the structure of your software. Then, we need one-to-many mappings for converting the class diagram into software classes.

Anyhow, I completely agree we should use DSLs. In fact we are all using DSLs when we are "intepreting" the semantics of UML (even when we use it without stereotypes) in the transformation from UML to code.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Javier already stated an obvious problem with your diatribe, so I will not go over that again. Although, if you look at elaborationist model driven development, you will see that there are "analysis" classes that are developed from use cases that then fan-out to "design" classes. And these _can_ also fan-out to "implementation" classes, depending on the implementation language...

You also state:

"Since you're not using the tools as they were designed, you have to manually enforce rules that the tool doesn't know about. Sure, you can add some semantics via stereotypes, but you can't take anything away."

Actually, you can...  To continue your example, I can define a profile that restricts the inheritance from "service" classes. This can be done today by attaching an OCL constraint to, for example, a class (and making it the default behaviour).

Now if I were to create new icons for the service and have this type of constraint defined in the profile, I would have a DSL!

Now there are cases where it is very difficult to extend UML to provide correct DSL support, but the example you provide in this post are not likely to convince people who understand how this works. And in cases where UML can not be used, then a DSL building tool would certainly help!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Charles, I'm not sure I'd call this a diatribe, but your point is well taken. I did not realize you can use OCL to constrain the model - in the discussion that we had at the IASA user group meeting last week, that idea was rejected by those that use UML tools in this way as "not working very well". So maybe they're just using the wrong tool. 

Either way, as you point out, you end up with a DSL! My primary point is that how more similar these approachs are than they are different.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I completely agree!!!

Too many people are making up a lot of noise about how these approaches are very different when they are talking about basically the same thing: the need to present people with constructs that they understand at _their_ level of abstractions.

If you can do that on a common base, then you gain the benefit of existing tools. But if the DSL is too complex for that common base, let's not shy away from creating a new tool. The important thing, in the end, is the user's productivity.]]></wp:comment_content>

It's not hockey, but I enjoyed it quite a bit - especially at the end. They had the league commissioner on at halftime talking about expansion. If they had a team in Seattle, I'd go. </p><p>One of the things I liked about Lacrosse is that the players all have to have day jobs. Average NLL salary is apparently around $12,000. Apparently, many of the player's teach for their "day jobs" which impressed <a href="http://techiewife.com">my wife</a> immensely. She mentioned that this is how all sports leagues should be. I couldn't agree more. </p><p>When I lived in LA, I used to play hockey in the amateur league. I haven't played since I moved up due to a variety of reasons - including cost and distance to rink. But there's an <a href="http://arenasports.net/index.php?action=arena_locations">indoor facility</a> where they play lacrosse in Redmond, less than four miles from campus.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[With the NHL talks dead, there's been renewed interest in our local lacrosse team, the Toronto Rock (cheesy name, but a good time), with the last game I attended a couple of weeks ago drawing in over 16,000 fans to the Air Canada Centre.

I agree with all your points, and add some other observations:

1) Unlike hockey, the background rock music does not stop once the puck is in play;  it's played non-stop.

2) Unlike hockey, players are rotated on and off the pitch continuously -- it's rather amazing to watch the orchestration these guys go through.

3) Unlike hockey, the players RUN the length of the pitch several times during play, no coasting, drifting or what have you.

4) Unlike hockey, which is now becoming pansy-fied, lacrosse is full contact with slashing and checking.  Oh, and they wear minimal protective gear -- helmet, some pads and gloves.  That's it.

In short, if you want to see a real man's game, see lacrosse.  It kicks! :D]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm trying to set up a community site for some old friends from high school. Got the domain name, got the hosting space, just need to figure out what to run on the site. </p><p>I started by looking the old IBuySpy portal. It's been a while - it's now called the <a href="http://www.ibuyspy.com/PortalStarterKit/DesktopDefault.aspx">ASP.NET Portal Starter Kit</a>. Looks as good as it did when it first came out. However, there's a slight security issue. My hoster doesn't allow unauthenticated write access to the file system. Most of the ASP.NET Portal data is stored in the database, however the actual site layout is stored in an <a href="http://www.ibuyspy.com/PortalStarterKit/sourceviewer/srcview.aspx?path=webconfig.src&amp;file=PortalCfg.xml&amp;rows=2">on-disk XML file</a>. I could work around this by setting up a portal on my local machine, building out the site, and then uploading the relevant xml file, but I want to have my good friend back east help manage the site, so that workaround does't work too well.</p><p>Next choice was <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a>. They're about to release their 3.0 version (3.0.11 is supposed to be the final beta). Looks really nice and installed very easily on my local testbed. However, my hoster also doesn't give my DB account owner rights - I get reader, writer, DDL and security admin but not owner. DNN installs a series of stored procedures (which works on my machine due to having DDL permissions) but doesn't give EXEC permissions to those procs to anyone except DBO. Woops. I wrote a small utility app that extracts a list of all user stored procs and calls "GRANT EXEC ON &lt;&lt;SPNAME&gt;&gt; TO PUBLIC" on each one. Seems to work fine, but given the size of the DNN codebase, I'm not sure I'm comfortable that there isn't something else out there that's expecting DBO permissions.</p><p>Assuming I don't go with ASP.NET Portal or DNN, what other choices do I have? I've got pretty stringint security requirements, plus it has to use ASP.NET (go figure). I'm still looking at:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.rainbowportal.net">Rainbow Portal</a> - similar to DNN in that it started from the original ASP.NET Portal source code</li><li><a href="http://asp.net/StarterKits/StarterKitRedirect.aspx?Item=CommunityLive">ASP.NET Community Starter Kit</a> (CSK) - A baseline starter kit for building a community oriented site. Sounds promising.</li><li><a href="http://gotcommunitynet.com/">GotCommunityNet</a> - derivative of the community starter kit. They bill themselves as CSK 1.1. Sounds even more promising.</li></ul><p>Any other suggestions?</p>]]></content:encoded>

I like www.communityserver.org but I went for a wiki instead (www.flexwiki.com). I like the idea of people being able to edit their own pages and extend the site as they want. 

No idea how it will turn out though. I have only written my page and some "plumbing" pages using WikiTalk that allows people to find each other by year, by name and by project.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to listen to my Nomad in my car. Turns out you can get a cable that plugs into the CD Changer port on the back of the stock stereo in my 2001 Chevy Blazer that converts it to an RCA jack for only $60. Add a $5 miniplug to RCA cable and I figured I was golden. That is, until I tried to install it.</p><p>A comedian named Rida Rutner once said she "only like cars because they take me to clothes". I'm not a big fan of clothes, but I don't like cars much either (I only like care because they take me to Fry's?). Apparently, this simple sounding DIY project of "plug in cable" requires the disassembling of half the car. Well, half the dashboard anyway. I didn't realy expect that removing the radio would require "releas[ing] the park brake release cable from the park brake lever". Wow. </p><p>Of course, in my area of expertise I guess most non-experts would be equally lost. I'm setting up a website for some friends, so I sent them a quick email with the status, and the response came back "could you write this again, but this time in English?" :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Modeling vs. Visualization</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.dsic.upv.es/~jmunoz">Javier</a> got me thinking when he left a <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView.aspx?guid=0b5ae99e-f851-4a35-bc55-ad9912559622">comment</a> to my square peg model post. I'll get to intended semantics of class diagrams in another post, but I wanted respond to the latter part of the following comment:</p><blockquote><p>I suppose you are assuming that the Class Diagram is intended to be used for design purposes. Then, a class diagram could be considered simply as a code visualizer. </p></blockquote><p>That's a great point that ties into something I've been thinking about lately: the Class Designer in VS2005 is not a modeling tool, it's a visualization tool. For me, the difference comes down to abstraction and transformation. In VS2005, the Class Designer is built on top of the same metamodel as the underlying language. This means there is no transformation and that the diagram and the text of the code itself are at exactly the same level of abstraction. To me, you're not modeling unless you've raised the level of abstraction. </p><p>However, while I think VS2005's class diagram is a visualization, I also believe that UML's class diagram is a model. UML is not built on the same metamodel as the underlying language. It's at a slightly higher level of abstraction. That's why you can generate Java, C++, Ruby or C# from a given class model. That transformation step between diagram and code is what makes UML a model. Granted, the class model of UML is intentionally close in abstraction to the code, but it's still an abstraction. </p><p>The only reason it matters IMO if a given diagram is a model or a visualization is to be explicit about the need for transformation. And even the need or lack of transformation is only important for usage purposes. Each method has its pros and cons. UML can't model C# code as precisely as VS2005 can visualize it, but VS2005 can't be used to generate code for non .NET languages.</p><p>Javier's point cuts right to the idea that modeling classes "for design purposes" isn't particularly valuable as classes are such a low level abstraction. I think that's why so many people use UML's class model as a general purpose "thing" designer. The question is, what was the class diagrams intended use? </p>]]></content:encoded>

He's got two podcasts up so far. The first is a <a href="http://www.ronjacobs.com/podcast/Feb22.wma">discussion</a> with Billy Hollis about smart client architectures. It's pretty short - just enough to whet your appetite. (Quick plug - Billy is presenting with <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/WeBlog/">Rocky</a> on Smart Client Architecture as part of the TechEd 2005 ARC track.) Ron's <a href="http://www.ronjacobs.com/podcast/Feb22.wma">second podcast</a> is with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scottdensmore">Scott Densmore</a> on EntLib's ConfigurationContext. It's cool stuff, but it's alot harder to follow (for me anyway) topics related to code like this with just audio. Luckily, Scott <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scottdensmore/archive/2005/03/01/382650.aspx">blogged</a> about this as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I don't want to just post a link to their blog every week, but if they keep doing stuff this cool I'll have no choice. </p><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/classdesigner/archive/2005/03/03/384156.aspx">Eugene Chigirinskiy</a> could have just posted a screen shot showing tooltips at work in the class designer. But instead, he's built out an HTML image map on top of said screen shot and set up the areas with titles so that as you hover over areas the screen shot, tooltips pop up the same way they do in the tool. Awesome! I have no idea how long it took him to do this, but that's dedication!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/DIY+Car+Radio+Harder+Than+I+Thought.aspx">tried in vain</a> to install a <a href="http://www.pie.net/index-2-details.cfm?recordID=GM9-AUX">PIE GM9-AUX</a> in my Chevy Blazer. The GM9-AUX converts the CD changer port on the stock CD player that came in the car to a standard RCA jack, which I can plug any one of my four <a href="http://nomadworld.com">Nomad</a> media players into (though I imaging 99.9% of the time, it will be the Zen Micro) via a standard miniplug to RCA adapter cable. This weekend, my neighbor Dino helped out and we got it installed. He did most of the dashboard removal work and I did the cable installtion and threading it thru the dashboard to somewhere accessable from the driver seat. Thanks Dino!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Podcast Software Still Pretty Rudimentary</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I'm experimenting with this podcasting stuff. I started by listening to a few podcasts - primarily <a href="http://www.curry.com">Daily Source Code</a> and <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0141212/">Mike's Manic Minute</a> - and using Doppler to pull these down to my Zen Micro. But then I started expanding out a bit - adding <a href="http://www.ronjacobs.com/podcast">Ron Jacobs</a> and <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/wp/index.php?cat=7">Major Nelson</a> - and I started to hit issues w/ the software. Of course, not everyone tags their podcasts with the same metadata style. Given the way the Zen Micro works, I want all the podcasts to have the same genre (i.e. "Podcast") and then have either one song per "album" where the album has the date in the title (preferably in the yyyymmdd format for sort purposes) or one album per artist where the song has the date in the title. That way I can see all the shows from a given podcaster on my Zen Micro in a list and can easily determine the oldest and newest shows. Doppler supports tag overriding for downloaded podcasts - i.e. so I can set them all to have the genre "Podcast". However, their "smarttags" implementation doesn't work at all. You're supposed to use smart tags like %date% and %album% in the tag overrides, if they worked that is. And even the hard coded genre override doesn't work for WMA files. I assume Doppler is using an MP3 specific library for modifying the metadata tags, rather than the Windows Media libraries that work with both. I assume these will get fixed as the tools get better. In the meantime, I've subscribed to the MP3 versions of Ron and Major Nelson's podcast feeds.</p><p>Update - Doppler tag overriding doesn't seem to work for the hardcoded genre either.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Same problems as you are having here.  Doppler's tagging implemenation does not work as other's have mentioned.

I am up a creek right now in trying to get these podcasts to work correctly.  I have the same setup as you with doppler.  I have upgraded the firmware of the zen micro to the 'plays for sure' firmware.

I have followed the instructions for autoplaylists to be synchronized at http://www.jakeludington.com/archives/000408.html

There is one lousy problem.  When I delete the podcast and sync next time to WMP, the shows that I deleted from the zen are re-transferred.

This is obviously a great feature for regular songs, but this behavior of syncing is not working for podcasts.

I am wondering, has anyone found a way to do this?     I"m wondering if those ipods have the sync function in teh new itunes that would work better for podcasts...    The new 60 gig video ipod came out...     I feel a 'justification' reason for my purchase  ;)

It has been noted, and will be fixed in 3.0

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been doing a bunch of thinking about the use of heavily stereotyped UML class diagrams and how similar it is to the DSL approach. I'm working on a new post, but I wanted to parrot <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj">Gareth</a> who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/03/09/391276.aspx">announced</a> earlier today that the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=43636">March 05 CTP</a> build of the DSL toolkit is now available. I'm installing it as I type. Well, not exactly true - I'm installing VC++. This drop apparently requires it. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I guess we're still three months out, but <a href="http://techedbloggers.net">TechEd Bloggers</a> is just getting ramped up. Not to many registered bloggers yet. So far, I'm the only registered blogger in the <a href="http://techedbloggers.net/Bloggers/TechEd2005/Orlando/Staff.category">staff category</a>. Last year, I was staff and speaker (the only track owner also presenting I might point out) but this year I'm in marketing so they didn't let me speak! :) Actually, I picked all the ARC track sessions and speakers, so I have no one to blame for myself. Yep, no one to blame but myself for significantly easing my own workload to only worrying about organizing the track, hanging out in the ARC cabana and hearding speakers (note to self, get <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/">Ted's</a> mobile number before the event starts) without the added worry of having to present. </p><p>Who else is going to Orlando?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/New+DSL+Tool+Drop+Available.aspx">mentioned</a> that you need VC++ installed to use the <a href="http://labs.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/Workshop/DSLTools/default.aspx">DSL Toolkit</a>. Apparently, it's needed for building a DLL related to VS integration. However, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/">Gareth</a> let me know that they should be able to do that with managed code in a future build which means they won't have a dependency on VC++. I didn't install VC++ because I was trying to save space in my VPC where I'm running the VS2005 beta 1 bits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Coming Soon: Xamlon Flash Beta 2</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robin has a <a href="http://blog.debreuil.com/archive/2005/03/11/652.aspx">hilarious post</a> on the upcoming beta 2 of <a href="http://www.xamlon.com/software/xamlonpro/flash/">Xamlon Flash</a>. I started looking into flash a few weeks back for a couple of things I'm working on. I took a quick look at what it takes to build flash movies, but quickly realized I didn't have the personal bandwidth to learn it. However, Xamlon looks like it will give me the ability to work with familiar tools. Robin sums it up this way:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>"Flash users are finally going to have access to good tools. Anyone who tells you Actionscript and Flash are better tools for programming than C# and Visual Studio is on crack"</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">I asked Robin on email a few weeks ago if they saw Xamlon Flash as a way to bring .NET developers to Flash or if they say Flash as just another way to deploy Xaml based apps. In beta 1, it was firmly on the former as you had to write a bunch of flash specific stuff to make anything work. But it sounds like they've almost solved that:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p dir="ltr">We were programming at the swf level...Then another sample came out that was using the early version of our component set. Suddenly the layout is all coming from markup (well not 100%  yet, but very close), as are the graphics. And this markup is Xaml (and in fact could easily be changed to XUL or whatever). Because of this, the code isn't dependant on anything in swf, so hey, it could actually be run on Avalon. The beautiful thing about the markup is it abstracts away the most system dependant things, making it pretty easy to deploy to swf <strong>OR</strong> the native OS. Maybe this is the icing, but that might well be the biggest deal in the end.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">For me, the being able to code to Flash from VS is the critical feature. But it's nice to know that moving to Avalon in the future may been simple or even simply a recompile.</p><p dir="ltr">BTW, check out this pretty cool <a href="http://www.xamlon.com/flash/demos/imageviewer/">photo demo</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usually you use your DVR to watch the show and skip the commercials. Today, however, I did the opposite. Used the DVR to blow thru 58 minutes of The OC to catch the new <a href="http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/">Star Wars Episode III</a> trailer. Pretty cool stuff. As an added bouns, they also had the trailer for <a href="http://www.sincitythemovie.com/">Sin City</a>. I didn't realize Robert Rodriguez was directing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a word, no. The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=57a14cc6-c084-48dd-b401-1845013bf834&amp;DisplayLang=en">March DSL Toolkit</a> requires Beta 1 of VS05 Beta 1 or Beta 1 refresh. However, at some point, there will be a version of the DSL Toolkit that runs on VS05 Beta 2. ("At some point" meaning not on the day that VS05 Beta 2 ships but some short period of time after that.)</p><p>This is why I use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc">Virtual PC</a>. I can install the CTP build in one VPC and the Beta 1 build w/ DSL toolkit in another.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Now, with the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/drives/6908/">PlusDeck</a>, I could actually install a tape deck in a free 5.25" drive bay of my home computer.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I have written several times on this blog, I am using <a href="http://www.napster.com/ntg.html">Napster 2 Go</a> with my Creative Nomad Zen Micro. Unfortunately, the N2G compatible firmware from Creative is still in beta. Everyone in a while...not sure what the repro steps are...the Zen Micro would lose all the N2G music licenses. They've released <a href="http://www.nomadworld.com/downloads/firmware/wma-zenmicro.asp?nProdID=556&amp;sProd=Creative%20Zen%20Micro#wma_download_ZenMicroP4S_PCFW_LB_2_11_02.exe">new firmware</a> (2.11.02) that is supposed to solve this problem. </p><p>However, while the new firmware will eliminate this from happening in the future, it doesn't help you with songs that have lost their license. So you have to delete them off the device and reload them. Simple enough to do w/ WMP10. However, the music you download from N2G has a set of license restrictions, including a limit for the number of times you can transfer it to a portable device per month. I think the limit is three. I've reset my device a few times experimenting with it, so about half my N2G songs had reached their limit. Major bummer.</p><p>However, I dropped a quick email to the folks at Napster and the next time I synced my device, suddenly all the songs had their transfer count reset. So I was able to resync even the songs that didn't work before. I had figured I wouldn't get those songs back until next month, so I decided to download some other stuff to tide me over. Having the older songs transfer was a very pleasant surprise.</p><p>Bravo Napster Support!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talk about transparency: Pretty much everyone involved in the DSL toolkit is blogging. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/">Keith</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jackgr">Jack</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook/">Steve</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/">Stuart</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/">Gareth</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/alan_cameron_wills/">Alan </a>and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jochens/">Jochen</a>. Plus, I bug these guys on email <em>alot</em> and they always have answers. A couple of recent items from these folks:</p><ul><li>Steve was <a href="http://dnjonline.com/article.aspx?ID=mar05_stevecook">interviewed</a> by DNJ Online about Software Factories. I didn't get to read this until yesterday afternoon, but I had to present the Microsoft Technology Roadmap at the Executive Briefing Center yesterday morning. We started talking about factories and one of the things that came up was the massive value of partial classes. Steve hit on this in his interview as well. As cool as yield, anonmous delegates and especially generics are, I now consider partial classes the most important new langugage feature in .NET 2.0. Funny, as it was probably the easiest to build. 
</li><li>Gareth <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/03/15/396453.aspx">blogged</a> about a very strange bug in the March CTP release involving the letter 'A' and a slightly hacky technique for dealing with blank files. He also talks about the model serialization format. Sounds like they'll be fixing both down the road a bit. 
</li><li>Stuart <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2005/03/18/398293.aspx">confirmed</a> that there will be a version of the DSL Toolkit for Beta 2 of VS05 "a small number of weeks" after it ships. He's also talks about some of the features in the next drop: better code generation and better support for containment hierarchies (i.e. classes contain fields and methods). 
</li><li>Keith blogged a software factories <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2005/03/08/389777.aspx">elevator pitch</a> and then refined the definition of a software factory into a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2005/03/17/397957.aspx">single sentence</a>. </li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I met <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/crupi">John Crupi</a> - CTO of Sun's Enterprise Web Service Practice - at OOPSLA last year. Very cool guy. I hadn't realized he started blogging last month until <a href="http://www.iona.com/blogs/vinoski/">Steve Vinoski</a><a href="http://www.iona.com/blogs/vinoski/archives/000153.html">linked</a> to him. There seems to be some disagreement regarding using a top-down approach to SOA. Steve writes that SOA, like other "real-world development" is usually a mix of top-down and bottom-up. John writes that SOA is about a business driven architecture instead of an IT driven architecture. I liked this <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/crupi/20050312#br_br_soa_means_a">quote</a>: </p><blockquote><p>"[W]e cannot do SOA without a mutual effort between IT and the BU. Gone are the days of throwing the requirements over the fence and hoping it hits. Not only do these two groups have to work together, they have distinct roles and responsibilities. Basically, the BU runs the show and owns the business drivers, use-cases and processes. IT implements the BU requirements and owns the service definitions.  It's unfortunate that we really do have to refer to this as a "shift", because we should be doing this anyway. But, the reality is that IT and BU typical function as disparate groups and rarely work together to have the business use-cases drive the process and service definition."</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon">John Evdemon</a> made two <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2004/12/17/323889.aspx">points</a>  relevant to this issue several months ago:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>SOA does not enable or ensure the alignment of IT and business. The IT industry has been promising this for decades – there is no silver bullet for aligning IT and business. Alignment of IT and business is an organizational issue that will not be resolved by an architectural design philosophy alone.</p></li><li><p>Service Orientation will happen in your organization in one of two possible ways: chaotically (typical approach) or in a disciplined manner. The path your organization takes (and the cost of later fixing that path) is up to you.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>I'm with John on this one. Traditional approaches to new problems are rarely successful. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Three Seperate IM Stacks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's interesting to see how consumer and corporate IM have finally started to evolve in different directions. I have a personal IM account (harrypierson at hotmail dot com) on MSN running the newly released <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/">MSN 7</a>. I really like the integration with Spaces, the contact cards and the new Personal Message feature that also integrates w/ WMP and iTunes to show "what I'm listening to" (in case you're curious, baby lullabies - I'm sitting in Patrick's room as he goes to sleep). I hadn't realized how many of my coworkers (primarily ex-teammates) have started blogs on MSN Spaces. </p><p>I also just installed <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/rtc/client.mspx">Office Communicator 2005</a>, the new corporate client for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/livecomm/prodinfo/default.mspx">Live Communications Server 2005</a>. While we've had LCS installed internally for a while, I rarely used it. I mean, the only real value I saw in corporate IM in general was security - if your employees are chatting on IM, better to keep it off the public Internet. But w/ LCS 2005 &amp; new new client, there are several cool new features. First off, LCS 2005 connects with both AOL and MSN <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/livecomm/prodinfo/publicim.mspx">public IM services</a>. So if you want to, add me as an IM contact via my corporate email address (hpierson at microsoft dot com). Next, LCS 2005 &amp; the new client integrate with your Exchange calendar. So if you're in a meeting, you're status changes to Busy. I can also hover on a contact and see what they're up to now (in a meeting until noon, free until 3:30, etc). Finally, the new Office Communicator client integrates with PBX systems. So I can select a conact, hit call, and my desktop phone automatically calls the person. For incoming calls, I get notification even if I'm not in my office. So if I'm in a meeting, my wife calls, I can click on the notification to forward the call to my mobile phone. </p><p>Finally, I'm running <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> (callto harrypierson). I was in Barcelona most of last week and I used the <a href="http://www.skype.com/products/skypeout/">SkypeOut service</a> all the time, except when I was making connections in the Amsterdam airport. I racked up the big 2 Euros in calls over the course of a week. I seem to remember MSN IM having support a similar service via Net2Phone, but they stopped some time ago. I'd probably can Skype if they brought it back. I don't want or need three contact points like this. Two is good - one for work and one for personal - but three is one too many. </p><p>If you want to reach me, you have zero excuse! </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was in Barcelona all last week, so I'm behind on email and blogs. I missed a couple of great posts from various folks involved in modeling at Microsoft. Gareth <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/04/07/marchtexttemplatingsyntax.aspx">blogged</a> about the text template engine in the DSL toolkit. Ali Pasha <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/a_pasha/archive/2005/04/10/406949.aspx">blogged</a> about the relationship between the Distributed System Designers and the System Definition Model.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Certainly not <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/">my father's</a> C++. I sat thru a presenation on VC++ 2005 today. Wow, I hadn't realized all the coolness there.

First off, all the syntax is working it's way thru the standards bodies, so no more <a href="http://msdn.com/library/en-us/vcmex/html/vclrfmxkeywords.asp">underscore underscore syntax</a>. It makes the code somewhat easier to read, but more importantly it's following a similar standardization process to CLI and C#.

Secondly, you can now use all the native C++ features (templates, multiple inheritance, buffer overrun protection, etc) and all the CLI features (garbage collection, generics, language interop) together. Previously, you had very limited choices for mixing the two coding idioms. No longer - go ahead and mix and match. This gives you the best of both worlds. Use templates, and expose them to other .NET languages as generics.

Finally, it brings deterministic finalization to .NET. In VC++ 2005, you can declare both a destructor (used when a class goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted) and a finalizer (used when the class is garbage collected). This is similar to the whole IDisposable approach for classes that wrap unmanaged resources (file handles, network sockets, etc). Actually, it's <em>identical</em> to IDisposable because that's how it's implemented! And it works both ways - if you instance a managed class that implements IDisposable "on the heap" then it will automatically call dispose at the end of scope. For example:
<pre class="brush:cpp">{  //C++ Version
   FileStream fs = FileStream(path, FileMode::Create);
   fs.Read(...);
   fs.Write(...);
}  //fs.Dispose called automatically</pre>
Even though the FileStream is implemented in C#, it behaves here like a stack type and is destructed as you would expect. In C#, you'd have to use a <a href="http://msdn.com/library/en-us/csref/html/vclrfusingstatement.asp">using statement</a> to achieve the same effect. For this trival example, it's not that big a deal. But if you have multiple stack instances created at different times within a scope, this helps out immensely.

Not sure I would move to C++ for all my managed programming, but I'll certainly be giving VC++ 2005 another look.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not that I do a bunch of Office development, but I did build a <a href="http://devhawk.net/Build+Slide+Export+.aspx">pretty nifty utility</a> for PowerPoint a while back. Getting it installed on anyone elses machine, however, was a pain in the ass because while I always remember to install the Office Primary Interop Assemblies when I install Office, I'm fairly certain I'm in the minorty on doing so. So installing Build Slide Exporter was alway tricky. Now, the Office PIA's are available as a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=3c9a983a-ac14-4125-8ba0-d36d67e0f4ad&amp;displaylang=en">seperate install</a>. Not sure if you can redist them, but the readme file that comes with the installer specifically mentions "Wrap the O2003pia.msi in another setup package through Visual Studio or other Windows Installer aware setup editor" so it sounds like they expect it to be redistributed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pedrosilva/archive/2005/04/19/409725.aspx">Pedro Silva</a>, I now know about the <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=61">DSL Tools forum</a> on MSDN. There are also forums for <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=21">VSTESA</a>, <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=63">MSF</a> and <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=62">VSTS Workshop</a>. Plus, you can subscribe to RSS feeds of all these forums. </p><p>Speaking of the VSTS Workshops, the 3rd workshop (after <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/dsltools/default.aspx">DSL Tools</a> and <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/msfagile/default.aspx">MSF Agile</a>) just launched for the <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/sdm/default.aspx">System Definition Model SDK</a>. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/sdmwp.mspx">System Definition Model</a> - or SDM - is the underlying model that powers the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vsts-arch.asp">VSTESA modeling tools formerly known as WhiteHorse</a>. VSTESA models 2 of SDM 4 levels - the Application Designer, the Logical Datacenter Designer as well as the Deployment Designer which essentially models the transformation between the two. These models map directly two the Application and Application Host layers of the SDM. Currently, we don't have modeling tools for the Network/OS and Hardware layers of SDM. </p><p>Barry Gervin recently <a href="http://objectsharp.com/Blogs/barry/archive/2005/04/12/1704.aspx">complained</a> that the Logical Datacenter Designer sucked because you can't model a web and database server deployed to the same physical machine. But in the context of SDM's layers, you model the deployment of multiple application hosts to a single OS instance one layer lower than we currently have modeling tools for. Alex Torone, PM for VSTESA (and presenter for ARC310 - the drilldown on the Logical Datacenter Designer) penned an <a href="http://objectsharp.com/Blogs/barry/archive/2005/04/12/1704.aspx#1829">extensive comment</a> in response to Barry's complaints where he explains why SDM is factored the way it is and confirms that they are working on modelers for the other DSM layers "in future releases".</p><p>Anyway, back to the SDM SDK. What's cool about this is that while we ship some models "in the box" - primarily for our own stuff (SQL, IIS, WS03, etc) - there's no reason you couldn't model any system with SDM (Oracle, BEA, Linux, Z/OS, etc). The <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=46393">SDM SDK download</a> is tools, samples and docs for building your own models and extending the modeling tools in VSTESA. (Note, the actual SDM SDK is a part of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/extend/sdkdownload/">VS05 SDK</a> - i.e. what used to be called the VSIP SDK).</p><p>I wonder how long it is before the community models some of Microsoft's major competitors in SDM?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who's played with the <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/Workshop/DSLTools/">DSL toolkit</a> knows that it's a 50/50 experience. Building the domain model means using a pretty straight forward <a href="http://dnjonline.com/images/articles/architect/mar05_DSL.jpg">designer</a> (itself a DSL). Building a desinger means groveling around in a really ugly XML file. I hear that the designer design experience is going to get better in later builds, but for now it's all hand coding. If you work thru the DSL Toolkit tutorial, you spend a lot of time finding and replacing names of domain model elements in the designer definition file. But now, Modelisoft has a utility called <a href="http://www.modelisoft.com/Dmd2dd.aspx">DMD2DD</a> (i.e. Domain Model Definition to Designer Defintion) that automates all of that nasty find and replace / hand coding. Once you build your DMD, you run their tool and it automatically adds reasonable defaults to the DD for new domain model elements and removes designer elements from the DD for domain model elements that have been removed. The <a href="http://modelisoft.dyndns.org/Nouveau/Dmd2ddTutorial.aspx">DMD2DD tutorial</a> is much more straightforward than the DSL walkthru, since you don't do all that hand editing.</p><p>Haven't tried it yet, but if works anywhere near as well as the tutorial makes it look I'm going to keep a sharp eye on Modelisoft. From their <a href="http://modelisoft.dyndns.org/Nouveau/Default.aspx">homepage</a>, it looks like their primary business is generating and reverse engineering .NET code from/for Rational Rose. I wonder what they're doing w/ the DSL Toolkit?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had a good crowd for today's webcast - including <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/">my dad</a> as it turns out. The session was on packaging design and architecture guidance for Visual Studio. In the session, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/">Tom</a> and Wojtek announced the newest p&amp;p deliverable - the Guidance Automation Toolkit. Frankly, I'm very excited about this project so it was very cool that I got to guest host today's webcast.</p><p>The on-demand version of the webcast will be up soon, and there is no other info available on GAT as of yet, so let me summarize the purpose of GAT. Everyone is very familiar with the template solutions, projects and items that are in Visual Studio today. You select New Project from the menu and you get a choice selecting between things like Class Library, Windows App and Web App. Within one of these application, you get some contextual guidance - if you create a windows app, you get item template choices like Add Windows Form and Add Windows User Control but not Add Web Form or Add Web Service. GAT takes this templating capability to the next level while also making it much easier to develop the contextual guidance.</p><p>In the demo we saw today, Wojtek executed a solution template for a distributed application - similar to ones that come in the enterprise templates feature of VS today. However, the solution template Wojtek demoed has the ability to create the contextual features described above. For example, the solution template created an empty project for the data access layer. From that empty project, you could invoke a project template to create the data access layer. The reason it's important to separate out the step of creating the solution from creating the DAL is that you can ask further questions at this time. For example, you could collect info about what database the DAL connects to. You might even want multiple DALs - one for each DB you're speaking to OK, maybe that's not the best architectural model, but bear with me. The point is that it becomes very difficult to ask all those questions during the initial solution creation step. Breaking it out into separate steps makes it much easier for the developer to tailor the solution as he goes along.</p><p>In addition to having contextual templates that can be executed, GAT projects also have the concept of recipes that can be attached to any node the the solution explorer tree (folders, files, etc). These recipes can gather information from the user in a wizard and then carry out a set of arbitrary actions. In the demo, Wojtek created an entity object within his created DAL project. In the wizard, he pointed it to a table in a database. The recipe then retrieved the schema of the table, executed a template that read that schema, and placed the resulting file into the project. What's really cool is that you can create files that themselves have recipes attached to them. So you could have one recipe that created a baseline entity class from the schema - simply writing out fields and properties for the columns in the table. The create entity class could then have additional recipes attached to it to do things like create insert/update/delete methods or to create finder methods. Of course, often times you want to create multiple finder methods, so you'd want to be able to run that recipe multiple times. Note, recipes can do all sorts of actions - anything that can be automated in VS - so you're not limited to simply creating new files. The create finder method example would need to modify an existing file. You could also delete or move around files as you needed to. It's quite powerful.</p><p>Of course, all this power is useless if it isn't easy to leverage. GAT provides a strong guidance package authoring environment in addition to the guidance usage experience described above. It has several default recipe actions for common scenarios (execute template, add file to solution, etc) plus you can build your own. We didn't get into it in the demos today, but send us feedback and we'll see about scheduling further webcasts to get more info. Additionally, the GAT will be available in a few weeks so I encourage you to get it and play with it when it ships.</p><p>As I said, I'm very excited about this toolkit. It's another small step towards Software Factories. Still have a long way to go, but it's awesome to see tangible progress.</p><p>BTW, there will be both a GAT breakout and hands-on lab at TechEd. We didn't publish the titles yet since the project hadn't been announced. The breakout is being presented by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive">Daniel Cazzulino</a> who has been <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2005/04/20/GATAnnouncement.aspx">working on the GAT</a> for some time now. He's also written the GAT hands-on lab. Watch Daniel and Tom's blogs for more breaking news on GAT.</p><p>Major congrats to Tom, Wojtek and Daniel and everyone else involved on GAT. I can't wait to get my hands on it and start playing around. </p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong> - Looks like the <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032271518&amp;Culture=en-US">on-demand version</a> of the GAT webcast is live.</p><p><strong>ANOTHER UPDATE</strong> - I fixed the on-demand link and removed the live link (since the event's over, what's the point of linking to the live webcast site?)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I try to spend more time writing original content for this site and less time simply pointing at other people's stuff. However, you'll notice the lack of updates around here lately. Things are busy at home - my wife and I are expecting our second child this week! So the dearth of content will continue for now...</p><p>However, while I remain too busy to blog, here are a couple of other new blogs worth reading:</p><ul><li>David Ing's blog <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/">From 9 till 2</a> is a must read. He asked for <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c8e30df7-f420-435c-8b7c-9843e6b4a863">no gratuitous linking</a>, but it's too good to keep secret. Not only does David have valuable insights, he's also funny. Check out his thoughts on <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6011a529-8914-4160-8f2f-0ce7b988310c">SOA Versioning</a>, <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6011a529-8914-4160-8f2f-0ce7b988310c">Domain Specific Languages</a>, <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ec8f632f-54f1-42b3-b5ae-4d63627cb9eb">Smart Clients</a> and <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=75b62342-4864-42c1-ae6d-0326707295af">Wikis</a>. But whatever you do, don't miss his post on the <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d15dc549-22ca-4b2a-bdcf-7d9704d4f34a">Cold War</a> of OO-&gt;SOA, building on Ted's <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20041003#1096871640048">Vietnam War analogy</a> of object/relational mapping. </li><li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wojtek">Wojtek Kozaczynski</a> is an architect for patterns &amp; practices and is heavily involved with the Guidance Automation Toolkit <a href="http://devhawk.net/Introducing+The+Guidance+Automation+Toolkit.aspx">I blogged about</a> two weeks ago.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[HHHuuummm......

This sounds a paraphrasing of my favorite "workplace vindictive":

"Cluelessness":  There are no stupid questions.  But there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.

liberlly stolen from my favorite "workplace attitude adjustment" website:  www.despair.com  (specifically the "workplace motivator" poster at http://www.despair.com/cluelessness.html)

(My second favorite?  Dilbert's website of course!)

I buy the Despair calender each year for my zoo cell...er, cubicle, and I've got a stack of "cluelessness" sticky-notes on my desk ready to write prescriptions for anyone with this affliction...  (Usually, it's a URL, like where to go to get "some stuff" on that Windows operatin' system, msdn.microsoft.com.  DDDUUUUHHHHHH.........)

The hilarious thing about despair.com is that I actually know more than one guy who's lost their job here in Sillycon Valley due to plastering their cubicles with these $15 posters...only to find out how severly humor-impaired some bigwig was...

I just tell them, "You don't REALLY want to work for those kind of jerks, now DO YOU?!?!"

Oh, your QOTD would CERTAINLY qualify as a good example of a "disrespectful" workplace technique...according to the "Respect in the Workplace" mandatory class I had to attend this week.  The mere act of "mocking" someone would get you some demerits or a paddlin' out back...

Keep up the good work!  (And visit Despair.com for more ammo to use against the clueless and other branches of the Homo Stupidien tree of life...)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm still digging out my inbox after my two week vacation. I'm down to 134 items from nearly 400 this morning. I <em>was</em> at 16 before I left. If it gets this bad in two weeks, what's going to happen when I take my four week paternity leave?</p><p>While I'm getting up to date on email, I am way way way behind on blog reading. But I did see that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj">Gareth</a> is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/05/10/416085.aspx">promoting</a> a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/chats/default.mspx#05_0524_DN_VS05">web chat</a> about the DSL toolkit tomorrow at 9am Pacific time. Here's the abstract:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p><strong>Using the Domain-Specific Languages Tools for Visual Studio 2005<br /></strong>Domain-specific language tools lay the foundation for software factories by providing a framework and a set of tools for delivering domain-specific visual designers that plug into Visual Studio Team System. These designers could be tools for industry verticals, such as the health care or telecommunications industries or, they could be tools for development across numerous disciplines, such as object-oriented modeling and architecture. The Microsoft Tools for Domain-Specific Languages is part of the Visual Studio 2005 SDK. </p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Now if we could just get a copy of the <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/dsltools">DSL toolkit</a> that runs on Beta 2! </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm not sounding off in the pub, so I guess I'll blog the <a href="http://www.dsmforum.org/Events/ADDSL05/">workshop</a> that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alan%5Fcameron%5Fwills/">Alan</a> and <a href="http://www.metacase.com/blogs/stevek/blogView">Steven Kelly</a> from <a href="http://www.metacase.com/">MetaCase</a> are doing at <a href="http://www.xp2005.org/">XP2005</a>. It's called "Agile Development with Domain Specific Languages" and here's the abstract:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>This workshop will investigate the application of Domain Specific Languages within Agile development. A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is designed to express the requirements and solutions of a particular business or architectural domain. SQL, GUI designers, workflow languages and regular expressions are familiar examples. In recent years, Domain-Specific Modeling has yielded spectacular productivity improvements in domains such as telephony and embedded systems. By creating graphical or textual languages specific to the needs of an individual project or product line within one company, DSM offers maximum agility. With current tools, creating a language and related tool support is fast enough to make DSM a realistic possibility for projects of all sizes.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coming in June, hot on the heels of TechEd is the <a href="http://www.architecturewebcasts.com/default.aspx?id=8VY6XG9623">Architecture Webcast Series</a>. This is a series of four webcasts in June and July of architectural topics such as service orientation and reusable frameworks. In addition to the valuable content, you'll also get a free <i><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/practices">patterns &amp; practices</a></i> book and get entered into a drawing for a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/portablemediacenter/default.mspx">portable media center</a>. Here are the webcasts:</p><blockquote><p><u><b>Connecting Your Business with Service Orientation<br /></b></u>This webcast invites you to delve into the Microsoft vision for service orientation and service-oriented architecture in enterprise computing. Discover the benefits that service orientation can bring to your business and how service orientation can play an integral role in developing connected systems. You’ll also become more familiar with Microsoft offerings and initiatives in the area of service orientation. And you’ll come away with practical guidance on how and where you should invest in the skills and technologies needed to capitalize on the short- and medium-term promise of service orientation. <br /><i>Live Webcast: 10:00-11:00 A.M. PDT, Tuesday, June 14, 2005</i></p><p><u><b>Creating a Shared Technology Vision<br /></b></u>Increasing business complexity and rapid industry changes are forcing IT and business executives to look for new ways of leveraging technology. Executives must become enablers for strategic innovation and sustainable competitive advantage (top line) rather than just operational efficiency (bottom line). The paths to business flexibility and innovation run through enterprise architecture that can allow companies to decompose their strategies, processes, and technologies into a set of services using proven theoretical frameworks and service-oriented architecture (SOA). Learn more about this effective and simple approach that can bridge the business-IT alignment gap and inspire the creation of the shared technology visions that can power real-time, event-driven network organizations of the twenty-first century. <br /><i>Live Webcast: 10:00-11:00 A.M. PDT, Tuesday, June 21, 2005</i></p><p><u><b>The Value of Reusable Frameworks<br /></b></u>Frameworks provide the building blocks of component-oriented application development through inheritance, abstract types, interfaces, and design patterns. Microsoft and Avanade have been working together to create a set of common application blocks and provide these blocks in an extensible and reusable manner. This joint effort has resulted in the release of Enterprise Library, a set of reusable software components designed to assist developers with common enterprise development challenges, such as Security, Data Access, Instrumentation, Exception Handling, and Caching. In addition, Avanade has extended Enterprise Library with a set of advanced application blocks for implementing Aspect-Oriented Programming and Service-Oriented Architecture called ACA.NET. This webcast will provide an overview of the architecture of Enterprise Library and ACA.NET, and discuss the design patterns that were used to implement the application blocks. <br /><i>Live Webcast: 10:00–11:00 A.M. PT, Tuesday, June 28, 2005</i></p><p><u><b>Examining Enterprise Service Patterns<br /></b></u>The demands you face to produce aggregated views of business information and automate business processes are more intense than ever before. You have to deliver on these demands to assist in the growth of the business while at the same time driving down the cost of IT by commoditizing integration, aggregation, and process management in a complex heterogeneous environment. In this session, we’ll examine a common set of enterprise service design patterns for commoditizing integration, aggregation, and business process management. We’ll consider J2EE, Microsoft .NET and host environments.<br /><i>Live Webcast: 10:00–11:00 A.M. PT, Tuesday, July 12, 2005</i></p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Introducing the Architecture Resource Center</title>
		<link>http://devhawk.net/2005/05/26/introducing-the-architecture-resource-center/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after joining the Architecture Strategy Team, we worked with MSDN to re-launch the .NET Architecture Center. While we've had good success with that site, we realized after running it for several months that we needed a new approach in order to engage architects of all kinds. While Solution Architects are a key audience of ours that is well served by our MSDN site, there are also enterprise and infrastructure architects that we want to be able to engage with via the website. For these audiences, the MSDN site is not really the optimal channel. So today we've launched a new site - the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture">Architecture Resource Center</a> on microsoft.com. We've also re-launched the MSDN site, now called the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/">MSDN Solution Architecture Center</a>.</p><p>One of the key differences you'll notice about the sites is that we have a new way of categorizing our content. Previously, we used a topic based approach with categories such as service oriented architecture and application architecture. Now, we have a taxonomy with categories for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=think">think ahead</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=learn">learn more</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=solve">solve now</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=share">share ideas</a>. This gives us a new way of differentiating content such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/library.aspx?pid=think.integrate&amp;id=http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj2metrop.asp">Metropolis</a>, which really is about the future of architecture, from content such as the <a href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/solvenow/solveimpdes/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/SCAG.asp">Smart Client Architecture and Design Guide</a>, which really is about solving a specific design problems today. Over time, as we add both more content as well as more personalization features, we think this approach will make it much easier for our customers to find the content they are looking for.</p><p>Of course, as "community guy", I'm most excited about the Share Ideas section. In addition to a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/siterss/">site wide RSS feed</a>, we also have an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/aggregate.aspx?pid=share.read">aggregate architecture blog</a> (and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/blogrss/">RSS feed</a>)  featuring both Microsoft architects like myself and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/smguest">Simon Guest</a> as well as and 3rd party architects such as Architect MVP's <a href="http://www.jnsk.se/weblog/">Jimmy Nilsson</a> and <a href="http://objectsharp.com/Blogs/barry">Barry Gervin</a> as well as Architecture Advisory Board members <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/">David Ing</a> and <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/">Martin Fowler</a>. There's info on the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=share.certification">architecture certification</a>, upcoming <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=share.check">events and webcasts</a> as well as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=share.vision.people">profiles of my coworkers</a> on the Architecture Strategy Team.</p><p>Finally, I'm very excited to announce that JOURNAL is becoming <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=journal">The Architecture Journal</a> and that you can sign up for a free print subscription to this great quarterly publication. We saw a huge traffic spike when JOURNAL was introduced on Architecture Center last spring, so I'm thrilled that that great content will now be available in print format delivered right to your home or office! Watch for print copies of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=journal.best.vol1">Best of the Journal</a> issue at TechEd.</p><p>Of course, with any new venture, there will be tweaks, hiccups and improvements. Please leave a comment or <a href="mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com?subject=Architecture Resource Center">email me</a> with your thoughts, opinions and suggestions on how we can continue to improve this site to meet the needs of all kinds of architects. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The May CTP of the DSL Toolkit is finally here, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jochens/archive/2005/05/27/422753.aspx">as per Jochen's blog</a>. The big new feature is compatibility with VS05 Beta 2, but according to Jochen this CTP also includes:</p><ul><li>New features for the model explorer and property browser in the generated designers.    
</li><li>New shape type with collapsible compartments like in the Visual Studio Class Designer. 
</li><li>New text templating (code generation) engine with richer features like an include directive.</li></ul><p>They haven't updated the <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/dsltools/default.aspx">DSL Workbench</a> pages yet, but you get the CTP directly from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=57a14cc6-c084-48dd-b401-1845013bf834&amp;DisplayLang=en">Download Center</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So we're one week out on TechEd. This time next week, the final prep will be done and we'll be ready to let this thing fly. Some of the core team goes down this week, though as a track owner, I'm not really needed on site until Sunday.</p><p>What a difference a year makes. Last year, I was freaking out - it was my first TechEd. Now I feel like the old hand at this. Of course, I wouldn't have made it through last year with out the assistance of a few key individuals. Among others was <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/TechEd05Schorr/">Esther</a>, who just started blogging for this year's TechEd. She's got a <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/TechEd05Schorr/Blog/cns!1prBmci9mgNi52HFewHJdIvQ!105.entry">long post</a> about the track cabanas. Last year, they were a big hit, but there were a few glitches. Esther writes about some of the changes they made this year to address those issues. </p><p>If you're going to TechEd, make sure to stop by the ARC cabana and say hi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The calm before the storm, as they say...</p><p>Things have been quiet around here between new baby &amp; final TechEd prep. I think we're in pretty good shape, though we'll see how we look tomorrow. One good piece of news is that <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/dickcarl/">Dick Carlson</a>, who manages the Hands-on Labs, sent out a list of labs either not received or that have blocking bugs. No ARC track labs on either list. That's a good sign...</p><p>Last night was the track owner dinner at Sea World. Funny, we had a track owner dinner at Sea World last year in San Diego. Is this a trend? It was fun to hang out with the other track owners and drink rather than have to sit around a table and plan. Didn't get to see Shamu up-close-and-personal like last year, but we did go ride the Kraken roller-coaster. Pretty cool, though reminiscent of Batman at Six Flags in SoCal. One slight bummer - some of us waited extra to ride in the front, but I was to big for those seats! And it wasn't a weight problem (though I could certainly use some work on that front), it was a barrel chest problem. </p><p>Today, my pal <a href="http://blahgkarma.blogspot.com/">Chris</a> is driving up from Hobe Sound and we're going to hang out this afternoon. I used to see Chris all the time, but then we both switched jobs and he doesn't have much chance to come out to the left coast. Last time I saw him was at an architect forum last spring in Orlando, when again he drove up to see me. However, I hear there may be a helicopter ride in the cards today, so I'll try and keep the "when are you coming to see me for a change?" grief to a minimum.</p><p>I've even gotten a chance to write up some thoughts on two new projects and to play around with the new DSL Toolkit CTP. Of course, having an <a href="http://www.valence.com/ncharge2.asp">extended battery</a> for the plane ride was the reason I could do all that.</p><p>See you in the cabana on Monday...</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in November, we published a series of articles about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/softwarefactories/">Software Factories</a>. As excited as I am by the concept, <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">Chris Sells</a> really brought me back to earth with this post:</p><blockquote><p>I've been reading each of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/softwarefactories/">the Software Factories articles</a> with great interest. Part 1 and part 2 did a particularly good job describing the elements of the problem space, I thought. However, when I get to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/softfact3.asp">part 3</a>, I was ready to see a solution. Instead what I got was a long abstract piece defining the bits of what makes up a software factory. This is the kind of thing I'd be ready to read after I was shown a concrete example or two of working, running software factories. Do other people like reading these long, abstract articles? I find them tedious unless they're filling in and generalizing the details of something that I've already got a handle on.<br />[Chris Sells - <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1577">Concrete Examples of Software Factories?!?</a> - Nov 7th, 2004]</p></blockquote><p>When we were planning the ARC track for TechEd this year, I sent this post to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/">Keith</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jackgr">Jack</a> and told them I wanted to show a concrete example of a working, running software factory. I wanted to impress Chris. Today was ARC302 - <a href="http://www1.msteched.com/content/sessionview.aspx?TopicID=fb0f790d-a7b8-4948-b3a4-21d000074171">Building and Using a Software Factory</a> with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jackgr">Jack</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wojtek/">Wojtek</a>. I don't think Chris was here today, but if he had been, I think he would have been impressed. It's one thing to see all the various parts working on their own, but it's very different to see everything working together in concert. </p><p>The factory scenario they demoed was for building smart client apps. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/">p&amp;p</a> already has a bunch of existing assets like <a href="http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/entlib.asp">EntLib</a> and <a href="http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/uipab.asp">UIP</a> that is useful for building smart clients as well as a ton of <a href="http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/scag.asp">guidance for building smart client apps</a>. But long books and source code projects are not the easiest form of guidance for developers to consume. The factory ties these assets and guidance together to provide a powerful in-tool experience for building such applications. For example, they started by instancing a smart client solution template. This had two projects - the UIP related code and the main application code. The UIP project had all the boilerplate code that every UIP project needs to use, but it didn't have any code for individual UIP page flows. So they invoked a <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/gat/">GAT</a> recipe to create a UIP page flow. This is one way where factories differ from traditional wizards - wizards are typically only invoked when creating a new solution. Factory recopies are invoked after the initial wizard runs, meaning you can unfold the template incrementally as you go along. So in this case, you invoke the recipe to create a UIP page flow multiple times, once per flow you want to create. Running the recipe created a bunch of files, but of primary note was a <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/dsltools">DSL</a> model file and two code generation templates. The model file was for a cool little DSL for laying out UIP page flows. The code gen templates generated all the code for the forms and the flow control as well as the config needed to implement the page flow as designed in the DSL. Then they wired up the generated forms to a web service, including usign a service agent to cache web service call results on the client.</p><p>All in all, it was a very full featured app to build in a very very short amount of time. What was interesting is that there was very little hand waving when it came to adding code. You know how demos go where they add literally pages of code? In this demo, they'd swap out the file with the empty method for one where the method had like ten lines of code. And on top of being full featured, it followed the best practices design put forth by out patterns &amp; practices group. So it didn't fit the mold of a "quick &amp; dirty" demo - how often does a demo app that you build on stage conform to best practices?</p><p>I gotta get through the end of this week, but then I want to get a video of the demo up on the web so you can see what I'm talking about, even if you didn't go to TechEd or attend the session. I'd love to get the code too - it's all running on VS05 Beta 2 - but you know product group guys...the next version of the demo is going to be even cooler...I think I can convince Jack to ship the current code and then ship the even cooler demo code when they get that finished.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of course, TechEd is a big time for product announcements, new websites (like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/">ARC</a>) and other assorted new stuff. Here's a roundup of stuff I've been tracking:</p><ul><li>TechEd is the first time we're talking about the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/certification">Architect Certification</a> in earnest. There has been quite a bit of cabana traffic on this topic. People hear "certification" and think it's a simple test, but when we explain that it's more like a PhD board, they get more impressed. When they talk some of the people who have been through the beta program and they hear how hard it is, they are more impressed. So far, I think we've only passed around two thirds of the candidates even though the beta program consists entirely of hand selected partners and MSFT employees. <a href="http://www.mariocardinal.com/">Mario</a> made a great analogy to 18th century medicine - certification helped the public separate the real doctors from the charlatans. There's also a great <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2005/jun05/06-06MSLearning.mspx">roundtable interview</a> about the program up on PressPass. Joe from that interview spent a lot of time talking certification in the cabana yesterday. He mentioned that while there is some product focus, a deep Java architect should be able to pass the certification. Good news for Ted who <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20050605#1118010057986">didn't have many takers</a> to sign his book <i>Effective Enterprise Java</i> at the TechEd author signing on Sunday. </li><li><i>patterns &amp; practices</i> launched their new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/">dev center on MSDN</a>. They've also released previews of their new <a href="http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/gbi.asp">Global Bank Integration Baseline Architecture</a> (typically just referred to as GBI) and the <a href="http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/MSWSIBSP.asp">WS-I Basic Security Profile Sample App</a>. I got a preview of the GBI project a few weeks ago, and I was very impressed (though it will be even more impressive if they release it as a GAT package). GBI has lots of moving parts that are headless, so the team wrote an application called The Narrator to help users explore what is happening in the system. It provides multiple views into the running system, including a system view, a services view, a pattern view and a security view. When I saw this, my first reaction was "Let's get that on the web!" I mean, it's great for use with the actual GBI, but GBI consists of 40 projects running across as many as six machines. That's a lot of time investment to simple explore the system. So based on my suggestion, the p&amp;p folks built a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/narrator/narratorstart.html">flash demo</a> of the GBI Narrator. Of course, the flash demo doesn't connect to a running system, but it's otherwise a very similar experience to the "real" narrator. <a href="mailto:hpiersonATmicrosoftDOTcom">Let us know </a>what you think of this approach.</li><li>Lots of other people have linked to the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=74b56c72-7a1f-431f-a29c-58eb39e97a86&amp;displaylang=en">VSTO Outlook</a> that SteveB announced on Monday, but I also wanted to link to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dphill/">David Hill's blog</a>. David is an architect from the Architecture Strategy team, but the VSTO team <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dphill/archive/2005/06/06/425774.aspx">"borrowed" him</a> 3-4 months ago to help make this happen. Watch David's blog for info on what's happening <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dphill/archive/2005/06/06/425786.aspx">under the covers</a> with VSTO Outlook. Congrats David!</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So after doing <a href="http://devhawk.net/Today+Is+The+Last+Day+Of+My+Life+So+Far.aspx">community</a> and <a href="http://devhawk.net/Atlas+Brand+View+Wabi+Sabi++And+DevHawk.aspx">marketing</a> for the Architecture Strategy Team in the last two years, I'm changing roles on the team again. I'm going to work for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John deVadoss</a> as a solution architect. In other words, I'm going to actually do architecture work for the Architecture Strategy Team. Go figure. :)</p><p align="left">Seriously, I've actually enjoyed working for <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/">Norman</a> and with <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/wabi-sabi/">Tanya</a>. This has been in the works for a while and I chatted about it with some of my friends who I saw at TechEd. Someone quipped that I was "getting my brain back". Maybe I'm not getting the whole brain back, but I don't really see it that way. Marketing is very <i>very</i><u><i><b>very</b></i></u> different from technical jobs like development and architecture but it's just as hard. However, it does use a different part of the brain. So while I'm excited to moving into a role that plays to my strength, I'm walking away from my marketing experience with a new respect and understanding for the job. <a href="http://johnporcaro.typepad.com/blog/">John</a><a href="http://johnporcaro.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/reengineering_m.html">wrote about</a> SteveB talking about "selling what we build, AND building what we can sell". I feel that spending time in marketing has made me a better equipped to build what we can sell. Frankly, I think more (all?) technologists should spend a stint in marketing so they understand what it's all about. </p><p align="left">Anyway, I'm still going to be involved in community and Norman considers me a "stealth" marketing technologist (plus, he replaced me with an experienced marketing person) so I guess I'll also do some marketing stuff. So I'll continue to be involved with stuff like Architect MVP and TechEd ARC track, which I've really come to enjoy. But I'll also be involved in projects, doing customer briefings and I've got a bunch of other things brewing. So it should be fun.</p><p align="left">However, before I make the switch I'm going on paternity leave for four weeks first. Ahh, four weeks of rest and relaxation...yeah right. We move into our new house on Monday so I'm looking at four weeks of heavy lifting, sorting stuff in boxes and changing diapers (it is paternity leave after all). I'll try and post occasionally, but I'm going incredibly busy and have spotty network access. I'll probably post pictures to my <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/devhawk/">MSN Space</a> on occasion since I can do that with my phone. Otherwise, I'll see you on the other side.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Speaking of MAAB, thanks for your tenure at the MS helm. Hopefully you'll still be involved in MAAB, but more like David, Maarten et al are involved. Enjoy the time off...]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Real World GAT - NUnit Converter</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk">Jim Newkirk</a> has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/archive/2005/06/24/432485.aspx">released</a> an alpha version of a utility to convert <a href="http://nunit.org/">NUnit</a> tests to <a href="http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/vstsunittesting.asp">VSTS tests</a>. What he doesn't mention in the post is that he's using <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/gat/">GAT</a> to integrate this conversion functionality into VS05. Basically this conversion is an "unbounded recipe" which means that any time you right click on an item in the solution explorer, the NUnit Converter uses Visual Studio's <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ytc6tc9x(en-us,vs.80).aspx">CodeModel functionality</a> to analyze the contents of the file. If the file is a C# file and has any NUnit test fixtures in it, NUnit Converter adds a "Convert NUnit Test Code" item to the context menu. </p><p>From a cursory glance at the code (which Jim was kind enough to send me) it doesn't look like it took very much GAT code to integrate into VS. Of all the files in the solution, there are only three that relate to GAT - the Conversion Action (i.e. the code that initiates the NUnit -&gt; VSTS conversion when you select the context menu item), the Conversion Recipe Reference (i.e. the code that determines if the conversion menu item should be added to the context menu) and the Selected Project Item Provider (i.e. the code that retrieves the selected file from the Solution Explorer). There's also the XML file that defines the recipes. Everything else as far as I can tell handles the conversion itself and has nothing to do with GAT. </p><p>It's cool to see a real-world usage of GAT and that using GAT is a pretty low-impact effort given the VS integration benefits it provides.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a six month silence, <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/">Dad</a> posted about what he called <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/2005/06/business-orient-architecture-boa.html">Business Oriented Architecture (BOA?)</a>:</p><blockquote><p>If I had to guess what a service oriented architecture will eventually look like, I would guess that it would reflect the business architecture – Business Oriented Architecture (BOA).<span></span>Business organizations have evolved over many centuries into a number of common “departments” – sales, accounting, personnel, etc.<span></span>Perhaps that is a good starting place for services.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon">John</a> forwarded me a <a href="http://www.veryard.com/so/2005/06/business-oriented-architecture.htm">post</a> from Richard Veryard where he comments on Dad's post:</p><blockquote><p>The issues addressed in my book are now becoming mainstream as the technological agenda of service-oriented architecture (SOA) starts to converge with the strategic agenda of the service-based business (SBB). This implies an approach to business strategy that involves dynamically managing the geometry of the business. (To achieve a fully adaptive enterprise we typically need to implement a variable geometry.) We can find elements of this thinking in some of the methodologies coming out of IBM and Microsoft, although from what I've seen so far I don't think any of these methodologies go far enough.</p><p>Hal calls this Business Oriented Architecture. If anything, I'd prefer to call it Architecture-Oriented Business. As Hal indicates, this calls for architectural thinking at the business level, which need to be aligned with architectural thinking at the information/software level.</p></blockquote><p>This comes back around to the whole SOA top-down vs. bottom-up argument. Something I'll comment further on when I'm not up to my armits in moving boxes. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got interested in computers when my dad started bringing home a terminal to access his companies mainframe over a 300 baud telecoupled modem. The first terminals were paper-based, then we moved-on-up to a VT100. I got interested in programming because I wanted to be able to build my own game like <a href="http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/">Adventure</a> or <a href="http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html">Zork</a>. The rest as they say is history and some 20-25 years later I work for Microsoft. I never actually built an adventure game, but if I still wanted to, apparently <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog">Rory</a> is <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/15103.aspx">teaching a sesson</a> on <a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org">Inform</a> which apparently is a language for building Interactive Fiction. </p><p>Sounds like <a href="http://pacwest.ms/codecamp/pdx/1/">Code Camp</a> is going to be a blast. Note to self, bug Rory for his slides.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A hobby project which has become more than just a hobby project is our Kid's Programming Language (KPL).  It's a full-featured IDE for kids, including a simplified structured language, and a bunch of entertaining sample programs.  All aimed at encouraging and helping them learn to code, and all built on top of .NET.  It's a freeware download on our site: http://www.ms-inc.net/kpl.aspx, and feedback is more than welcome.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The history of poker in the United States has a bit more consistency. Poker traveled from New Orleans by steamboat up the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. The game then spread via wagon and train. Modifications such as stud poker, the draw, and the straight became popular, during the Civil War. European influence of poker ended when the joker was introduced as a wild card in 1875.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So my time off ended a month ago, but I haven't blogged significantly in over two months. New kid + new job + new house will do that to you. However, I spent the time this morning upgrading DevHawk to the new 1.8 version of <a href="http://wiki.shahine.com/default.aspx/DasBlog/homepage.html">dasBlog</a> and I'm ready to jump back in. </p><p>Back when I was still on leave, my new boss <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John deVadoss</a> this to say about my new job:</p><blockquote><div>Our current thinking is that Harry will focus on two top-level areas</div><ol><li>Being the storyteller (Metropolis, Connected Systems etc) 
</li><li>Changing the way we evangelize Architecture - its not all about n-dimensional frameworks, with m layers of abstraction, about perspectives and viewpoints, with n-layers of capability mappings, and enterprise frameworks up and down the wazooo, blah blah blah. </li></ol></blockquote><p>I loved #2. Architecture is such different things to different people (more on that later) but I thought John's description about what it's <i>not</i> all about was priceless.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>So since one of my jobs is to change how we evangelize architecture, I thought it might be good to get some clarity around that term. I doubt there's a word more varied in definition in this industry than architecture. I often joke is that we call both the person who sets strategic technology direction for the enterprise and the person who decides whether to use a linked list or an array an architect. Maybe it's not that bad, but "architect" does appear to have a wide range of definitions. </p><p>I once moderated a discussion at the Strategic Architect Forum that featured <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> and this topic came up. Fowler's definition of architecture was something along the lines of "The activities on a project that you do first because you think they'll be hard to change". He suggested that asking someone to show you their architecture was a sure way to find out the parts of the project they thought most important or were most worried about. While that's interesting, I think it's harmful to not have a consistent definition of the term across the industry. Everyone knows what a developer does. Nobody knows what an architect does. Well, it seems that way anyway.</p><p>Maybe it's because my degree is in engineering, but much of what we call architecture in the computer industry feels more like engineering than architecture. One of the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=architecture">dictionary definitions of architecture</a> is the "art and science of designing and erecting buildings." <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=engineering">Engineering is defined</a> as "The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems." </p><p>IMO, building a system that has a set of functional requirements (track customers, process orders, etc) and non-functional constraints (sub-second response time, support 10,000 concurrent users, use Microsoft Windows platform, etc) is an engineering problem. Coming up with the lists of functional requirements and non-functional constraints is the architecture problem.</p><p>More on this tomorrow...</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Harry,
I can't say I totally agree that it is the software architect's role to come up with the list of functional requirements. That's what business analysts or requirement engineers do.
The role of the architect is to identify which requirements are important and to surface the significant quality attributes (non-functional requirements) of the system (again, the architect is not the source of the quality attributes but his role is to determine which the most important ones are).
The main point, however, is that I think this is just a small part of the architect’s role. You still need to identify major component, the way they interact and demonstrate how the various quality attributes and main use cases are taken care of by suggested solution. Additional roles includes documenting the architectural decisions,  the responsibility for technology mapping, evaluation of the architecture and making sure that the architecture both followed and correct during the development of the project
 I posted my definition of software architecture  a while ago on my blog (http://www.rgoarchitects.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,6c1fc5b2-5c07-4675-b29d-eb8882cd8715.aspx) which details this further.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Personally, I am listening to music chosen for me by Comcast right now and a combination subscription/buy model sounds most interesting to me. Most music I listen to isn't worth owning. But the RIAA doesn't seem particularly concerned about music listeners.<br />[Robert Scoble - <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/08/27.html//la10971">Om says tough times ahead for Jobs</a>]</p></blockquote><p>Scoble's comment that most music isn't worth owning really resonated with me. I think we can generalize - most <em>content</em> isn't worth owning. Music, movies, books, etc. I find it interesting how the own vs. rent model works in each of these independent forms of media. For example, most people want to "own" their music, but have no problem renting movies. Most people buy books, even though libraries are pretty prevelent, but I wonder if that's more related to availability. How many popular books are at the local library to borrow?</p><p>I hope we see some dovetailing around the rental model across all content types in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rgoarchitects.com/blog">Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz</a> left a <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,1629f5d2-1504-436c-aa43-91419955fb5d.aspx">comment</a> yesterday disagreeing with my characterization of engineering vs. architecture problems:</p><blockquote><p>I can't say I totally agree that it is the software architect's role to come up with the list of functional requirements. That's what business analysts or requirement engineers do. The role of the architect is to identify which requirements are important and to surface the significant quality attributes (non-functional requirements) of the system (again, the architect is not the source of the quality attributes but his role is to determine which the most important ones are). </p></blockquote><p>I'm glad Arnon responded. His blog looks pretty interesting and he's working with Architect MVP <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/">Udi Dahan</a>. Subscribed. </p><p>However, I wasn't talking about architects, I was talking about architecture. That may seem like a subtle difference, but between the wide variance in the definition of architecture and the wide variance in types of companies, trying to figure out a general description of architect across all that variance seems like chasing your tail. </p><p>So with that in mind, here's an interesting distinction between building architects and engineers. I think Pat Helland told me this, but I forget. If you know the origin of this comment, please <a href="mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com">drop me a line</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Engineering is about walls. Architecture is about the space between the walls.</p></blockquote><p>I love that distinction. That leads to my personal definition about architecture in the enterprise and/or software realm:</p><blockquote><p>Architecture is the intersection between business and IT.</p></blockquote><p><i>Most</i> of what I see passed off as architecture lives purely in the realm of IT. For example, as much as I like <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Fowler's</a><a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/books.html#eaa">PoEAA</a>, I would argue that those are engineering patterns as they have little to do with business. If you're building a system for an enterprise, there's a business driver funding that system construction. The business folks don't really care which domain logic or data access patterns you use. <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html">Domain Model</a> vs. <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/tableModule.html">Table Module</a>? <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/tableDataGateway.html">Table Data Gateway</a> vs. <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/rowDataGateway.html">Row Data Gateway</a>? Come on, you think business people care about that?</p><p>If a decision doesn't effect a business person, it's not an architecture decision. I'm not saying it's not important - I think the role of the software engineer is critical in large-scale enterprise system design and construction. And I will readily admit that often a single person is responsible for both architecture and engineering. But that doesn't make them the same activity. As long as we continue to confuse the two disciplines, we hold them both back. </p><p>Tomorrow, who's doing all this architecting?</p>]]></content:encoded>

I certainly agree that an architect 'should' sit at the intersection between business and IT to ensure that the resulting architecture aligns with business requirements and priorities. It's not so much bottom-up or top-down as middle-out. That's why I get so frustrated with much of the commentary surrounding SOA which is largely driven from a software development and integration perspective rather than considering the different types of services which constitute a service-oriented approach to IT.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I said <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/08/31/Architecture+At+The+Intersection.aspx">yesterday</a> that I'm talking about architecture, not architects. However, today I am going to discuss the word architect and the dramatic misuse of the word I see pretty regularly. Or at least, I see now because <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/blogs/">Paul Preiss</a> of <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/">IASA</a> mentioned it when we were hanging out at TechEd.</p><p>"Architect" is a noun, not a verb.</p><p>Usually, when I hear the term "architect" used as a verb, it's being used as a synonym for design. In fact, the term "architecture" is also often used as a synonym for design. For example, Arnon wrote this:</p><blockquote><p>Architecture is design (but not all design is architecture)<br />[Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz, <a href="http://www.rgoarchitects.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,6c1fc5b2-5c07-4675-b29d-eb8882cd8715.aspx">What's "Software Architecture"?</a>]</p></blockquote><p>Like Fowler's description I talked about on Monday, I don't like this one much either. Architecture isn't just "good design" which is what Arnon's description makes it sound like. This begins to get into the title inflation that Alan Cooper <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/vsm/2003_09_14th/magazine/departments/softwarearchitect/default_pf.aspx">wrote about</a> a few years ago. Speaking of Alan, here's his definition of architect.</p><blockquote><p>The panoply of software construction includes three vital roles: the programmer, the engineer, and the architect. The architect is responsible for determining who the user is, what he or she is trying to accomplish, and what behavior the software must exhibit to satisfy these human goals. The engineer's responsibilities are comparable but focused on technology. A good engineer can and should ignore human issues, confident that the architect will cover the human side. </p></blockquote><p>That definition of architecture (i.e. what Alan's idea of an architect does) dovetails pretty nicely with mine. The architect and architecture is the link between the users (i.e. the business) and the software (i.e. IT). The only thing I would change is that as we get deeper into service orientation, interop and connected systems we have lots of process that don't have direct user involvement. So the "human goals" Alan mentions may not be end user goals so much as business / organization goals. Either way, they certainly aren't IT goals. </p><p>As <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dave_welsh/archive/2005/06/01/423984.aspx">Dave Welsh said</a> and <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/">my dad</a> pointed out in my <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,26a8a400-285c-4810-aca7-3ba38a433a01.aspx">comments</a>, Business is from Mars, IT is from Venus. But that doesn't mean they can't get together. In fact, they have to get together. You show me a system with no business drivers or impact and I'll show you a failed architecture. </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I personally prefer the term Architect to be used more like a 'role' than a 'job'. In some (surprisingly very rare) cases it *may* be possible that what you are doing is so very complex that one person takes on that remit as their single and dedicated 'role'. Even then though, due to title inflation, they tend to often make the mistake of not participating in the team with other useful role slices; and then flounder in an alternative reality to the one that actually ships working stuff. 

This is actually odd, as a developer's 'test' their code, even with a dedicated test engineer around, but that doesn't stop them being called a 'developer'; just as TE's do develop lots of code. 

Architects (as a job title) smooze, spec, design, code, test, juggle and can sweep the floor with a party trick involving a broom - it's just an awkward name given to people with a wide remit and depth of experience, and is probably more of a memed organizational positioning term rather than a concrete job description, i.e. L61.

Now, if it is all about positioning and seniority levels then I propose just delisting the word 'architect', call us all 'developers' and then find a suitably horrible word set for people with less experience. About 500 years ago we had 'Serf, Lord, Baron, King' - worth a go again? Would make a great org chart? ;-)

It's a strategy to add customer-driven features and functionality to achieve specific business results while reducing cost and complexity<br />[<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2004/jul04/07-12IntegratedInnovation.mspx">'Integrated Innovation' Provides Partners with Roadmap to Success</a>]</p></blockquote><p>But what about business innovation? How often do we talk about that? Not enough IMO. Especially since the business innovation is much more likely to make or break a company than technology innovation. For example, how did Dell became the dominant company in the PC business? To quote from the Amazon review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887309151">Michael Dell's book</a>: "What makes Dell Computer unique is not what it sells, but rather how it sells it". Usually, people note Dell's direct-selling model as the catalyst for their success. Direct-selling might have been absent in the PC industry before Dell came along, but it's not like direct-selling is a particularly innovative business model. However, what made the direct-selling of highly-configurable computers a reality was the innovative approach Dell took to managing it's supply chain. Quoting from an <a href="http://www.accenture.com/xd/xd.asp?it=enweb&amp;xd=industries/communications/high-tech/case/high_dell.xml">Accenture case study on Dell's supply chain</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Explains Dick Hunter, vice president, supply-chain management: “We now schedule every line in every factory around the world every two hours, and we only bring into the factory two hours' worth of materials. We typically run a factory with about five or six hours' worth of inventory on hand, including work in progress. This has decreased the cycle time at our factories and reduced warehouse space—space that has been replaced by more manufacturing lines.” <br /><br />Not surprisingly, the project has produced more than just enhanced supply chain efficiencies and accelerated, highly reliable order fulfillment. At any given time, there is less than four days of inventory in the entire Dell operation, while many competitors routinely carry 30 days or more. In addition, automation has helped Dell react more quickly to correct potentially out-of-balance situations, made it much easier to prevent components from becoming obsolete and improved response times across the supply chain by providing a global view of supply and demand at any specific Dell location at any time. </p></blockquote><p>Certainly, there is technology innovation involved in the management of Dell's supply chain (and w/ <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/RFIDRetSupChn.asp">RFID</a> on the horizon, significantly more technology innovation in this space is still to come) but the primary innovation here was business oriented. I wonder where the next business innovations are going to be?</p><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John</a> asked  me over lunch if the people who read this blog would think I'm an architect or an engineer. Personally, using the definitions I've laid out this week, my heart's in engineering but I'm getting more interested in architecture. Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels to me that pure engineering problems are giving away to more architectural problems as Moore's law and it's corollaries in network speed and storage space keep pushing out the limits of computing power. Jim Gray &amp; Charles Levine wrote an <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?msr_tr_id=MSR-TR-2005-39">funny article</a> pointing out that Jim's two year old TabletPC with a 1.6 GHz Centrino processor can handle over 8,000 transactions per second. To put that in perspective, in 1976, Bank of America's DebitCredit system reached 100 transactions per second. It took a decade to build a system that handle over 200 transactions per second. Now, most of us are walking around with machine that could easily handle 40 times that performance. </p><p>As Moore's law continues to solve technical challenges, I think it is creating new business challenges. And you know me...I like a challenge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman">Michael</a> cornered me on Tuesday to record a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showforum.aspx?forumid=34&amp;tagid=12">PDC05 Buzzcast</a> with Mike Burner about the <a href="http://commnet.microsoftpdc.com/content/SessionView.aspx?SessionID=524e6b43-dce3-4f4f-b491-3a905c7e5bcd">Architecture Symposium</a>. At PDC03, the Architecture Symposium was one of the more popular and successful aspects of the overall confernece (though it was marred by a major room change issue that caused literally hundreds of attendees to be forced to watch from the hallway outside as the room was literally overflowing) and we're looking to do something engaging again this year.</p><p>Like last time, the Architecture Symposium will be held the last day of the conference, Friday from 8:30 until noon (with breaks of course). After lunch, we'll have a panel discussion featuring <a href="http://www.hohpe.com/Gregor/index.html">Gregor Hohpe</a>, <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/">David Ing</a>, <a href="http://h71019.www7.hp.com/enterprise/cache/119482-0-0-0-121.html">Tony Redmond</a>, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=56393">Steve Swartz</a>.</p><p>Here's the full symposium abstract:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>You've had a tantalizing week of cool technology, but now you need to transition back to your real job: making all of the pieces work together. The PDC Architecture Symposium will zoom you through the solutions lifecycle - from requirements to modeling to requirements to iterative development to requirements to operational feedback (which you might look at as another set of requirements) - showing you how traditional best practices and recent innovations can be used together to build robust solutions that accelerate business value creation. <br /><br /><b>Topics include:</b><br /><em>The Architecture of Connected Systems<br /></em>In the beginning there are the models - from the thing you scrawl on a napkin at lunch to that enormously complex diagram that your network architect carries around in a cardboard tube. What models are worth creating, and how do they relate to each other? Who are the key stakeholders for each, and how can you help them talk to each other? This session explores how to decompose value chains into your key models - your process and work flows, the information at the heart of your processes, and the access, deployment, and other operational models that you need to stay trustworthy and compliant. We will then map these models into a collection of services, orchestrations, and policies that define a highly integrated solution. <br /><br /><em>Building Connected Systems<br /></em>With so much complexity and so many stakeholders, how do you build the right thing on time? This session explores the techniques to iterate agilely through a connected system project, including the patterns and practices for building solutions that combine messaging, workflow, structured information, and human interaction across platforms and across organizational boundaries. How can we give the right access to everyone in the value chain, respecting the very real boundaries around information and process control? How do we keep our models current, and use them to communicate with all of the stakeholders throughout the development lifecycle? <br /><br /><em>Managing the Connected Systems Lifecycle<br /></em>As each iteration of your connected system is deployed and used, new requirements and system refinements emerge. How do we design in the operational hooks that give us the insight to learn from our deployed solutions? How do we re-factor and version our services and orchestrations to improve service reuse, scalability and operational efficiency? The key theme is driving collaboration between development and operations groups from the earliest design phase through the ongoing maintenance of the system. </p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">As Michael said on the buzzcast, you just can't miss the Architecture Symposium. See you there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I spent <a href="http://www.mariocardinal.com/podcast/Show/0003.html">some time with Mario at TechEd</a> talking about the <a href="http://microsoft.com/architecture">Architecture Resource Center</a>, why we designed it the way we did, why we have a site on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture">MSDN</a> and MS.com, how are taxonomy works, etc. Mario then takes my basic explanation and helps fill in more of the details, such as the relevance of the Architecture Resource Center to folks not using Microsoft technology. We also talked about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=journal">Architecture Journal</a> as well as why Microsoft invests in architecture.</p><p>BTW, I make some of the same points about architecture - as it differs from engineering, that it's the space between business and technology, and the effect of title inflation - that I've made here on this blog this past week. </p><p>I guess I need some new material. :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Code Smell Question</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So as a quick break from all this architecture talk, I've got a code smell question. Here's a scenario, I'm interested in feedback on the best way to solve the issue.</p><p>I'm writing some VSTO code for Word using VS05. I want to be able to add and update custom properties on the document. You do this via the CustomDocumentProperties property off the document object. This DocumentProperties collection supports the standard collection type operations such as Add and an indexer. However, it's a little exception happy. If you attempt to access a property that doesn't exist, it throws an exception. And if you attempt to add a property that already exists, it throws an exception. So the first time you set a custom property you use the Add method and then after that you use the indexer to access the existing item in the collection and update it's value. </p><p>Of course, the way my code is written, I want to hide this ugliness behind a method so that the rest of my code can simply set custom properties with ease. However, I want to use the same method regardless if the item already exists in the collection. So what's the best way to implement the method? I can think of two primary ways.</p><ol><li>Attempt to access the custom property via the indexer. If it throws an exception, trap it and call Add instead.</li><li>Manually iterate through the existing custom properties. If the property exists, update it directly. If it doesn't, call Add instead.</li></ol><p>Neither of these is particularly fragrant from a code smell perspective, but which is less odorous? The first one is more direct to write, but since this is all COM interop code, the COM exception is pretty generic. Theoretically, if something else caused an exception to be thrown, I'd still assume the custom property was just missing and swallow the exception, potentially causing an error somewhere else. However, writing the code to manually iterate through the collection just seems excessive. </p><p>In the end, I went with #2 as I was more worried about swallowing exceptions than manual iterating though the collection. What do you think? Was that the right choice?</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think #2 is the preferable solution.

I'd recommend implementing an adapter for the collection wrapping it so you're also not hit by future changes. I've for instance created a CacheManager to wrap the EntLib cachemanager.
Does the COM collection have a Contains or an indexer (IndexOf) to check for an existing item? I would code something like this:

if (collection.Contains(x)) //or collection.IndexOf()
{
  collection.Remove(x);
  collection.Add(x);
}

Trapping for a specific exception can be OK but I would assume the collection internally has to traverse or index the collection to find an already existing item. So this is not the solution IMO.

Have fun!

Harry

However, often when I'm taking pictures of something, I want to record a little voice note so I can later remember some details about whatever I'm shooting. Maybe the place has history, or maybe something caught my eye. Often, looking back at picture I can remember those things, but not always.</p><p>And since I'm asking, I wouldn't mind bluetooth so I could shoot pictures of my kids and send them to my parents via my mobile phone. Sure, the phone has a camera...a crappy one. Fun for <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/devhawk/">my MSN Space</a>, but not for any serious picture taking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I said this was going to be a slow week, so I dug out something I wrote while I was on paternity leave. I was saving it for a rainy day, which is pretty silly since if it was raining I wouldn't mind staying indoors and writing long posts about levels of abstraction, portability and productivity.</p><hr /><p>My <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/">father</a> and I have a running <s>argument</s> debate about the value of platform independence in the system design and development process. As you might guess, as an employee of a platform company I stand firmly on the "platform neutrality is irrelevant" side of the debate. Having been around Bell Labs during the development of Unix and C as well as having done a stint for an ISV, my father is firmly on the "platform neutrality is important". Typically, these discussions turn into childish argument where my father continuously says "what if" and I continuously say "that never happens" and neither of us actually makes any ground on convincing the other of the error of their ways. </p><p>So herein is yet another salvo in the discussion, for your entertainment. It's long and drawn out, but since it's written it means he can't interrupt me to say "what if" :)</p><p>As mentioned above, my father was at Bell Labs in the early 70's when Unix and C were developed. I guess it's no surprise that he harps so much on portability - going back and reading some of the papers that came out of Bell Labs at the time, it's obvious that their culture heavily valued portability. On Dennis Ritchie's <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr">site</a> (the 'R' in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0131103628">'K&amp;R'</a>) there is a wide variety of relevant material including <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/hist.html">The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing System</a>, <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html">The Development of the C Language</a>, and <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/portpap.html">Portability of C Programs and the UNIX System</a>. Given the drastic evolution in computing at the time, it's not surprising that both Unix and C had portability as primary goals. While I jokingly refer to C's portability as "write once, compile everywhere", the reality is that the portability of C and Unix was a key to Unix's success. According to the portability article, 95% of the C portion of the Unix kernel required no changes when they ported Unix from PDP-11 to the Interdata 8/32. Only the core kernel, which was written in assembly, had to be completely rewritten. Even a significant portion of the device drivers ported over to the new machine. </p><p>However, C isn't just portable. It also provides significant abstraction above assembly code. Anyone who has done any assembly work knows how low level it is and how significant the abstraction jump up to C really is. For example, the simple C statement of "a = b + c" requires three lines of assembly code. Here's how Ritchie describes C's level of abstraction:</p><blockquote style="MARGIN-TOP: 5pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5pt"><p>BCPL, B, and C all fit firmly in the traditional procedural family typified by Fortran and Algol 60. They are particularly oriented towards system programming, are small and compactly described, and are amenable to translation by simple compilers. They are `close to the machine' in that the abstractions they introduce are readily grounded in the concrete data types and operations supplied by conventional computers, and they rely on library routines for input-output and other interactions with an operating system. With less success, they also use library procedures to specify interesting control constructs such as coroutines and procedure closures. At the same time, <i>their abstractions lie at a sufficiently high level that, with care, portability between machines can be achieved</i>.  (emphasis added) [<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html">The Development of the C Language</a> - <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/index.html">Dennis M. Ritchie</a>]</p></blockquote><p>That last sentence is key. C's portability derives from raising the level of abstraction. But raising the level of abstraction also had an important productivity impact. Even if you're are only building for a single platform and you don't care about portability, most people would rather code in C rather than assembly because the raised level of abstraction makes the developer much more productive. However, raising the level of abstraction comes with a performance cost. C is pretty 'close to the machine' as Richie put it, but there is still a small penalty. If you're writing ultra-perf sensitive code, sometimes writing in assembly is necessary. There’s a reason why <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/193176932X">books on the topic</a> keep getting written and the Visual C++ compiler <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vclang/html/_core_Assembler_.28.Inline.29_.Topics.asp">supports inline assembly code</a>.</p><p>So here's my point: Raising the level of abstraction is powerful because it can enable both portability and productivity. However, it also typically carries a performance penalty. As long as the portability and productivity benefits outweigh the performance penalty, everything’s cool. The problem is that productivity is typically WAY <i>WAY</i><b><u>WAY</u></b> more important than portability. So abstractions that enable portability without significant positive productivity benefits will not offset the performance penalty associated with raising the level of abstraction.</p><p>The canonical example of "portability without productivity" abstraction that leaps to mind today is the Java platform. Certainly, Java has been pretty successful, though I would argue that its success has been extremely localized. Java on the client has never had mass adoption (the only non-toy Java client app I can think of off the top of my head is Eclipse) and the many of the parts of Java on the server bear a striking resemblance to Microsoft technology. (ODBC vs. JDBC, ASP vs. JSP, Session beans vs. MTS, etc.) Either way, Java adoption has fallen below .NET adoption even though Java had the promise of platform neutrality as well as several years head start. [1]</p><p>I would argue that one of the main reasons that Java has had only limited success is that while Java is portable, it doesn't provide much in the way of productivity improvements. Sure, garbage collection is much easier to program to than C++'s explicit memory management model. But Java's primary competitor (at least in hindsight) was Visual Basic, not C++. While Java focused on portability, VB focused on productivity and in the end it was productivity that drove VB's massive market share. If you were a Java developer, you had worse tools than VB and worse performance than C++ and the only advantage you had was portability which turned out to be more problematic and less important than advertised. Server apps are rarely re-platformed and Java's UI implementation caused as many problems as it solved.</p><p>From a geek aesthetic perspective, you would have guessed that Java with its clean language and programming model would crush VB and COM in the marketplace, but it just didn't happen. VB, with its <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/08/29/The+Most+Popular+Modeling+Environment+Ever+So+Far.aspx">software factory-esque approach</a>, was easier to use and thus attracted more developers who got more apps written. I'd guess that ease of use / developer productivity is the key indicator of success for programming environments. If Java had focused on productivity and portability, I might be working for Sun today. </p><p style="FONT-SIZE: smaller">[1] Obviously, there are varying opinions on this point. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/2005/06-06TechEd.mspx">SteveB said @ TechEd</a> that .NET is the weapon of choice (my words not his) for 43% of all developers. Java was second with 35% and non .NET Windows development was third (no percentage given).  Even if you want to nit-pick on the numbers, you’d be hard pressed to argue that Java hasn’t been losing ground dramatically to .NET in the past three years since VS 2002 RTMed. </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Your point is a good one, but it's harmed by your choice of Java as an example. If you chose server-side development as your benchmark, Java would come out ahead of VB in adoption. Meanwhile, your point on the relationship between productivity, performance, and abstraction is strengthened when memory management is taken as the subject: is the abstraction of managed memory a productivity boost? Absolutely. Is it lower in performance? Yes, when compared to a skilled developer. 

Saying that Java is/was primarily competitive with VB is too revisionist. Java came out at the beginning of the massive wave of server-side / Web development and crushed C++ and Perl as the preferred environment for that type of programming. Java's original APIs included network and threading libraries that were both easier than any others and standardized, creating a perfect little ecosystem of programmers, educators, and business people, all eager to move into this new realm. 

At that point, server-side portability _was_ important because business people _did not know_ if Microsoft would deliver a stable and scalable server OS. In the mid-to-late 90s, hedging your bets over server-side OS choice was a good decision from both a business and technical perspective.

Now, that's no longer an issue and part of the reason that .NET has more momentum than Java is precisely because the /. crowd is the only one left that thinks that MS hasn't proved itself on the server. ]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You have made a perfect point about productivity. In late '90, when first Java app servers came out, most of the server development was either on RS6000 or on Solaris. The only abstractions available were those provided by Rogue Wave toolkits and CORBA IDL. So Java introduced an enormous productivity boost for server applications. 

At the same time, however, it was portability which made Java viable economically for IBM, BEA and others. It changed recurring cost of chasing OS/library versions into much smaller cost of upgrades to subsequent JVM levels. SUN has helped a lot in that area with relatively slow pace of innovation between JDK 1.2 and JDK 1.3.

There is no doubt that portability brings little benefit to developers of business applications. Maybe with exception of programming on Windows/ hosting on Unix scheme. But there would be no Linux and no Java without it.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Larry, while I apprectiate your comments, I have to disagree with some of your points about Java. Java was originally pushed as a client side technology. Remember the failed WordPerfect for Java project? Sun started pushing Java on the server because of the rise of web servers and the failure of Java on the client. 

As for the stable and scalable server OS point, that would be much easier to agree with if the Java server stack wasn't so obviously cloned from Windows. Also, if you include VBScript under the general heading of VB, I'm not sure that Java would come out ahead of VB in adoption. I don't have access to numbers right this second, but if memory serves, there were ASP than JSP sites out there in the late 90's.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After blogging quite a bit last week, I've been to busy to blog this week. Between the Labor day holiday Monday and leaving for PDC tomorrow, it's a short week with lots to do. I'm going to PDC several days early because my family is coming with me and we're visiting friends and family who still live in LA. Patrick is very excited to be going on a "sky tuka-tuka" i.e. "sky train" i.e. airplane.</p><p>Next week will be more of the same from me around here. I'm not going to many sessions - I can get the content on the post conference DVD or simply by emailing the speaker or team directly. PDC is more about hanging out in the community lounge areas the connecting with the other attendees. (Well, that and presenting at the Architecture Symposium.) So I won't be blogging about cool new technology, but you might see the occasional post about a conversation I had with another attendee. Every time I talk to a customer is an opportunity to learn something and expand my thinking, and PDC represents a great opportunity for lots of conversations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm sure lots of people are blogging a ton about PDC stuff, but I wanted to call out two things quickly.</p><p>First is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/max/">Microsoft Max</a>. I have a friend on this team, so I've heard a bunch about this. Given the number of pictures I have taken of my kids, I can't wait to play with this in earnest.</p><p>Second is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/default.aspx">LINQ</a> or Language Integrated Query and it's use in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/future/">C# 3.0</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/future">VB 9.0</a>. I started to write a language a few years ago called Dart (named after my dog) that had SQL-esque commands that were strongly typed. So I'm really impressed with what they've acomplished in LINQ. Not only is it doing strongly typed queries in the lanugage, they even can do joins across stores! In the keynote demo, they joined a query of running processes with data from a database. So now any C# or VB developer has their - or should I say will have their - own query processor around at the ready!</p>]]></content:encoded>

I've got Max running on a clean image, but I know I'll want to reimage it again soon when there's a later drop of WinFX or VS or LINQ that I want to play with. However, Max doesn't have any way to save a picture list to the hard drive. Everything (and I mean everything) is stored in an XML file in the C:Documents and Settings&lt;userName&gt;Local SettingsApplication DataMicrosoftMicrosoft Codename Max directory. Spelunking the code with Reflector, I see a locally defined namespace called System.Storage. I'm guessing this is a stub WinFS library with the intention of migrating to the real deal at some point in the future. But since it's just a stub, there's no simple way to get stuff in and out of that file. I tried cutting and pasting of the XML, but Max told me the store was corrupted and I had to rebuild my photo list. Please add some way to save photo lists outside of Max! 
</li><li>No Downlevel experience. I showed my wife the photo list I built and her first response was "can you send me that?" Sadly, no I can't. I realize that Max is supposed to be an example of the new-fangled WinFX stuff, but my wife, her best friend, my mother, my mother-in-law, etc. are NOT going to install the Sept. CTP of WinFX in order to run Max. Most of the cool Avalon stuff is in the authoring experience. Couldn't you export a photo list to DHTML or something?</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

So basicly it is not suppsoed to be a product. it is a concept to show how easy it is to make avalon applications. you were at the PDC you should know that.
Project M is supposed to be the product. and god only knows what that is.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm feeling particularly geeky having just re-imaged my laptop's dev partion. This is what's running on it so far:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=FFD636F0-86E9-41E8-9E1C-100A4CC4888F&amp;displaylang=en">WinFX Runtime - Sept CTP</a></li><li><a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/get/default.aspx#vsts">VS 2005 Team Suite Beta 2</a></li><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C20CC6C8-1F4E-4A5C-BC79-C2FE9ABE69AA&amp;displaylang=en">WinFX SDK - Sept CTP</a></li><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=EDE1A645-2A53-42E1-8482-3BF1FADADE06&amp;displaylang=en">VS Extensions for WinFX Sept CTP</a></li><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=7096d039-2638-4f63-8654-d2e5d98fa417&amp;displaylang=en">VS Extensions for WinWF Sept CTP</a></li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/WinFS/">WinFS Beta 1</a></li><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=57A14CC6-C084-48DD-B401-1845013BF834&amp;displaylang=en">DSL Toolkit Sept CTP</a> (I hadn't realized a new CTP shipped!)</li><li><a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/gat/download.aspx">Guidance Automation Toolkit Tech Preview</a></li><li><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/7/0/4703eba2-78c4-4b09-8912-69f6c38d3a56/LINQ%20Preview.msi">C#</a> and <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/5/1/F5126EC6-B8EC-440A-852B-7A661D70D637/LINQ%20VB%20(Beta%202)%20Preview.msi">VB</a> LINQ Tech Previews</li></ul><p>Not that this is of much use to anyone, but I thought it was cool. Not sure what I'm going to do with all this stuff yet, but I just had to have it all. I guess the stint in marketing didn't completely wipe out my interest in coding.</p><p>FYI, I have to give major thumbs up to <a href="http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/">Terabyte Unlimited</a>'s <a href="http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/bootitng.html">BootIt NG</a> product. My laptop runs three partitions: Production, Development and Documents. Putting all my docs on their own partition means I can pave the other two pretty much whenever I want. However, Windows XP wants to make the first partition it finds the C drive, even if you eventually choose to boot off another partition. This means I can't create an image from on partition and restore it to the other. What a pain. But with BootIt NG, I can choose which partition to boot and hide whichever of the others I want to.</p><p>I still use VPC for a lot of my dev work, but for Avalon and/or device development - where VPC isn't really practical - having a separate partition for dev work is really helpful. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was at PDC, I saw the Phidgets folks in the Coding4Fun booth. Is it just me, or is this stuff dying to get merged with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/invisible/">MSR's Invisible Computing</a> project? Haven't heard of Invisible Computing? Here's the description:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/invisible/">This site</a> has the source code and documentation for Microsoft Invisible Computing. It is a research prototype for making small devices part of the seamless computing world. This site contains the source code and is available free of charge for research and educational use under the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/invisible/EULA.htm">Microsoft Shared Source License</a>. </p><p>Microsoft Invisible Computing consists of compact middleware for constructing embedded web services applications and a small component based Real-Time Operating System with TCP/IP networking to make middleware run straight on the metal on several embedded processors. </p><p>The goal is to make it easy to build custom smart devices and consumer electronics, especially battery operated; and to support research in invisible computing, operating systems, networking, ubiquitous computing, sensor nets, distributed systems, object-oriented design, and wireless communication. </p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">FYI, I discovered the Invisible Computing project by <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=tinyclr">searching the web for TinyCLR</a>. TinyCLR is what powers the MSN Direct watch. From what I can tell (i.e. this is based on publicly discovered info) is that Invisible Computing is a shared source version of TinyCLR that works with a variety of hardware platforms. Sort of like a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=3A1C93FA-7462-47D0-8E56-8DD34C6292F0&amp;displaylang=en">Rotor</a> for embedded devices. </p><p dir="ltr">Check out a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/invisible/doc/fsummit2004-jvh-talk.ppt">presentation</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/invisible/doc/howto/install.htm">the code</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's hard to believe it October already. The last three weeks have been jam packed, starting with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc">PDC 05</a>, then a variety of meetings culminating with the company meeting the following week, then the <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/MVPSMT2005">2005 MVP Global Summit</a> last week. This was the first MVP Summit to include Architect MVPs so it was pretty stressful. Of course, there were things we could have done better, but all-in-all I was happy with the event. A year ago, we had just awarded our first 14 Architect MVPs. Now we're 100 strong between our <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/communities/mvplist.aspx?Product=Visual+Developer+-+Solutions+Architect">solution</a> and <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/communities/mvplist.aspx?Product=Windows+Server+System+-+Infrastructure+Architect">infrastructure</a> Architect MVPs and we had better than half of them in Redmond for the summit. I swear, it will take us the rest of the fiscal year to implement even half of their suggestions. </p><p>I'm sure each of the various groups that have MVPs think that their MVPs are the best, so I guess I'm no different in that regard. Our Architect MVPs are an amazing group and I am already looking forward to the next opportunity to get a bunch of them in a room together again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He took a look at available systems and <a href="http://davidjwhite.net/myblog/archive/2005/09/28/40.aspx">came away</a> with the following opinions:</p><blockquote><p>The problem with all these [existing systems] is three fold as far as I am concerned: 1) they are way too expensive, 2) they are not extendable (meaning I can't program on them), and 3) they are not connected to the car. Imagine the last two put together!</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>So what exactly is my thought? I mean there are people shoving Mac Minis and mini-ITX form factors in cars now right? Yes they are, but to me it is wrong tool for the job and just not that interesting (I would love to hear if you think I am wrong). I think there are problems with power consumption and conversion, instant on and off scenarios, dash placement, etc. So I thought to go out and build my own system. I mean build my own system -from the ground up board and all. Add a flip out screen with a wiring harness into the car bus network and away I go. I plan on using Windows mobile 5.0 and the .Net Compact Framework for the UI of applications and part way down the stack until the real time requirements outstrip what a garbage collected environment can do. </p></blockquote><p>I've always had a hankering for learning embedded development, so I'll be following David's blog with great interest. I also love the title of his blog - Architect Must Implement. </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think the problem is beyond the obvious disconnect between software and hardware. We first have to get to the notion of a 'fly by wire' automobile paradigm. I have been looking at the options for a fully digital car, and the issue is 'standardization' of interface. By that I mean that I should be able to bring my dashboard to any car, and plug in my smart card and it will light up as if I was in my own car. Gas right where I like it with warnings at 2.3L to reserve etc.

But to accomplish that, we need to start making cars truly modular. Some of the 'skate board' prototypes for fuel cell cars are in that mode. A set of chassis with all the mechanics inside, looking very much like a skateboard. A shell with passenger compartment is dropped on top, and that is where all the customization takes place. Once the car is 'by wire' then our OOP model starts to work. Until then, we are still in the custom tool shop mode.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree but the problem is an old one. The automakers only want standardization in the components they buy but not their products. There are some emerging standards used in the intercommunication of components called CAN-BUS. This will atleast simplify the communications some but the industry has seen that before in J1930 where different automakers made thier own implementation of it.

Starts to sound familiar doesn't it. In fact since I deal with the automotive industry from a software level, my favorite conversation about standards, portability, and cross platform discussions start with a simple statement. So those tires on those car thingies, they are all the same right so I can take the wheels off my GM and put it on my Ford? The simple fact is every single one of them have slightly different bolt patterns. Go figure :-)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/markhsch/default.aspx">Mark Schmidt</a> from the WWF team built a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/markhsch/archive/2005/09/27/474633.aspx">nifty little app</a> to import the NHL hockey schedule into Outlook. So I went to import the Caps schedule, only to find that the time zones don't match up. All the game times are in east coast time and I am on the west coast. I was going to bug Mark for the code, but decided instead to change my current timezone to east coast, import the games into Outlook, and then change my timezone back. It's a bit of a hack, but it was quicker than changing the code. Sometimes, simple is better.</p><p>Now, I just need <a href="http://www.comcast.com/">Comcast</a> to get <a href="http://www.hd.net/nhlinhd.html">HDNet</a>.</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: No word from Concast on getting HDNet. They hope to have more HD Channels "by the end of the year". I found a <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/comcast1/petition.html">petition online</a> asking for HDNet on Comcast and a <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000873024786/">blog entry</a> from Mark Cuban (co-owner of HDNet) that compares HDNet vs. InHD to "David vs. Goliath". InHD is owned in part, I think, by Comcast. However, Comcast now owns the broadcast rights to the NHL via their <a href="http://www.olntv.com/nw/article/view/1268/?tf=nwNHLArticle.tpl">OLN network</a>. So I'm hoping we'll eventually see HD NHL on Comcast, thought it sounds like I have to wait a few months. :(</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the foreword to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=journal.3">Architecture Journal 3</a>, I wrote the following:</p><blockquote><p>Abstraction is the architect's key tool for dealing with complexity. We've seen the evolution of architectural abstractions techniques such as models and patterns; however, we have yet to realize much in the way of measurable value from them. Models and patterns are useful for communicating effectively with our peers, but so far they haven't helped drastically reduce the amount of resources it takes to build and operate a system. In order to continue to deal with increasing complexity, we need to get much more pragmatic about using abstraction to solve problems.</p></blockquote><p>Because the lack of measurable value to date, the IT industry at large has come to view models at best as "pretty pictures" and at worst as a pointless waste of time and resources. But the reality is, we use models in the IT industry all the time. I don't know what you're favorite modeling tool it, but my current favorite is C#. Before that was VB and before that was C++. I realize some of my readers might be more partial to Java, Ruby, or even Assembly. But the reality is: all of these so-called "higher level" programming languages are simply models of the CPU execution environment. </p><p>The only code that the CPU can understand is machine code. But nobody wants to write and debug all their code using 0’s and 1’s. So we move up a level of abstraction and use a language that humans can read more easily and that can be automatically translated (i.e. compiled) into machine code the CPU can execute. The simplest step above machine code is assembly language. But ASM isn't particularly productive so work with, so the industry has continuously raised the level of abstraction in the languages they use. C is a higher level of abstraction than ASM, adding concepts like types and functions. C++ is a higher level of abstraction than C, adding concepts like classes and inheritance. Each of these levels of abstraction presents a new model of the execution environment with new features that make programming more productive (and sometimes <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/09/08/Portability+Without+Productivity.aspx">more portable</a>). Different languages offer different models of the execution environment. For example, the Ruby model of the execution environment allows for the manipulation of class instances while the C++ model allows for multiple inheritance. This isn't to say one is better than the other - they are just different. </p><p>In the past decade, we've seen the rise in popularity of VM based programming environments - primarily Java and CLR. In these environments, there are multiple models at work. CLR languages and Java are models above the underling VM execution environment. The VM execution environment is, in turn, a model of the physical execution environment. As an example, a C#/Java program is translated into IL/bytecode at compile time and then from IL/bytecode to machine code at runtime. So in these VMs, two model translations have to occur in order to go from programming language to machine code. It turns out that this multiple step translation approach is also useful in non-VM environments. For example, the original C++ compiler output vanilla C code which was, in turn, compiled with a vanilla C compiler. C# and Java use a similar approach, except that the second translation occurs at runtime, not compile time.</p><p>So if Code is Model, what can we learn from looking at the success of mainstream text-based programming languages to help us in the development of higher abstraction modeling languages that are actually useful. This isn't an exhaustive list, but here are a few things (tenets?) I've thought of:</p><ul><li><u><b>Models must be Precise</b></u><br />There must be no ambiguity in the meaning of the elements in a model. In C#, every statement and keyword has an exact well-defined meaning. There is never a question as to what any given piece of C# code means. There may be context-sensitive meanings, such as how the keyword "using" has different meanings in C# depending on where it is used. If you don't have a similar level of precision in your model, there's no way to transform it to lower abstraction models in a deterministic fashion. Models that can't be transformed into lower abstraction models are nothing more than pretty pictures - perhaps useful for communication with other people on the project, but useless as development artifacts. 
</li><li><u><b>Model Transformation must be Deterministic</b></u><br />By definition (or at least by convention), models are at a higher level of abstraction than both your execution domain and mainstream programming languages - perhaps significantly higher. In order to derive value from a model, you must be able to transform it into the execution domain. Like the C# to IL to machine code example, the model transformation may comprise multiple steps. But each transformation between models must be as precise as the models themselves. When you compile a given piece of C# code, you get the same IL output every time. However, this transformation can vary across target models. For example, when you run a managed app on a x86 machine you get different machine code than if you ran it on an x64 machine. 
</li><li><u><b>Models must be Intrinsic to the Development Process<br /></b></u>Even if you have precise models and deterministic transformations, you have to make them first class citizens of the development process or they will become outdated quickly. How often have you blueprinted your classes with UML at the start of the project, only to have that class diagram be horribly out of date by the end of the project? In order to keep models up to date, they must be used through-out the development process. If you need to make a change, make the change to the model and then retransform into the execution domain. Think of C# and IL - do we use C# as a blueprint, transform once to IL and then hand edit the IL? No! We change the C# directly and retransform into IL. We need to have the same process even as we move into higher levels of abstraction. 
</li><li><u><b>Models Aren't Always Graphical<br /></b></u>Some things are best visualized as pictures, some things aren't. To date, we're much better at graphically modeling static structure than dynamic behavior. That's changing - for example, check out the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/sdk/htm/ebiz_prog_useod.gif">BTS</a> or <a href="http://www.windowsworkflow.net/images/Temp/WWF%20Designer%20Screenshot%20-%20thumbnail2.jpg">WF</a> tools. But generally, it's easier to model structure than behavior graphically. Don't try and put a square peg in a round hole. If a text based language is the best choice, that's fine. Think about the Windows Forms Designer in VS - you use a graphical "language" to lay out your user interface, but you implement event handlers using a text-based language. 
</li><li><u><b>Explicitly Call Out Models vs. Views <br /></b></u>One of the areas that I get easily confused about is model views. If I'm looking at two different model visualizations (text or graphical), when are they different models and when are they views into the same model. People don't seem to care much one way or the other, but I think the difference is critical. For example, a UML class model and a C# class are two separate models - you need a transformation to go back and forth between them. However, the VS <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/classdesigner/">Class Designer</a> is a graphical view into the model described by the C# class definitions. Changes in one view are immediately visible in the other - no transformation required. If you look at the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/classdesigner/archive/2005/07/29/444501.aspx">Class Designer file format</a>, you'll notice only diagram rendering specific information is stored (ShowAsAssociation, Position, Collapsed, etc.). I guess this could fall under "Models must be Precise" - i.e. you should precisely define if a given visualization is a view or a model - but I think this area is muddy enough to warrant it's own tenet.</li></ul><p>I'm sure there are more thoughts for this list, but that's a good start. Please feel free to leave your opinion on these tenets and suggestions for new ones in <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,7d6d6cb2-2300-4e39-8ad8-a2910d81d498.aspx">my comments</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[[Hmm, trying to submit a comment returned me to the same page with my comment text, let's try again...]

Great piece of writing, Harry! Here are some additions (also added in my blog, link above):

Models Aren't Always Graphical:
The only alternative to graphical models that you mention is text. I'd like to add matrices and tables. A matrix is normally like in IBM's Business Systems Planning, with objects on the axes and relationships marked in the cell at the intersection of their object. A table is basically an ordered list of objects and their properties: graphical models are otherwise poor at representing an ordered list. It's probably also useful to distinguish "standard" bubble-and-line graphical models from things like Sequence Diagrams, Constraint Diagrams, Spider Diagrams and even UI layouts, where the exact position of elements, and their position relative to each other, has semantic content.

To return to text: Unfortunately, text doesn't integrate well with other models, primarily because it has no notion of object identity. If I write a piece of code to go with a model, I often want to use the name of one of the model's objects in the code, but there is currently no good way to do this. Copying and pasting loses the link, i.e. if I update the name in the model, it will (at least in a half-way decent modeling tool) update everywhere else in the model where that name is visible, but the text will still contain the old value. 

Clearly, we need Smart Text, but exactly what that is and how it would work is an interesting research topic. Current text-based tools at best try to parse the text and cobble the links back together after changes, but that's time consuming, error prone, and basically bolting the stable door well after the horse has left. 

I guess Intentional Programming is aiming to be something like Smart Text. My impression so far though is that the Intentional Programming crowd aren't particularly amenable to graphical representations - "nah, we don't want those, we can do it all in text". Hopefully I'm wrong or that is going to change: model-driven development and Smart Text would complement each other perfectly.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good points Harry. I'm not a great fan of tenets though… ;-)

I whole-heartily agree that an important lesson not to forget from the 'CASE-years' is that (a) we can't lose fidelity between the execution side (code) and the design representations in any modeling approach and (b) no oceans will require boiling. It is interesting though that saying exactly what is 'code' is actually getting increasingly harder to do. 

To carry on your thread, it seems to me we are heading for more and more declarative style systems definitions either at the system framework level (Workflow State persistence, XAML presentation, Policy assertions) or at the DSL's for specific configuration points of a custom framework. The languages of C# and the like will always play the majority part, but it's the libraries/run-times and the like will really need the 'abstraction points' more. Perhaps it's the interface definitions (schema?) and the behaviors around those that need the most thought in terms of their expression in the model?

Another thought is that what we lack is the common conventions for visualization of these 'non-imperative' styles. To be a useful abstraction it would seem to be important to be able to relate and summarize these things concisely. Text is useful (and can be very precise) but polymetric visualizations (the sort of stuff that Edward Tufte has been on about for years) seems to be a harvestful area for models. In the last 20 years we've spent a lot of time working out that a class shouldn't look like a cloud but a rectangle, for example. We did that so we could scale model bits to used from *AsASketch to *AsABluePrint. As computer system designers we obviously dont have a lot of faith in computer system tools as a reliable enabler?

If we could let go of the UML mindset of a paper-printable-centric model representation that treats the run-time as a generic block then we could be making good progress for MDD. It's a note of irony of course that the MDA/MOF may be the exact opposite of what it will take to get to a next step of handling increased complexity. Maybe we should be letting go of those representations to move forward?

We do seem to be hitting a wall with the level of complexity we have at the moment and that a 'Unified' approach ain't gonna cut it. IMO.

PS Good 'model' refresher paper here for those interested:

"Models are Precise" - well:

(a) There is a use for imprecise models. When I'm sketching an architecture on the corner of a whiteboard, I don't need a precise semantics: I need a notation familiar enough that I can convey and discuss my ideas. What's familiar might depend on the business context and the level of implementation detail I'm talking at - flight paths, tube map, org charts, or maybe sequence charts.

(b) Where we do use models for precise purposes - generating code or configurations or whatever - it is useful if the precise notation is related to, and can easily degenerate into, the familiar imprecise form. So that I can quickly sketch an impression of what I want, and later fix up the detail to make it work.

Models are Abstract - no, this wasn't one of your headers, but I think it nearly was! Abstract means leaving stuff out; the power of it is that it lets me squeeze big ideas into my small brain. There's less information in an abstraction.  For me, this is the essential thing that makes it a "model": it leaves out information.

There are several distinct ways a model can be abstract - i.e. leave out information:

 1. Leave out unvarying assumptions. 
   1a   C is an abstraction of ASM because it's assumed your code follows some conventions -- for example, keeping stuff on the stack while calling a subroutine. By restricting ourselves to those assumptions, we can read the code more easily; the information is put back by the compiler.  Of course, a great benefit is that we can 'put back' different variants of the left-out stuff, to work atop different platforms.

   1b   A DSL that drives a framework - for example to configure a mobile phone or a watch - is abstract because it doesn't include the stuff that's the same every time: the basic structure of the phones.  In the DSL, we omit the information about those assumptions, and the generators and execution framework put it information back.

 2. Separation of concerns.
    A model that's about the sequence of pages in a GUI can leave out stuff about the appearance of the pages. The appearance can be dealt with in a separate language elsewhere. Here, the separate models leave out the information dealt with elsewhere, and the left-out information is put back when the different aspects or viewpoints are composed (by whatever mechanism).

(I suppose that really (1) is a particular case of (2) -- the place where you choose what platform you want to implement on is a separate language, and the choice of compiler is the composition mechanism.)

 3. Indeterminacy.
    The model is abstract because some of the information hasn't been determined or decided yet; or is maybe different every time. So for example:
   - an HTML page specifies a sequence of words, but it rarely defines exactly how they're arranged on a screen -- that depends on the width of the window etc.
   - programs in C# specify a sequence of behavior, but don't specify the exact timings of events; by contrast, MIDI defines the exact timings of the musical notes.
   - a test script defines a result (like "out*out==in", or "X less than 12") without saying how you might achieve it, nor even exactly what the result must be -- just some conditions it must fulfill.  
   - a specification - whether it's formal or informal, a slide show or a test script, or a set of example instances, or just a list of bullet points - is a model. If written well (!) it allows you to discuss the system or solution, without including all the fine detail.

To me, the indeterminate kind of abstraction is a very important kind of model in software engineering. It allows you to talk sensibly about things without having decided everything yet.  This is an essential, because you can't decide everything all at once.  

Programming languages aren't terribly good at this - they tend only to make sense once all the decisions have been made.  While we're half-way through a design, I want something that helps me think and talk about half-formed stuff. When working more towards the code, I want things like sequence diagrams etc; when more at the business end, I want languages appropriate to the kind of business domain; and the more I work in a particular domain, the more I want languages attuned to that domain. But again: if it's only good at expressing finished ideas, it's a kind of programming language; for me, a real *modeling* language is one that helps me while I'm developing the ideas.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Alan - I almost agree.

I think imprecise *Sketch Models are 'ok', and are in many ways, they are where we are now, i.e. UML2. I just wanted to add a thought though.

But [and at this point I think it's fair to claim a coup d'etat on Harry's blog, just by sheer weight of text] I also think Sketching ability inhibits us slightly from keeping the models nice and tight to the execution-side. One of my greatest fears (goodness, that sounds over-dramatic) is in that progress in Modeling will be held back by going through a number of new rounds of gathering consensus around over a common display notation. If we can't degenerate for pen&board the Model notation then so be it - the steam train rolls on, but if we can, then great; just don't want to sacrifice anything for it. 

I think that the benefits of a sketched/shared notation are actually only a small part of the battle in making sure that two people are sharing the same context when designing something. It's often all 'about the run-time' and how well you both share knowledge of it. The sketched rectangles help like they helped pattern languages, you can still talk at cross purposes for as long as you can keep reality at bay. RE:What most people think a Singleton or even MVC patterns do.

Also, as soon as the model becomes an purely optional part of the development cycle is where it runs the risk of being irrelevant and seen as a withering design artifact for 'that guy in an office down the hall'. 

Put another way, I'd trade some common Sketch notation ability any day of the week, as long as it meant I could always get to an execution 'vehicle' and could model early in terms of validating my ideas with the framework's help, i.e. rather than the whiteboard's. I want to 'run' my model as a part of an iterative design process?
With the frameworks getting so complex now then the gap between being able to try your ideas from some sort of limited notation into actually running them is getting smaller. We seem to be growing 'rails' all the time, let's make use of that. 

Anyhoo, I would be tempted to rename 'Models must be Precise' with something like 'Models must be in Context' or 'Models make Assumptions' or even 'Models Miss Things Out We Already Know Because Our Brains Are Too Small'. I like the last one best.

I did like your comments on abstraction very much, but for me personally I sway towards a modeling language that helps me validate my ideas early rather than share them early.

Hi Harry,

While I tend to agree that there is a place for precise formal models that can be transformed easily to lower levels. 
I would also like to argue that 
	○ I think that imprecise models are also very useful, since at different points in time during the development you cannot fully specify all the finest details (even if for the "current" level of abstraction) esp. since most projects these days are iterative.
	○ Which brings me to the next point - for imprecise models - I don't necessarily think that there's a need to keep (all of) them updated during the development life-cycle. The high-level designs can be replaces by detailed designs and they in turn can be replaces with the code itself - good code explains itself beautifully :) . 
	○ You should carefully weight the ROI for creating such a precise model. For example I happened to work on a large (hundreds of man-year) project where the initial thought was to use a tool (Vitech's Core (http://www.vtcorp.com/overview.html) ) to for requirements analysis. The benefit was that (if done right) the model created can be "run" using their built-in simulator. After spending more than half a year (of a rather large team) we finally decided to drop this precise model for a much less precise model of use-cases which allow for a varying level of abstraction. It should be noted though, that (cross-subsystems) use cases are later refined into a DSL  which is actively used for generating cross-subsystem interfaces and simulate  missing system during  integrations. 
	○ Another point from the former example is on the timing of requiring the precision. Modeling tools should allow several levels of precision, since in earlier stages you (usually) cannot determine all the bits and bytes that will allow for a "deterministic transformation" 
	 
	
Just my 2 cents

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great post, Harry!

We often use the term "higher level of abstraction" as the one and only right answer to manage complexity. A better description would be to use the "appropriate level of abstraction" for the task at hand and I blogged on it here http://blog.intentionalsoftware.com/intentional_software/2005/09/appropriate_lev.html

In that blog we also discussed the need for multiple levels of abstractions that are editable. So the issue of bi-directional transformations between models comes up. Mentally, we think of it as a refinement between the appropriate level. The trick is to maintain model level consistency as editing progresses. In the real messy world, where code is stored in simple text files, that can be edited at will, this is a tricky and expensive problem. Integrating the code in a smarter way might make it a lot easier.

As for Steven Kelly's earlier blog comment about Intentional only doing SmartText based stuff: Your hopes are correct, we think a combination of text and graphics is the most powerful, and also the most natuaral to use.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have to admit I was ready to debunk this until you got into the (somewhat philosophical) discussion of code being an abstraction layer between the CPU and the developer - nice touch!  That said, I think we can agree that there are different types of models for different types of purposes.  Developers will easily buy into Code is Model but business analysts (and to a lesser extent, architects) will not.  The concept of domain-specfic models helps address this issue.   The one (minor) quibble is the section at the end dealing with views.  Just as we can have different types of models we can also have differnet types views of a single model.  We might have a code view versus a graphical view or an individual participant's view of a larger business process (e.g. a raw material supplier's view of their role and responsibilities in a larger manufacturer's supply chain).

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've been waiting to come up with something profound to toss in here, and I will give that up to point out one particular thing.  First, I agree about (machine) code.  You can tell that from "What Computers Know" (http://nfocentrale.net/orcmid/blog/2006/02/what-computers-know.asp).

But I'm not sure that we are raising the level of abstraction exactly (though raising something, for sure) as we move up through layers of programming languages, maybe not even domain-specific languages.  

Why do I say that?

Well, because the model is not married to the behavior that is elicited from the computer.  We are doing something about the expressibility of certain things, but we need to understand that a good part of that expressibility having to do with what the program is for is an illusion that only we know and understand.  It has no impact on what the computer does.

My simple illustration has to do with obfuscation of code.  Run your source-code-as-model through a really-great obfuscator.  Same behavior by the computer; clearly a fully-equivalent program is produced.  But where's the model now?

In some sense, the transformation from source to executable preserves something and it also delivers something.  The delivery is (at best) very loosely-related to our intention for the software.  It seems to me that the programs we write preserve our model while being indifferent to it.  That this works at all is a consequence of our care and only our care.

That says to me that the articulation of the model will likely always have to be elsewhere.  Source code doesn't really carry it except as a kind of computer-ignored narrative and cues (choice of identifiers) that are for us and not the machine.  Furthermore, our model is generally different than one that deals at the level of abstraction which has the computer's behavior as its "extensional" meaning.

[I don't want to rule out the value of model-driven schemes at this point, although I think it is important to understand where the design rules come from and how that is not anything the computer "knows" on its own.]

Hmm, maybe this is baked enough to start writing about ... .

Really bad for the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=251005011">Penguins</a>, but I hate the Penguins so that's cool. And I was pleasantly surprised to discover that OLN was broadcasting the Rangers/Flyers game in HD on INHD. They have an <a href="http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/1377/?tf=NHLArticleWrapper.tpl">HDTV broadcast schedule</a>, so the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/10/04/The+NHL+In+Outlook+.aspx">need for HDNet</a> just dropped dramatically. I will have to spring for <a href="http://www.indemand.com/sports/nhl2005/index.jsp">NHL Center Ice</a> - one night of the free preview and I'm sold. The only bummer was not getting the Caps game live - with all 30 teams in action tonight, there weren't enough channels to carry them all live. But they won, and after eighteen months and one day since their last game that is good enough for me. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From newly converted ARC MVP <a href="http://samgentile.com/blog">Sam Gentile</a>, I found <a href="http://blog.hackedbrain.com/archive/2005/10/06/3193.aspx">this interesting post</a> from <a href="http://blog.hackedbrain.com/">Drew Marsh</a> about how XAML is compiled:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>XAML is indeed a language, but it is never compiled into C# or IL... The truth is, it's not "compiled" at all. If anything you can say it is "compacted" and that only happens in scenarios where it is turned into a BAML stream. That, however, is an optimization and not a necessity for XAML to work. XAML can be interpreted purely in it's raw XML text form, using <a href="http://winfx.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/O_T_System_Windows_Serialization_Parser_LoadXml.asp"><font color="#146c9a">Parser::LoadXml</font></a>. Even BAML is interpreted, it's just a far more compact and efficient representation of the object graph than raw XML text.<br />[Drew Marsh - <a class="singleposttitle" id="viewpost.ascx_TitleUrl" href="http://blog.hackedbrain.com/archive/2005/10/06/3193.aspx"><font color="#146c9a">The XAML Experience</font></a>]</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Given that I just <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/10/05/Code+Is+Model.aspx">wrote about compiling</a>, I wanted to weigh with a couple of points:</p><ul dir="ltr"><li><div>First, by definition compilation is a translation from one format to another. Therefore, converting XAML to BAML is a compilation step. The <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/sdm/default.aspx">SDM folks</a> have a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms151031">command line tool</a> for compiling deployment reports from the models in the <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/teamcenters/architect/">Architect edition of VSTS</a>. However, I assume what Drew meant here was that XAML isn't compiled into a directly executable format, so in reality I'm just being picky about the use of the word "compiled". </div></li><li><div>Second, the fact that the XAML is compiled into an efficient binary representation and then embedded as a resource (<a href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/rrelyea/archive/2004/01/31/2306.aspx">as per Rob Relyea</a>) is fascinating from an implementation perspective, but somewhat irrelevant semantically. Drew points out that the BAML is interpreted. With VM environments like CLR, the line between interpreted and compiled blurs considerably. <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/09/30/15100.aspx">Rob's post</a> referenced above is based on the PDC 03 XAML bits, and at the time, XAML could be compiled into BAML <i>or </i>IL. However, at the time (20 months ago) Rob guessed that the IL compilation would be cut because the BAML perf was just as good or better, the file size was smaller and localization is easier. In the end, the XAML file is converted into a format the machine can execute - the specific choice of compilers and transformations isn't particularly interesting from a modeling perspective since it happens automatically.</div></li></ul><p>XAML isn't the only place where the traditional compiling to executable model is being stretched. In <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/workflow/default.aspx">Windows Workflow Foundation</a>, though your workflow is defined as a type, you can actually <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/markhsch/archive/2005/09/23/473373.aspx">modify running instances</a> of the workflow. Given that WF supports declaring workflows as C# or XOML (soon to be XAML), I wonder if they are going to go the same route as WPF and eliminate the C#/IL way of declaring workflows. Another interesting example is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/default.aspx">LINQ</a> and C# 3.0. This is interesting because you can use LINQ directly on in memory data, but when you apply it to database (via <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/c/f/b/cfbbc093-f3b3-4fdb-a170-604db2e29e99/DLinq%20Overview.doc">DLinq</a>) the LINQ statements are parsed into expression trees then converted into SQL. (Check out <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2005/09/30/expressiontrees">this post</a> from <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog">Ian Griffiths</a> for deeper coverage of expression trees).</p><p>Anyway, it's late and I realize I've written quite a bit to basically say that the definition of "compiled" is pretty blurry at this point and getting blurrier going forward. In the end, it's much more interesting IMO to focus on the model environment you're working in (XAML in this case) rather than the details of how that model is translated into the execution environment, unless you're the one building those translation tools.</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong> - I had one other thought on all this. It's interesting that computing power (CPU + IO bandwidth) have improved to a point where the performance of interpreting BAML at runtime is as fast than executing XAML compiled to IL directly. I certainly wouldn't have assumed that. </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A) IL still works
You said:
I wonder if they are going to go the same route as WPF and eliminate the C#/IL way of declaring workflows
RR: WPF still supports using code only (you don't need to ever use XAML if you don't want to...most tools will be built using XAML as the persistance model though).  We just don't convert XAML into all IL anymore.  I believe WWF/XAML will be similar, but I'm not positive.

B) CPU + IO Bandwidth
The BAML vs IL question you raise in your UPDATE is an interesting one.

When we used to compile XAML to IL, the EXEs were much larger.  IL can't be processed as it is downloaded.  With BAML, you have a shared amount of code to load it, and repeated baml records to load and discard.

So there are a bunch of factors here.  Download size of the assembly, streamability of the baml, etc...

We were surprised that IL wasn't much faster than BAML.  Happily, that allowed us to focus all of our developement, optimizations, testing on one code path, which is a good thing.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Which Abstractions Matter?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">I've been following the ongoing discussion about typing systems in programming languages between <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a> and <a href="http://relevancellc.com/blogs/index.php">Stu Halloway</a> with great interest. Given that I believe <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/10/05/Code+Is+Model.aspx">Code is Model</a>, I'm eager to mine knowledge from successful tools to apply at higher levels of abstraction. And as an employee of a language vendor, I'm also very interested in what Stu describes as vendor-oriented vs. developer-oriented languages.</p><blockquote><p align="left">So why has the static/dynamic debate staggered on for so long? I think we could get closer to some answers with better choice of terms. “Static” vs. “dynamic” is highly misleading. I propose we use a new set of names: vendor-oriented vs. developer-oriented programming...So who do you trust most: vendors or developers?<br />[<a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs/?p=65">What’s new in C#, or who do you trust most?</a>]</p><p align="left">With a vendor-oriented language like C#, core abstractions are much more firmly controlled by the language vendor. Conversely, developer-oriented languages like Python leave more of these choices to the developer (although they tend to provide reasonable defaults)...Competency and trustworthiness are sprinkled all over our industry, both among language vendors and application developers. My concern is who controls the abstractions. Developer-oriented languages (like Scheme) give a lot of control (and responsibility) to developers. Vendor-oriented languages (like Java) leave that control more firmly in the hands of the vendor.<br />[<a title="Permanent Link to Developer oriented languages" href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs/?p=69" rel="bookmark">Developer oriented languages</a>]</p></blockquote><p align="left">Personally, I think calling them static and dynamic language is far less misleading than vendor and developer oriented languages. Further, I think Stu is making somewhat absurd statements to garner attention. However, I believe he's certainly onto something with regard to the language abstractions. The abstractions I and my team care about on our project are almost assuredly going to be different from the abstractions you and your team care about on your project. Having a programming environment that enables the abstractions you need on a given project is very very important. </p><p align="left">The problem with Stu's argument is that he's focused on low level language abstractions. Abstractions like "inheritance, encapsulation, delegation, how symbols are interpreted, etc." Are you kidding me? Projects don't fail because developers can't change the language's concept of inheritance. They fail because the gap between the abstractions provided by the language and the abstractions needed by the solution are enormous. Modern software development is like building skyscrapers with Lego blocks. Furthermore, projects fail because business and IT don't speak the same language. Business people don't care about concepts like encapsulation and symbol interpretation. They care about concepts like ROI, business plans and regulatory compliance. Geeks may not feel comfortable talking about those concepts, but they are what keep a business in business </p><p align="left">Imagine your CFO listening to Stu and Ted discuss these language abstractions. They would be thinking "What the hell are they talking about?" To Ted's credit, he bluntly states that he <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/PermaLink,guid,eb41bdd9-decc-44ba-916c-9346a959fff6.aspx">doesn't trust developers</a> which would likely put him in well with the CFO:</p><blockquote><p align="left">I see the same concern every time a developer starts talking about doing bytecode manipulation at load-time--just because you <em>can</em> doesn't mean you <em>should</em>. In this respect, I trust the guys who've been down this road before much more so than developers who are just coming to this and are starting to flex their new-found freedom and will (undoubtedly) start building systems that exercise this power. <br />[<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/PermaLink,guid,eb41bdd9-decc-44ba-916c-9346a959fff6.aspx">Dynamic languages, type systems and self-modifying systems</a>]</p></blockquote><p align="left">I wouldn't go so far as to say I don't trust developers, but Ted's point about <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> is spot on. I'm sure there are scenarios where bytecode manipulation is critical to the success of the project. Hell, in the project I'm currently heads down on (hence the lack o' posts in the past two weeks) I'm using much more reflection and late-binding than I ever have before. Not because I can - frankly, I like static typing - but because that's the best way to solve the problem at hand. </p><p align="left">It's important to keep the big picture in mind when discussing minutia such as a given programming language's core abstractions. IT exists to serve the business, not the other way around.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">I've gotten some great feedback on my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/10/05/Code+Is+Model.aspx">Code is Model</a> post. But before I get to those comments, I wanted to talk a little bit about the role of tools. Tools are important in every industry, but in no industry are they as important or central as they are to information technology.</p><p align="left">One of the fascinating differences between IT architecture and "real world" architecture is the feasibly of automated transformation. If I have a blueprint of a house, there is no tool to automatically transform it into a house - someone has to do the actual work of putting up the walls, running the plumbing, etc. But in IT architecture, I can transform blueprints - i.e. the code - into the finished application automatically. That speaks volumes about the importance of tools in information technology.</p><p align="left">Without the tools to automate the transformation, all IT models - code or otherwise - are nothing more than documentation. </p><p align="left">So if we are to include models as part of our development process, we need tools to execute the transformations between levels of abstraction. But where do those tools come from? In the case of abstractions with widespread horizontal appeal, they are likely to come from language vendors such as Microsoft. For example, abstractions like <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/512aeb7t">generics</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq">query expressions</a> are useful in almost nearly every project, so it makes sense to include them in mainstream languages like C#. However, one of the key points of <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/sf">Software Factories</a> is that in order to continue raising the level of abstraction, we are going to need narrow the domain to which those abstractions apply.</p><blockquote><p align="left">Developing language-based tools is currently quite expensive, and therefore makes economic sense only in broad horizontal domains, such as user interface construction and data access, where the necessary investments can be amortized over a large customer base. For this reason, commercial implementations of the <a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/droberts/evolve.html">Language Framework pattern</a> are supplied almost exclusively by platform vendors.</p><p align="left">This economic model is threatened by the trade off between scope and value for abstractions. As <a href="http://www.aw-bc.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,020159627X,00.html">Jackson puts it</a>, the value of an abstraction increases with its specificity to the problem domain. The higher the level of an abstraction, the narrower the domain to which it applies, but the more value it provides in solving problems in that domain.</p><p align="left">We are now at a point in the evolution of the software industry where frameworks and tools must become more vertically focused, in order to realize further productivity gains. They must provide more value for smaller classes of problems. This breaks the current economic model because markets for vertically focused frameworks and tools are too small to support platform plays, and because the domain knowledge required to develop them is housed mainly in end user organizations that have not traditionally been software suppliers.<br />[<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/softwarefactwo.asp">Problems and Innovations</a> by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jackgr">Jack Greenfield</a>]</p></blockquote><p align="left">In other words, these domain focused languages, frameworks and tools are <i>not</i> going to come from traditional language vendors like Microsoft. They are going to come from organizations that have deep experience in the given domain, many of whom will not be traditional software vendors. I think SIs and ISVs will adopt this approach before many end user organizations do, but eventually any organization that invests in building reusable frameworks is going to want to invest in building languages and tools to automate the usage of those frameworks.</p><p align="left">I think the best way to start developing these tools is to incorporate their construction directly into the software development lifecycle. I liken this to Test Driven Development. If you use a TDD approach, at the end of your project you end up with two outputs - the project and the unit tests. Assuming the code you're building now (with their associated unit tests) is designed to meet current requirements, you shouldn't need to refactor it significantly until those requirements change sometime in the future. The tests you build today become a tool to help you improve your code in the future when the requirements change. From a tool development perspective, Test Driven Development is a specific instance of the more generic concept of Tool Driven Development, as tests are a specific type of tool. </p><p align="left">What if, instead of building code test first, you thought about building tools first?</p><p align="left">The problem with tests is that hey are tightly bound to the current project. They may help you improve this project's code in the future, but they won't help you develop other applications. I think we should also focus on building tools that make it easier to build the existing project. The goal would be to be able to use these tools not only on future iterations of the current project, but on other similar projects as well.  </p><p align="left">Of course, we don't really have the infrastructure to do this effectively today. We need to be able to make it easier to build tools, compose tools and evolve tools over time. Supporting evolution will be key since these tools will likely need to be refined as they are applied to different projects. Test Driven Development has xUnit style frameworks, Tool Driven Development needs the equivalent. The <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/dsltools/default.aspx">DSL Tools</a> and <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/gat/default.aspx">Guidance Automation Toolkit</a> are a good start, but aren't enough to enable Tool Driven Development on their own. </p><p align="left">Do you believe this Tool Driven approach can work? What do you think Tool Driven Development tools would look like? Please <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,52d0c3b9-65e3-43dd-af6d-54aca306e61f.aspx">let me know</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yes, I fully agree. One big part of that seems integration with source code control to me. Often tools that are part of the build process are installed via an installer onto machines. This approach really breaks down, once you have rapid evolution of the tools, in sync with your project dev. I think making rapid changes in these small tools is important, but I also think that they will NOT be terribly backwards compatible, unlike huge languages like C#. So, I expect that tool T1 in version 3.0 will not be able to work on the models defined for building version 2.8, rather there would probably be a process to transform the model accordingly in version 2.9 (I am not sure whether I am very clear with this... Just generally I believe that the solution will be more to make sure each version of a small tool can handle input data from the previous version, but not to make sure each tool will be able to handle ALL old file format).

So, either those tools should be stored as binaries within source code control, so that if I check out a branch for an old version and build it uses the old version of the tool. Or, probably even better, it should build the tool as one of the first stepts with each full build and then use that dll/exe later on in the same build process. Good automation there would be incredibly helpful.

Also, this is very important for the VS IDE DSL editors created with the DSL Tool. Really what should happen is that if I check out a specific branch of my source code, the corresponding version of my custom DSL editor tool is dynamically loaded into the IDE. The approach I see right now to have a seperate install for the DSL that works across all versions within my source code depot is really not very usable, since it would require to be incredibly backwards compatible with my tools, which I don't really think brings any value for very small tools that might not be used across too many programs (and probably only internally too).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Although I would like to see a DSL for my domain, I don't think that tool-driven development is a natural extension of test-driven development. 

In test-driven development, the goal is to define some functionality, define the tests, then build and test. Both the code and the unit tests are directly related to the specific release of a specific system. 

In tool-driven development, the goal is essentially to codify domain expertise in some form of DSL and/or a tool to execute the transformations from model to code. This tool delivery is only indirectly related to the delivery of a specific product and specific release, and often imposes a cost that is cannot be borne by the budget of a specific release. 

The tools are best left to a "functional" group of people who are responsible for developing, evolving, and sustaining the product or subsystem over multiple releases. They will build the domain expertise over time, and they are most likely to get extra money in their budget to develop a tool because it helps them meet their objectives of codifying domain expertise for current and future work.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things have been quiet around here lately because I've been heads down on a dev project. We (that is to say, I) reached code complete today, so look for more posts shortly. But I wanted to quickly post a few things on deploying application that use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/express">SQLServer Express</a>. It turns out that there are some significant differences between SSE and it's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql">older sibling</a> with respect to Xcopy deployment.</p><p>First off, go read <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165716(en-US,SQL.90).aspx">this article on Xcopy deployment</a> and <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143684(en-US,SQL.90).aspx">this article on User Instances</a>. And while you're out surfing, download <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fa87e828-173f-472e-a85c-27ed01cf6b02&amp;DisplayLang=en">SSEUtil</a> - it's a great little command line utility (i.e. no installer) that you can use to list, detach, attach, and create SSE databases.</p><p>Anyway, one of the MAJOR changes (and the one that gave my installer fits all day) is this idea of user or child instances of SSE. From the docs:</p><blockquote><p>The user instance, also known as a child or client instance, is an instance of SQL Server that is generated by the parent instance (the primary instance running as a service, such as SQLExpress) on behalf of a user. The user instance runs as a user process under the security context of that user. The user instance is isolated from the parent instance and any other user instances running on the machine. The user instance feature is also referred to as “Run As Normal User” (RANU).</p></blockquote><p>This is a big deal because essentially you have 2 instance of SSE running - the main one and the user specific one. And they're different. I was totally confused by this because I didn't realize it was happening. I created a new DB in .sqlexpress with VS but then it wouldn't show up when I listed the databases with SSEUtil. The reason is the SSEUtil defaults to the child instance while creating a new DB with VS defaults to the main instance.</p><p>This is particularly relevant if you want to use the AttachDBFilename feature. I'm using SSE as a cache, so I wanted to put it in the &lt;username&gt;Application Data folder. But I couldn't get the main instance of SSE to attach to a database in that folder tree. It drove me batty! I literally would move the DB from folder to folder - it works fine in My Docs, but not in App Data. However, it works fine from the child instance - I'm guessing that's on purpose.</p><p>So my installer puts the DB file in the &lt;username&gt;App Data folder (<a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/HowToDevelopCodeAsANonAdmin.html">as per Keith's book</a>) and changed my connection string to include the parameter "user instance=true". Also, if you're using AttachDBFilename, you need to include the initial catalog or database parameter, but without a value. In other words "Initial Catalog=". Weird. But it worked like a charm.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wasn't there, but apparently <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog.jspa?blog=317">Grady Booch</a> made a comment at <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2005">OOPSLA</a> last month that throwing away models is a good thing. <a href="http://www.metacase.com/blogs/jpt/blogView">Juha-Pekka's</a><a href="http://www.metacase.com/blogs/jpt/blogView?showComments=true&amp;entry=3308396982">account</a> of the <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2005/ShowEvent.do?id=304">Design and Modern Software Practices Panel</a> has Grady saying "when the project gets closer to the delivery you normally throw away UML models. This is a natural choice since the efforts needed for keeping the design - user view, dynamics, behavior, interaction etc. - linked with the implementation are simply too high." <a href="http://ivan.truemesh.com/">Ivan Moore</a><a href="http://ivan.truemesh.com/archives/000542.html">has Grady saying</a> "I often throw models away but tend not to throw away the source code." </p><p>I've gotta believe that this comment was somehow taken out of context and that the Grand Poobah of the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/12/10/Booch+On+DSLs+Round+3.aspx">Common Semantic Model</a> doesn't actually believe that tossing the model at the end o the project is a good thing. If we view these comments thru the lens of <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/10/05/Code+Is+Model.aspx">Code is Model</a>, you realize this is a major violation of the "Models must be Intrinsic to the Development Process" tenet. Since code is model, it seems silly to throw out the UML model and keep the code model. The only reason I could think to do that, is because the UML model has no value.</p><p>And this leaves me wondering, exactly how much benefit does Grady Booch get from his UML model if he's willing to throw them away near the end of the project.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, to me the UML diagrams are just a tool, a means to an end, but not the end itself. They are very nice to quickly visualize and start thinking about the relationships in the code and it's behavior, but there comes a moment at which code is just so much better at it that it might not be useful to keep synching them by hand. 

What I mean is that, at that point, the UML diagrams become useful as a visualization tool, and no longer as useful as a design tool (though by no means useless); and that's where model generation from code becomes far more interesting.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think what they are saying is that you should use the UML at first to design the system, but since UML tools do not do a good job of making it easy to keep code and UML models in synch you get to a point where the maintenance is no longer worth the benefit, and therefore they toss the UML models in the trash after that point is reached.  There would be no point in keeping them unless you intend to keep them up to date with the code, and since that becomes very burdensome after a while, it is more economical to throw them away.  This, of course, has nothing to do with wether or not UML models are useful, of course they are.  It has everything to do with the failure of the tools to provide an easy means of syncrhonizing code and models.  Makes sense to me.  If the tools vendors make the link then you will find the "throw them away" rule abandonned and people will then say, "Keep them".   That's my take.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If Code-Is-Model is really an accurate statement, then throwing away the non-code model (the UML) is a completely legitimate thing to do as soon as it loses its value or gets in the way of maintaining the model that matters (the code).

I think Grady's point here (I wasn't there) had to be something like this: Use a UML model (or whatever other high abstraction language you choose) when it has value and throw it away the moment it gets in your way or become an intolerable tax on your project.

This is why I've always felt that all "code-as-model" modeling tools should use the code as the serialization format for the model. This is what the old Together tool did and that is why people liked it so much. The UML was just a way to visualize your code. There was no such thing as round tripping because there was only one thing...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven’t had a chance to check out the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=journal.5">most recent issue</a> of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=journal.5">The Architecture Journal</a>, I highly recommend it. In particular, I liked <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/library.aspx?pid=journal.5&amp;id=msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/Jour5metro.asp">Metropolis and SOA Governance</a> by <a href="http://www.veryard.com/so/soapbox.htm">Richard Veryard</a> and Philip Boxer as well as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/library.aspx?pid=journal.5&amp;id=msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/Jour5Value.asp">Value Driven Architecture</a> by Charlie Alfred. </p><p>Richard and Philip dive deep on governance, leveraging Chris Alexander’s <a href="http://www.natureoforder.com/">Nature of Order</a> and Pat Helland’s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/library.aspx?pid=journal.2&amp;id=msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj2metrop.asp">Metropolis</a>. In particular, I liked the section on the structural implications of service orientation. As per Alexander, large complex systems can’t be designed in the traditional manner – they evolve over time. This leads Richard and Philip to discuss the highly fascinating concept of asymmetric demand. To quote the article: “Asymmetry means that the forms of demand are increasingly specific to the context in which they arise.” I can’t do the concept justice – just go read the article – but my takeaway is that what you sell isn’t necessarily what people are buying. Take <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql">SQL Server</a> for example – you know, one of those products that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/applicationplatform/launch2005">launched a new version yesterday</a>. Amazing product, but nobody buys SQL Server on its own. It’s always bought in the context of a larger solution. SQL is extremely flexible, so the number of contexts in which it’s appropriate is extremely high. But still, how many business people have ever said “We need to buy a database”. I’m guessing zero. Business people say things like “We need to keep better track of our shipments/inventory/customers/orders/etc” or “we need to better insight into business trends” or “we need to be able to demonstrate our compliance with &lt;insert government regulation here&gt;”. These business problems all need a database like SQL Server, but they need more than SQL Server alone. That’s the asymmetry. Microsoft sells SQL Server (among other things of course, but let’s focus for a second), but customers are buying a solution to their business problem. </p><p>On the topic of business problems, Charlie’s article on value modeling flat out states that traditional requirements based design is ineffective. Charlie’s agrees with Jack and Keith that requirements define a system, not the problem the system is intended to address. As such, often critical design decisions are made while defining requirements that have drastic impact on the development of the system down the road. As a somewhat silly example, if I define requirements for a software system, I am precluding any non-software system solution to the problem. What if the best solution for a problem isn’t software? Because of mistaken assumptions I’ve made in the requirements gathering process, I’ve eliminated the best solution to the problem. Woops.</p><p>And Charlie has this great quote about the requirements gathering process: </p><blockquote><p>Traditional approaches, like use case scenarios or business/marketing requirements, start by focusing on the types of actors with which the system interacts. This approach has several major limitations: </p><ul><li><p>It focuses more on what things the actors do, and less on why they do them. </p></li><li><p>It tends to stereotype actors into categories, where all individuals of a type are essentially the same (traders, portfolio managers, or system administrators, for example). </p></li><li><p>It tends to ignore differences in limiting factors (for example: Is an equity trader in New York the same as one in London? Is trading at market open the same as trading during the day?). </p></li><li><p>It is based on binary outcomes: the requirement is met or it isn't. The use case completes successfully or it doesn't. </p></li></ul><p>There is a very logical, practical reason why this approach is popular. It uses sequential and classification-based reasoning, so it is easy to teach and explain, and it can produce a set of objectives that are easy to verify. Of course, if simplicity were the only goal that counted, we'd all still be walking or riding horses to get from one place to another.</p></blockquote><p>I love the point about simplicity. Often, we do things in IT that are simple for IT but that are more complex (and thus bad) for the business. For example, a web app may be the easiest to deploy for IT, but if I have a mobile workforce that web application will cause more business headaches than it solves in IT.</p><p>In other Architecture Journal related news, you can sign up for a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/register/defaultc.mspx">free subscription</a>, so what are you waiting for?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, Amigo Grady Booch admits to <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/11/07/Grady+Booch+Sez+Throw+Models+Away.aspx">throwing away models</a>. Now, Amigo <a href="http://www.ivarjacobson.com">Ivar Jacobson</a> has signed on as a VSIP partner:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>Microsoft has tapped Ivar Jacobson, known as one of the fathers of the popular Rational Unified Process (RUP), to lead an effort to deliver a lightweight unified process to the Microsoft Solutions Framework. </p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>Jacobson said the first fruits of his company's relationship with Microsoft will be through the delivery of the Essential Unified Process (Essential UP), which is based on the Microsoft Solutions Framework and integrated with VSTS. 
</p><p>In short, Essential UP is a simplified or lighter-weight alternative to RUP, Jacobson said. Essential UP is an evolution of the unified process Jacobson helped create more than 10 years ago that forms the foundation of RUP, he said. </p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>"We need more lightweight processes," Jacobson said, noting that RUP has become too heavyweight and cumbersome. "We have competition from India, China and the former Soviet Union," he said. "It is not enough to be agile." 
</p><p>Indeed, Microsoft has done a good job with its Microsoft Solutions Framework, and "their process agility is a clear differentiator for them," Jacobson said. 
</p><p>"Essential UP stands on all the experience we have from RUP, but also offers us a chance to have a fresh start," Jacobson said. "We start in a new way because we've learned what works and what doesn't work."</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>"RUP has a lot of good stuff, but it needs a correction," [Jacobson] said.</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>However, among the primary problems Jacobson said he has with RUP is that it is "heavyweight." 
</p><p>Also, "the process architecture needs to be refactored," Jacobson said. "It is very difficult to add new practices because it will force a big change in the base. For instance, adding in a streamlined way practices such as EA [Enterprise Architect], SOA [service-oriented architecture], ABD [asset-based development], re-engineering legacy systems and commercial off-the-shelf software would be very difficult, if at all possible. So I believe in starting all over fresh but not throwing away anything that is good." </p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>"Having an industry luminary build the next version of his tool for our platform is huge for us," [VSTS General Manager Rick] LaPlante said. </p><p>[From <span class="Article_Title"><a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1886531,00.asp">Microsoft Taps Former Rational Heavyweight to Lend Credence to Enterprise Tools Play</a>, eWeek]</span></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">I'd like to nominate Rick's comment for understatement of the year awards. It also gets me wondering what Amigo Jim Rumbaugh is up to these days.</p><p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>I Hate The Term Mashup</title>
		<link>http://devhawk.net/2005/11/22/i-hate-the-term-mashup/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wikipedia has two definitions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup">mashup</a>:</p><ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)">Mashup (music)</a>: a musical genre consisting of the combination of the parts of more than one song 
</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)">Mashup (web application hybrid)</a>: a website or web application that combines content from more than one source</li></ul><p>I was originally introduced to the term mashup in the musical sense by <a href="http://www.dailysourcecode.com/">Daily Source Code</a>. In this usage, mashup implies mixing songs together. Given that songs are typically stand along entities designed to be enjoyed as is, mashup means (to me anyway) combining stuff <i>that was never meant to be combined in the first place</i>. Even Wikipedia includes musical mashup under the general heading of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BastardPop">Bastard Pop</a>.</p><p>So given that, by definition, mashups combine stuff that wasn't designed to be combined, I don't understand why an application like <a href="http://www.zvents.com/">Zvents</a> or <a href="http://apps.nikhilk.net/VirtualPlaces">Virtual Places</a> is considered a mashup. Apps like these use browser based components (<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scoble</a> calls them <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/11/07/what-do-you-call-things-like-flickr-microsoft-gadgets-google-maps-amazon-affiliate-parts/">Internet Connected Components</a>) that are well defined, have public APIs and are designed to be used together. Not exactly "bastard pop" now is it?</p><p>In reality, a site like Zvents could have used a server side mapping component and provided a similar experience. Of course, a client side mapping solution is both sexier and more practical (no need for dedicated map data files or assemblies on your own machines) but semantically they provide the same information. Same thing goes for Virtual Places, except that Virtual Places is also pulling both functionality (i.e. the mapping component) as well as data (i.e. blogs and photos) from other sites across the Internet. Could that be done on the server side? You betcha. Would it be as cool or functional? No. Does that make it a completely different type of application that deserves a new name. IMO, no. These are component based apps - they just use the browser as the platform and the components are coming across the web (as you would expect when you use the browser as a platform).</p><p>The higher order bit for me is who controls the experience. For apps like Zvents and VirtualPlaces, it's the application developer. For something like <a href="http://live.com/">Live.com</a>, it's me. I decide what to put on my Live page. Not that one is more important than the other or that they aren't compatible experiences - I could easily imagine a Zvents <a href="http://microsoftgadgets.com/">gadget</a> that lived in Live.com. Or consuming the RSS feed from Zvents in Live.com. Or a generic iCal gadget that could consume a Zvents iCal feed. But the point is that there are large differences between browser component based application like Zvents and a user managed composite browser application like Live.com. </p><p>To me, composite apps like Live.com fit better to the original definition of mashup than something like Zvents or Virtual Places. They both have their place and their value, but I like to call things that are different by different names in order to reduce confusion.</p><p>Of course, composite apps aren't limited to the browser. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/">p&amp;p</a> just shipped their <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c">Composite UI Application Block</a> last week. I dug into it a bit last week and it's awesome. More on that later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Thoughts on CAB</title>
		<link>http://devhawk.net/2005/11/23/thoughts-on-cab/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>As I wrote earlier, I'm really impressed with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices">p&amp;p</a>'s latest release - the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/cabctp.asp">Composite UI Application Block</a>. I had to fly to Atlanta for a customer meeting last week and I spent most of my spare time (flying, in hotel, etc) digging thru CAB. Well, digging through CAB and reading <a href="http://www.crichton-official.com/fear/index.html">State of Fear</a> by <a href="http://www.crichton-official.com/">Michael Crichton</a>. IMO, it's his best book in quite a while, perhaps second best he's ever written after Jurassic Park.</p><p>Back to CAB. First off, I want more information about ObjectBuilder. p&amp;p's dependency injection framework is very impressive. However, with the exception of the code, the code reference in the help files, the unit tests, and a single article on how it was designed there just isn't much info on it. For example, I <i>know</i> I can use it to inject a concrete type where a class is expecting an abstract type. But I couldn't figure out how so I went and asked <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/">Peter</a> and <a href="http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/">Brad</a>. (Short answer - use TypeMappingPolicy). Do me a favor, go contact <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/contact.aspx">Peter</a> and <a href="http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/contact.aspx">David</a> and tell them you want more info on ObjectBuilder. Sample code especially. Go on, drop them a line right now while you're thinking about it. I'll wait.</p><p>Back already? Cool. One thing you can't help but notice about CAB (and OB for that matter) is the heavy use of attributes, which I feel is an extremely elegant solution. Remember the first time you looked at <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a>? How <i>sensible </i>it seemed to use attributes like [TestFixture], [Test] and [ExpectedException] compared to what other xUnit frameworks provide? Get ready to experience that all over again when you look at OB and CAB. Now you're looking at attributes like [CreateNew], [EventPublication] and [CommandHandler]. There's a reason why Sun <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html">cloned attributes</a> for J2SE 5.0 - it's powerful (in the right hands). The attributes both drive human readability - when you're looking at a property adorned with [CreateNew] or [Dependency] it's obvious that these are injected - as well as the implementation. Win-win as far as I'm concerned.</p><p>CAB does a great job of codifying standard patterns in smart client design, such as events, commands and controllers, as well as implementing completely new ideas such as workspaces, work items and smart parts. And they've done it with an eye on the future. I love the isolation between the windows forms specific parts of CAB and the underlying infrastructure of CAB. Check out <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/cabcbt_02.png">this picture</a> of the layers of CAB. By isolating all the WinForms specific stuff in a separate assembly, they are well set up to support <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/presentation/">WPF</a> while minimizing redundant effort. I can't wait to see a Microsoft.Practices.CompositeUI.Avalon project (because Microsoft.Practices.CompositeUI.WindowsPresentationFoundation is just to long a namespace).</p><p>However, I can't shake the feeling of how complex this stuff is. Yeah, you use CAB for solving complex problems, but there is a significant learning curve here. I imagine debugging a CAB app will be significantly non-trivial. Take a look at the final step of the walkthru app. Here's the sequence that gets "hello world" painted on the screen:</p><ol><li>Main entrypoint creates and runs the ShellApplication.</li><li>ShellApplication creates a ShellForm window, which in turn contains the tabWorkspace1 workspace.</li><li>ShellApplication dynamically loads MyModule because it's listed in the ProfileCatalog.xml file.</li><li>CAB creates an instance of the MyModuleInit class from the MyModule assembly.</li><li>MyModuleInit creates and runs an instance of MyWorkItem.</li><li>MyWorkItem creates a MyView and MyPresenter.</li><li>MyWorkItem adds the MyView instance to the tabWorkspace1 workspace, hosted in the ShellForm</li><li>MyPresenter handles the MyView load event and sets the message property of MyView to "Hello, World"</li></ol><p>Of course, the point of a demo app like the walkthru is comprehension. You would never use CAB to build this Hello World app. But I worry that the level of complexity will put CAB beyond the reach or inclination on many potential users. I imagine this single line of code will scare off many would-be CAB developers:</p><p style="FONT-FAMILY: courier new"><span style="COLOR: #008080">MyWorkItem</span> myWorkItem = parentWorkItem.WorkItems.AddNew&lt;<span style="COLOR: #008080">MyWorkItem</span>&gt;();</p><p>Given that most people are used to writing "<span style="FONT-FAMILY: courier new"><span style="COLOR: blue">new</span><span style="COLOR: #008080">MyWorkItem</span>()</span>", the line above represents a significantly rise in complexity. Of course, CAB is trying to solve a complex problem. I'm sure CAB's designers would rather the solution wasn't so complex, but that's the reality of the problem space their dealing with. </p><p>If you can't lower the complexity of your framework, it's time to raise the abstraction of your tools. </p><p>I wonder what CAB specific tooling would look like? At a minimum, it would like built in support for the primary concepts in CAB - WorkItem, SmartPart, Workspace and Service to name a few. Another opportunity would be to move from embedded strings, used to identify events, commands, UIExtensionSites and the like to true variable-style names that could be validated at compile time, sort of like how LINQ is extending C# to get rid of embedded database query commands. There's lots of possibilities and the more I work w/ CAB the better idea I'll have about them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I too have been very impressed by CAB. I learned about it very late, at Code Camp Seattle. I spent about a week or two totally into it, trying to understand everything about it.

I was also a little scared by the complexity. I had the good fortune of working on a project very simmilar to what CAB does, only in .NET 1.1, earlier this year. I would say that application was 120% the complexity of CAB, maybe because the developers weren't charged with building something as polished for general use as CAB. It also lacked some of the really neato features of the CAB, like OB, because they weren't neccesary for what they were doing.

If the CAB saves some teams the effort that went into building the framework I got to work with earlier this year (maybe 10 developers * 4 months), then I would have to conclude that the CAB is a huge benefit for the community.

Finally, I hesitate to agree that raising the abstraction level of tools is a good idea. That's just hiding the complexity that's already there inside of more complexity. If you ever need to look under the hood, it's even harder to grok. I think it would be better to go the other way. Try removing stuff to combat complexity.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://www.factored-software.com/iimplement">Chris Bilson</a> left the following <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,6e17873f-9d5b-401e-a9b4-609394e97e3f.aspx">comment</a> to my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/11/23/Thoughts+On+CAB.aspx">Thoughts on CAB</a> post</p><blockquote><p>I hesitate to agree that raising the abstraction level of tools is a good idea. That's just hiding the complexity that's already there inside of more complexity. If you ever need to look under the hood, it's even harder to grok. I think it would be better to go the other way. Try removing stuff to combat complexity.</p></blockquote><p>Given that the software industry has been raising the level of abstraction of tools since the start, I found this comment surprising. Assuming Chris doesn't write in assembly code, he's leveraging something at a higher level of abstraction that's "just hiding the complexity that's already there". As I wrote in <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/10/05/Code+Is+Model.aspx">Code is Model</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The only code that the CPU can understand is machine code. But nobody wants to write and debug all their code using 0’s and 1’s. So we move up a level of abstraction and use a language that humans can read more easily and that can be automatically translated (i.e. compiled) into machine code the CPU can execute. The simplest step above machine code is assembly language. <b>But ASM isn't particularly productive so work with, so the industry has continuously raised the level of abstraction in the languages they use. C is a higher level of abstraction than ASM, adding concepts like types and functions. C++ is a higher level of abstraction than C, adding concepts like classes and inheritance. Each of these levels of abstraction presents a new model of the execution environment with new features that make programming more productive (and sometimes <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/09/08/Portability+Without+Productivity.aspx">more portable</a>)</b>. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote><p>I feel like Chris has mischaracterized what I wrote. Here it is again:</p><blockquote><p>If you can't lower the complexity of your framework, it's time to raise the abstraction of your tools.</p></blockquote><p>Note I'm not advocating raising the level of abstraction for abstractions sake. Believe me, I'm hate overly complex code. The project I've been on (and can blog about soon I hope) had a tone of overly complex code that wasn't particularly germane to solving the problem. I yanked all that code and have reduced the framework to a quarter it's original size while adding functionality. But the reality is, simplification can't <i>always</i> be achieved by removing code. To <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_Razor">paraphrase Albert Einstein</a>, solutions to problems should be as simple as possible,<i> but no simpler</i>. </p><p>CAB is the simplest solution to the problem it addresses, and no simpler. Since we can't make CAB simpler and still solve the problem, the <i>only</i> alternative we have is to have the tools hide that complexity. Given how well this has worked in the past, I see no reason why it can't work again in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">I asked Scoble for his thoughts on my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/11/22/I+Hate+The+Term+Mashup.aspx">post about the term mashup</a>, and he decided simply to <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/11/22/the-non-gym-plan/">link to it</a>. While I appreciate the traffic, I'd appreciate opinions even more. Luckily, in the same post he linked to <a href="http://samus.typepad.com/what/">Sam Ramji</a> writing about what he called "<a href="http://samus.typepad.com/what/2005/11/scoble_intervie.html">enterprise mashups</a>". Again, love the idea but hate the name mashup.</p><p align="left">According to Sam, Scoble said: </p><blockquote><p align="left">[W]hat's to prevent mash-ups from being <strong>the main way that departmental apps are built</strong> in most enterprises 3-4 years from now?</p></blockquote><p align="left">Again, it depends on the definition of the term "mashup". Are we're talking about browser component based apps that leverage what <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/11/07/what-do-you-call-things-like-flickr-microsoft-gadgets-google-maps-amazon-affiliate-parts/">Scoble calls ICC's</a>? If so, Scoble is only wrong about the timeframe. My team has a browser based application leveraging <a href="http://virtualearth.msn.com/">Virtual Earth</a> running on our intranet server <i>right now</i>. </p><p align="left">Quick terminology sidebar: I use the term browser based application to refer to these AJAX and mashup style apps, since they download code and run in the browser itself. By comparison, I use the term web based application for the more traditional browser apps that did all the processing on the server and used the browser essentially as a dumb terminal.</p><p align="left">While I think these browser based applications will go mainstream in the enterprise soon, there are a couple of things holding up adoption: availability of tools and of the components themselves. </p><p align="left">On the tools side, the AJAX programming model is just too difficult for most programmers. Rudimentary debugging support, late bound script languages, no compiler to help you find errors. Sounds like web development circa 1997, doesn't it? I'm hoping <a href="http://atlas.asp.net/">Atlas</a> will be to AJAX what ASP.NET was to ASP. </p><p align="left">As for existing components, most of the ones <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/11/07/what-do-you-call-things-like-flickr-microsoft-gadgets-google-maps-amazon-affiliate-parts/">Scoble calls out</a> have little relevance to the enterprise. There's little point to a Feedmap or a Flickr bar in my enterprise app. And I'm not sure I even want to go into the implications of serving up ads in an enterprise app. That pretty much leaves mapping components like VE and Google Maps as the only browser components of interest to the enterprise developer. So far anyway.</p><p align="left">I wonder if Scoble knows of any other enterprise relevant browser components out there?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He in this case is <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/timmall">Tim Mallalieu</a> from the data programmability team. He and I used to work on the .NET Adoption Team in the field together before we both moved to campus. Tim, if I recall correctly, was the first outside hire we made on that team. We used to constantly argue about who was the second smartest on the team. He thought it was me and I thought it was him. We both agreed the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jeromyc">Jeromy</a> was the smartest.</p><p>Anyway, after literally years of haranguing, Tim finally started a <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/timmall">blog</a>. But he's still not really listening to me. I told him he should start with a series of smaller posts and he <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/timmall/archive/2005/11/23/496262.aspx">didn't</a>.  </p><p>I'm back working with Tim in a fashion as both my team and his team try and get a handle on how data is going to evolve as we move to service orientation. Most of the existing data paradigms and semantics such as table joins and transactions assume everything is together in one database. Obviously, as we break down large systems into smaller services, having everything in one database just isn't practical. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you tell it's a slow day in the office? :)</p><p>Speaking of raising the level of abstraction as well as browser based applications, check out Nikhil's <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/Project.JSUtils.aspx">JavaScript Utilities project</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>The project introduces the notion of .jsx (extended JavaScript) and .jsa (JavaScript assembly) files. JSX files provide the ability to include conditional code via familiar preprocessor directives such as #if, #else, #endif and so on...The tool processes these directives in order to produce a standard .js file. JSA files build on top of .jsx files. While they can include normal JavaScript and preprocessor directives, they are primarily there for including individual .jsx and .js files via #include directives. This allows you to split your script into more manageable individual chunks.</p></blockquote><p>Now, that's not raising the level of abstraction much, but here's another example of working in a higher abstracted environment (jsx and jsa) and then compiling down to something the underlying platform can execute (js). Nikhil provides three ways of doing this compliation:</p><ol><ol><li>A set of standalone tools that output standard .js files that you can then deploy to your web site. Command line parameters are used to control the behavior of the tools. 
</li><li>A couple of IHttpHandler implementations that allow you to dynamically convert your code into standard .js files. This is the mode where you can benefit from implementing per-browser code in a conditional manner. AppSetting values in configuration are used to control the conversion behavior. 
</li><li>As a script project in VS using an msbuild project along with an msbuild task that comes along with the project. MSBuild project properties are used to control the conversion behavior. </li></ol></ol><p>If you're going to raise the level of abstraction to do implement a preprocessor, you could also go all the way and implement an entirely new language that gets compiled down to JavaScript for execution in the browser. For example, I'm not as familiar or comfortable with JavaScript's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototype based approach</a>. But I could imagine a more class based language that compiles to JavaScript. That's the same way early C++ compilers worked - they were a preprocessor pass that converted the C++ into C, which could then be compiled with traditional C compilers. </p><p>I wonder what JavaScript++ would look like</p>]]></content:encoded>

How silly is that.</p><p __designer:dtid="281474976710673">Juha-Pekka Tovanen quoted me from my OOPSLA panel as saying that "when the project gets closer to the delivery you normally throw away UML models." </p><p __designer:dtid="281474976710674">&lt;snip&gt;</p><p __designer:dtid="281474976710675">Let me be excruciatingly clear: Over the years I have been consistent in saying that in a) the most important artifact of any software development organization is executable code and yet b) modeling is essential in constructing such executables. This is because c) models help us reason about, specify, construct, and document software-intensive systems at levels of abstraction that transcend source code (and the UML is the accepted open standard for doing so). That being said, it is a pragmatic reality that d) some models are essential (and should be retained) while others are simply scaffolding (and should be discarded). I have never said and do not say now that one should throw away all models, as Juha-Pekka then Harry then Steve imply.</p></blockquote><p __designer:dtid="281474976710676" xmlns:__designer="#unknown">First off, Grady claiming to be misquoted his pretty disingenuous. Juha-Pekka's account of what Grady said on the panel is pretty spot on. Furthermore, Grady claming that I implied he said "throw away all models" is also disingenuous. I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/11/07/Grady+Booch+Sez+Throw+Models+Away.aspx" __designer:dtid="281474976710677">specifically wrote</a> that I thought Grady was being taken out of context:</p><blockquote __designer:dtid="281474976710678" xmlns:__designer="#unknown"><p __designer:dtid="281474976710679">I've gotta believe that this comment was somehow taken out of context and that the Grand Poobah of the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/12/10/Booch+On+DSLs+Round+3.aspx" __designer:dtid="281474976710680">Common Semantic Model</a> doesn't actually believe that tossing the model at the end of the project is a good thing. </p></blockquote><p __designer:dtid="281474976710681" xmlns:__designer="#unknown">But he-said/she-said nitpicking aside, where's the guidance on which models are essential and which are "simply scaffolding". Last time I checked the UML spec, none of the models are labeled as disposable. How about Rational Rose? Any dialog boxes that pop up reading: "Don't worry keeping this model up to date, it's just scaffolding"? I don't think so.</p><p __designer:dtid="281474976710682" xmlns:__designer="#unknown">Obviously, working at a higher level of abstraction helps you reason about a project. But reasoning at high levels of abstraction doesn't mean you're modeling. When a building architect sits down with a prospective customer and a sketchpad, they may be working out great ideas but no one is going to call the result a blueprint. Grady's scaffolding "models" break nearly every tenant of <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/10/05/Code+Is+Model.aspx" __designer:dtid="281474976710683">Code is Model</a>. Scaffolding isn't precise or deterministic. And if it ends up in the recycle bin, I guess it's not intrinsic to the development process. </p><p __designer:dtid="281474976710684" xmlns:__designer="#unknown">Actually, it's good that scaffolding isn't a model. It means Grady is specifically <em __designer:dtid="281474976710685">not</em> suggesting to<em __designer:dtid="281474976710686"></em>throw away models. He just needs to get his terminology right.</p><p __designer:dtid="281474976710687" xmlns:__designer="#unknown">As for Grady's request for "just one DSM out there in production", Don <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/12/14/17469.aspx" __designer:dtid="281474976710688">lists a few</a>: Workflow languages (XLANG and WF), Business Rules Engine Languages and Build lanugages (MSBuild, Ant and NAnt). Juha-Pekka pointed to this list of <a href="http://www.dsmforum.org/cases.html">DSM case studies</a>. I'd also add UI Designers such as the Windows Forms and ASP.NET designers in Visual Studio. In the Window Forms case, the code is stored in a seperate file (yay partial classes) and are specifically marked: "do not modify the contents of this method with the code editor." In the ASP.NET case, the code for an ASPX file isn't even generated until runtime. And how about HTML itself? I'm thinking HTML qualifies as "in production"? </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Imprecise vs. Incomplete</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj">Gareth</a> responds to the first tenet of <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/10/05/Code+Is+Model.aspx">Code is Model</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[A]lthough as an industry we desperately need to drag models kicking and screaming from the far left of pretty-picturedom a good long way to the right in the direction of precision, I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>I'm going to take it as a given that folks believe that precise models are valuable development artefacts. Why do I think imprecise models are also valuable? Here are three things that tools for imprecise models help you to do:</p><ol style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px" type="1"><li>Communicate with people about design </li><li>Think out loud in a way that's more shareable that your whiteboard </li><li>Start with an imprecise model and progress gradually toward precise models</li></ol><p>Hopefully the first of these is obvious - there is value in model as communication device - it's just not enormous.  I've <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2004/10/13/241985.aspx">talked before about the value</a> of the second - I draw pictures on my whiteboard and when I'm on a conference call to Redmond, they're effectively useless.</p><p>The third is something I've only recently become a convert to.  I'm happy to have models which are not precise so long as I can still reason about them programmatically.  This allows me to have development processes that are about a quantitive process of iterative refinement.</p><p>Here's an example - in some infrastructure modelling tool, I have a node type which specifies a logical machine group.  One of its properties is the number of actual machines required to suit the proposed scale of the application to be deployed.  I'd like to be able to put "Depends on outcome of Fred's scalability investigation" into that numeric field, or perhaps "4-&gt;8".  I can still generate a pretty good report from this model, but I can't really provision a set of physical servers from it.</p><p>But here's the kicker - it's vital that I can write tools that programmatically assess this model and tell me what work needs to be done in order to make it precise.  I want to know exactly what must be done on this model before, for example, it is suitable for feeding into some kind of provisioning tool.  You might say it needs to be precisely imprecise; I prefer to think of it as quantifiable imprecision.</p><p></p><p>[<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/12/07/imprecisehippies.aspx">Imprecise Models and Killing Hippies</a>]</p></blockquote><p>The only thing I disagree with Gareth about is terminology. Like the term architecture, model has become a catch-all for things that aren't code. Regular readers of this blog know I like to be more precise than that. As such, I think items #1 and #2 from Gareth's list aren't actually models at all. I think of them as pseudomodels, similar to the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>. Actually, I like the name pseudomodel - it also applies well to <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/12/17/Scaffolding+Isnt+A+Model.aspx">Grady's scaffolding</a>. Like psuedocode, pseudomodels have tons of value in communication and reasoning about a problem but they can't be used as development artifacts. </p><p>As for the third, I think what Gareth is describing is an incomplete model, rather than an imprecise one. If the model is imprecise, there's no way to programmatically reason about it. But if we look to code as an example, obviously, there are many cases where code is incomplete. Every compiler error you've ever seen is an example of incomplete code. And because the language is precisely specified, the compiler can tell you what needs to be done in order to make it precise, exactly as Gareth requested. I don't think of writing code as "progressing gradually towards precision" and I doubt anyone else does either. And while I do see development as an "iterative process", I don't think of it as "iterative refinement". Modeling shouldn't be any different.</p><p>One area where I do see refinement being critical is in the development of the modeling language itself. Traditionally, the language stays stable while the program written with it changes. But with the introduction of DSLs, it becomes possible for both to vary independently. I would assume that a DSL would evolve over time to have better "coverage" of a given domain. For example, if I was building a <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/11/23/Thoughts+On+CAB.aspx">CAB DSL</a>, I would implement support for WorkItem right off the bat, but supporting WorkItemExtension would be much lower on the priority list. This represents language refinement, but I would argue it's a refinement of coverage not a refinement of precision. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the cool things about having a blogging conversation with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj">someone on the other side of the world</a> is that while you sleep they are thinking of a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/12/19/505732.aspx">good response</a> to your post. The only downside? Having to deal with rampant misspelling like "artefacts". :)</p><p align="left">Anyway, Gareth responds to <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/12/19/Imprecise+Vs+Incomplete.aspx">my post</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Until we get models that are perfectly aligned with our business domains, we'll have people who want to create models but who get them slightly wrong from a precision point of view - usually in the places where the imperfect models interact with other aspects of the system across or down the abstraction stack.</p><p>With code, you'd likely not want to have people check in sources that don't even compile and then hand them off to other folks who do make them compile, but I think that's exactly the type of process we'll see emerging in modelling for a while. I feel this way because I don't foresee us getting modelling languages of <i>pure business intent</i> 100% right for some time yet - we're simply not close enough to formal enough descriptions of systems as intensely human as a business yet. However, I hope we won't want to try and keep modelling as locked away with the techies as traditional development has been. (Hope I'm not talking myself out of a job here…)</p><p>[<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/12/19/505732.aspx">Pseudomodels and intent</a>]</p></blockquote><p>I keep saying incomplete and Gareth keeps saying imprecise, but I think we can both agree on the term "imperfect". There's a massive difference between having an precise language that is imperfect versus a language that is inherently imprecise like UML. </p><p>However, I think the primary disconnect here has to do with Gareth and my views on how higher abstracted languages will evolve. Gareth's comments about modeling "pure business intent", having "models that are perfectly aligned with our business domains" and not "keep[ing] modelling as locked away with the techies" imply to me that Gareth wants to work down from the high level business abstractions into implementable technical abstractions. Frankly, I don't think that's very likely. Leapfrogging a few levels of abstraction hasn't worked well in the past (CASE and UML/MDA) and I don't think it will work well now. </p><p>I find it much more likely that we will build higher level abstractions directly on top of existing abstractions. Again, this is similar to the way C++ built on C which in turn built on ASM. Sure, that could keep modeling "locked away with the techies" for a while, but we're already beginning to see the light at the end of that tunnel. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/workflow/default.aspx">Windows Workflow Foundation</a> is a significant leap in abstraction while also being something than non-techies can use. Reports about about Sharepoint "12" embedding the WF engine and FrontPage "12" providing a Workflow Designer for building SharePoint workflows. While I imagine (and I haven't used any of the new Office "12" suite so this is pure conjecture) these WF tools are targeting the "power user", they certainly aren't only for developers. </p><p>Believe me, I would love to be wrong about this. I would much rather work down from or business user intent than up from the technical foundation. I just don't think it's feasible. The process Gareth describes breaks the "Model Transformation must be Deterministic" tenet of <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/10/05/Code+Is+Model.aspx">Code is Model</a>, though the word "must" may be to strong to allow for language evolution. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While my blog was down, Microsoft launched the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/xbox360/">Xbox 360</a> with significant fanfare and dramatic demand. Of course, a month later the Xbox 360 is still <a href="http://bensbargains.net/xbox360/xbox360.php">sold out</a> pretty much <span class="SpellE">every where</span> you go. I remember I got able to find an original Xbox before Christmas back in 2001 so either the demand is much higher or the supply is much <span class="GramE">lower</span> (probably both). I've personally decided to wait on getting a 360 - I'm way behind on original Xbox games and my <a href="http://storage.msn.com/x1pFeqfYuS6GVACJn9mvD1nrS9Ut2YqkWWLeyDj-jjA1Vlz-sbk7qMMCGGYMaLCUAbJtUaD0FbymyD_HYC7NdAPWETpzHTA7PzW9zlvfjQYbDGu0c2PO2PpW8hz2FarO0oH">two kids</a> don't leave much playtime anyway. But I'm certainly in the minority on this one.</p><p>Anyway, at the height of the frenzy a couple days after launch, <a href="http://www.johnporcaro.com/">John Porcaro</a> wrote what I thought was <a href="http://www.johnporcaro.com/2005/11/index.html">an amazing post</a> about the difficulties of marketing a product like Xbox 360. I mean, we're all acutely aware of the technical challenges of designing a hardware product like Xbox 360 or a software service like Xbox Live. Maybe that time in marketing rotted my brain, but the challenge John describes is significant. </p><p>Furthermore, I think John really lays it out there in his post. It may not have been good news (i.e. Xbox 360 shortages for the near-term future) but it was open and forthright about where Microsoft is with the Xbox 360 and how Microsoft wants Xbox to grow.</p><p>(Note: AFAIK, I am not getting a free Xbox 360 from John for writing this.)</p>]]></content:encoded>
