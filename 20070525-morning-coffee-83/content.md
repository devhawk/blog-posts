-   PDC07 has been
    “[rescheduled](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/events/bb288534.aspx)“.

    [Software+Services](http://www.ftponline.com/channels/arch/reports/eas/2007/jdevadoss/) @

    their [Perf Testing
    Guide](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmeier/archive/2007/05/25/performance-testing-guide-beta-1-is-available.aspx).
