<p>Now that we have built the brokered component , we have to build a
proxy/stub for it. Proxies and stubs are how WinRT method calls are
marshalled across process boundaries. If you want to know more – or you
have insomnia – feel free to read <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms692621(v=vs.85).aspx">all the gory details up on
MSDN</a>.</p>
<p>Proxies and stubs look like they might be scary, but they’re actually
trivial (at least in the brokered component scenario) because 100% of
the code is generated for you. It couldn’t be much easier.</p>
<p>Right click the solution node and select Add -&gt; New Project.
Alternatively, you can select File -&gt; New -&gt; Project in the Visual
Studio main menu, but if you do that make sure you change the default
solution from “Create new Solution” to “Add to Solution”. Regardless of
how you launch the new project wizard, search for “broker” again, but
this time select the “Brokered Windows Runtime ProxyStub” template. Give
the project a name – I chose “HelloWorldBRT.PS”.</p>

</div>
<p>Once you’ve created the proxy/stub project, you need to set a reference to
the brokered component you created in step 1. Since proxies and stubs
are native, this is a VC++ project. Adding a reference in a VC++ is not
as straightforward as it is in C# projects. Right click the proxy/stub
project, select “Properties” and then select Common Properties -&gt;
References from the tree on the left. Press the “Add New Reference…”
button to bring up the same Add Reference dialog you’ve seen in managed
code projects. Select the brokered component project and press OK.</p>
<p>Remember when I said that 100% of the code for the proxy/stub is
generated? I wasn’t kidding – creating the template and setting
referencing the brokered component project is literally all you need to
do. Want proof? Go ahead and build now. If you watch the output windows,
you’ll see a bunch of output go by referencing IDL files and MIDLRT
among other stuff. This proxy/stub template has some custom MSBuild
tasks that generates the proxy/stub code using winmdidl and midlrt. The
process is similar to what is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn481253.aspx">described
here</a>. BTW, if
you get a chance, check out the proxy/stub project file – it is a work
of art. Major props to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kieran-mockford/4/77/110">Kieran
Mockford</a> for his
msbuild wizardry.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s not enough just to build the proxy/stub – you also have to register
it. The brokered component proxy/stub needs to be registered globally on
the machine, which means you have to be running as an admin to do it. VS
can register the proxy/stub for you automatically, but that means you
have to run VS as an administrator. That always makes me nervous, but if
you’re OK with running as admin you can enable proxy/stub registration
by right clicking the proxy/stub project file, selecting Properties,
navigating to Configuration properties -&gt; Linker -&gt; General in the
tree of the project properties page, and then changing Register Output
to “Yes”.</p>
<p>If you don’t like running VS as admin, you can manually register the
proxy/stub by running <code>regsvr32 &lt;proxystub dll&gt;</code> from an elevated
command prompt. Note, you do have to re-register every time the public
surface area of your brokered component changes so letting VS handle
registration admin is definitely the easier route to go.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2014/04/25/brokered-winrt-components-step-three">third and final
step</a>,
we’ll build a client app that accesses our brokered component.</p>
