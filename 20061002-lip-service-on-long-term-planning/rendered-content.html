<p>Long term readers know my liberal political leanings. So it should come
as no surprise to them that I read liberal blogs like Washington
Monthly. But this isn’t a post about politics, it’s a post about
planning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This kind of long-term planning — in politics, in business, in nearly
every walk of life — is something that nearly everyone <em>says</em> they
support, but when push comes to shove very few people are willing to
back it up. There’s always something this week, or this month, or this
year that seems uniquely crucial and demands our attention. Next year
there will be something else, and the year after that something else
again. The long-term stuff simply never gets done unless someone like
Dean is willing to go to the mat for it.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>I don’t have much to add to this, except that planning is a big part of
architecture, especially architecture in the enterprise (which may or
may not be “Enterprise Architecture”). Who “goes to the mat” for the
long-term stuff at your company? Or does the long-term stuff simply
never get done?</p>
