<p>We just published a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/entarch.asp">white
paper</a>
about the Enterprise Architectural Space Organizing Table. Basically,
this is a table for categorizing architectural artifacts such as
patterns. It owes a great deal to Zachman, but really builds out the
concepts of roles and viewpoints. In addition to the white paper, you
can get a PDF of <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/C/4/0C44F7EB-893F-4048-B2C6-C1C889E06DF1/MOAG_F02.pdf">the table
itself</a>.</p>
<p>What’s ultra-cool about this table is that it’s what the
<a href="http://microsoft.com/practices">p&amp;p</a> group uses internally. The white
paper maps <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx">every pattern MSFT has
published</a>
into the table. You can also see the EASOT viewpoints in action in the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/intpatt-ch07.asp">Project
Notebook</a> section
of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/intpatt.asp">Integration
Patterns</a>.
When I saw a print of the table hanging on the wall in p&amp;p’s building, I
knew I wanted to see it published online. Love it or hate it, it’s real.</p>
<p>What do you think? Obviously, we’re planning on building on EASOT going
forward. Is this useful? Valuable? </p>
