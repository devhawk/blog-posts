My old team decided to post the slides from my sessions at the [Gartner
EA Summit last
month](http://devhawk.net/2006/06/26/gartner-ea-summit-day-two/).
Well, they’ve posted PDF versions of said slides and the fonts are
somewhat off, but you’ll get the idea.

If you’re interested in more info on the Dell Integrated Desktop, you

FYI, Gartner recorded audio for these sessions and supposedly it’s on
its way to me. I’ll try and post the audio with synced slides as soon as
I can.
