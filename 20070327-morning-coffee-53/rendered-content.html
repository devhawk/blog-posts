<li>The Virtual PC 2007 virtual video card seems to max out @ 1600 x
1200 resolution. Given that the two screens on my main dev
workstation are 1200×1600 (i.e. portait mode) and 1680×1050, it
means I can’t run VPC in full screen on my dev box. I can get close
on the widescreen monitor, but I like writing code on the portain
monitor better. Luckily, I can use remote desktop instead the built
in VPC display window in order to get full screen on either monitor.</li>
<li>Soma
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/03/26/visual-studio-turns-10.aspx">announces</a>
the aquisition and immediate (i.e. free) availability of Teamplain
web client for VSTS as part of Visual Studio’s 10th birthday. We’re
also “publishing the Orcas Wave (Orcas + Rosario) <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/teamsystem/bb407307.aspx">roadmap for
VSTS</a>.” I’ll be
interested to see the reaction to that. Mike’s <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1107.aspx">reaction to the
schedule</a> was:
“That’s insane”.</li>
<li>THe XNA tools just keep coming. Allegorithmic’s MaPZone texture
creation tool <a href="http://www.mapzoneeditor.com/?PAGE=COMMUNITY.XNA">is free to XNA
developers</a>.
Actually, it looks like it’s <a href="http://www.mapzoneeditor.com/">free for
everyone</a>, as a carrot to upgrade to
their procedural texture tool
<a href="http://www.mapzoneeditor.com/?PAGE=PROFX">ProFX</a>. Still, free tools
are still free. (via <a href="http://klucher.com/archive/2007/03/27/download-mapzone-texture-authoring-tool-for-free.aspx">Michael

<li>Can I get 1200U of rackspace, to go? <a href="http://www.rackable.com/solutions/concentro.htm">Apparently,
yes</a>. (via <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!380.entry">Half My

<li>Watched the season finale of Battlestar Galactica last night. Wow,
is there a better show on TV right now? (yes, one: Lost. But that’s
it) When it ended, my wife said “We have to wait until 2008 for a
new episode? That sucks”. I couldn’t agree more.</li>
