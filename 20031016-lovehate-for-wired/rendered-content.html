<p>Every once in a while, I think about just yanking the Wired feed from my
aggregator. I don’t usually read the articles. With Scoble posting so
much, who has time to read both?
😄
However, today I actually read two. One very interesting and one that I
thought was pretty stupid.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,60836,00.html">Spies Attack White House
Secrecy</a> points
out that document classifications are up 400% from 10 years ago. On the
surface, post 9-11, that may sound like a good idea. But look at the
examples they give:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.csis.org">Center for Strategic and International
Studies</a>, a Washington think tank, prepared a
report last year for firefighters and other so-called “first
responders” on how to react to a chemical weapons attack. But when the
paper was completed, the Defense Department classified it, CSIS
analyst Jim Lewis noted. Now, the firefighters will never get the
benefit of that information.</p>
<p>In July, a George Mason University graduate student mapped out in his
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A23689-2003Jul7&amp;notFound=true">dissertation</a>
(registration required) the details of the country’s fiber optic
network. Using information publicly available online, he spotted
vulnerable spots where terrorists might strike. The paper could have
been used to shore up weak links in the country’s infrastructure.
Instead, the government immediately suppressed it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I particularly liked this quote from the article: “To counter
far-reaching, stealthy terrorist cabals, the country needs more
openness, not less.” Sounds like Scoble’s stance on corporate
transparency.</p>
<p>Then there is <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,60832,00.html">Windows: More Flawed Than
Ever</a>. While
I may be a <a href="default.aspx#disclaimer">biased b0rg</a>, I think this article
offers little in the way of unbiased “news”. Yes, we
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/security_bulletins/20031015_windows.asp">released</a>
four critical and one important updates for Windows yesterday. I’m not
sure what’s “particularly embarrassing” about them. <em>ALL</em> security bugs
are embarrassing. That’s why we work with the security community and get
the stuff patched in a timely fashion, usually before anyone knows it’s
a problem.</p>
