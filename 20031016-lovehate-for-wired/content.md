Every once in a while, I think about just yanking the Wired feed from my
aggregator. I don’t usually read the articles. With Scoble posting so
much, who has time to read both?
:smile:
However, today I actually read two. One very interesting and one that I
thought was pretty stupid.

[Spies Attack White House
Secrecy](http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,60836,00.html) points
out that document classifications are up 400% from 10 years ago. On the
surface, post 9-11, that may sound like a good idea. But look at the
examples they give:

> The [Center for Strategic and International
> Studies](http://www.csis.org), a Washington think tank, prepared a
> report last year for firefighters and other so-called “first
> responders” on how to react to a chemical weapons attack. But when the
> paper was completed, the Defense Department classified it, CSIS
> analyst Jim Lewis noted. Now, the firefighters will never get the
> benefit of that information.
>
> In July, a George Mason University graduate student mapped out in his
> [dissertation](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A23689-2003Jul7&notFound=true)
> (registration required) the details of the country’s fiber optic
> network. Using information publicly available online, he spotted
> vulnerable spots where terrorists might strike. The paper could have
> been used to shore up weak links in the country’s infrastructure.
> Instead, the government immediately suppressed it.

I particularly liked this quote from the article: “To counter
far-reaching, stealthy terrorist cabals, the country needs more
openness, not less.” Sounds like Scoble’s stance on corporate
transparency.

Then there is [Windows: More Flawed Than
Ever](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,60832,00.html). While
I may be a [biased b0rg](default.aspx#disclaimer), I think this article
offers little in the way of unbiased “news”. Yes, we
[released](http://www.microsoft.com/security/security_bulletins/20031015_windows.asp)
four critical and one important updates for Windows yesterday. I’m not
sure what’s “particularly embarrassing” about them. *ALL* security bugs
are embarrassing. That’s why we work with the security community and get
the stuff patched in a timely fashion, usually before anyone knows it’s
a problem.
