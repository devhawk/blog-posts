<p>I’m having a hard time focusing on work today. I just found out that a
good friend and ex-teammate Robert Satterwhite <a href="http://www.legacy.com/Tribnet/DeathNotices.asp?Page=LifeStory&amp;PersonId=115888841">passed away last
week</a>.</p>
<p>I spent a year on the .NET Adoption Team with Robert back in 2002 &amp; 2003
– basically my last year in the Microsoft field organization. NAT – as
were were known – was a national team of developer and architecture
evangelists, so while we were all teammates, we didn’t see much of each
other in person. However, Rob and I both lived in the Puget Sound area
and called on many of the same customers – I was an architect evangelist
and Robert was a developer evangelist – so we ended up working together
often. We drove together to Olympia many times- he drove and I hacked
code in a kind of strange pair programming effort.</p>
<p>Robert grew up in the Pacific NW and had spent almost his entire career
as an enterprise technology sales engineer here, so he had friends
everywhere. I often used the lame line from the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092925/">Dragnet
movie</a> with Dan Aykroyd: “They
ought to put you in Missing Persons. You know everybody.” because it
seemed like everywhere we went we’d run into someone he grew up with,
had worked with or had sold to. If we hung around before or after a
sales call – coffee shop in Olympia before a meeting, debriefing with
the sales rep on the steps outside of Costco HQ in Issaquah, etc –
chances are someone would recognize him.</p>
<p>When I was leaving the NAT, Robert and I went to Phoenix so I could hand
off my customers there to him. I joked that at least I could be sure we
wouldn’t run into anyone he knew in Arizona. Yet, it turned out he used
to work with the woman who was sitting in front of him on the flight
home. She and her husband owned car dealerships in Phoenix and Tacoma. I
was astonished – what are the frakking odds? – but Rob just shrugged his
shoulders. It happened to him all the time so I guess he was used to it.</p>
<p>I only saw him off and on since I left the team, though as fate would
have it I did see him last week on the day he died. I was heading into
building 18 for a meeting as he was pulling into the parking lot – I
hadn’t realized he was working on campus. We exchanged the usual
pleasantries and promised that we’d get together soon. He was blocking
traffic, so it was a short conversation. 24 hours later, he was dead.</p>
<p>Rob wasn’t your prototypical <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecla01/archive/2006/10/31/microsoft-change-the-world-or-go-home.aspx">blue
monster</a>,
but he sure touched a lot of people and he made the world a better place
by just being himself. You will be missed, Rob.</p>
