<p>Today is my daughter Rileyanne’s fourth birthday. She was born on 5-5-05 (at
5:25pm no less!).</p>
<p><a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/">Jules</a> and I were picking out
pictures for Riley’s “birthday ribbon” and we came across this one from
her birthday party weekend before last. We had it a week early because
my mother-in-law had surgery on her foot last week. It was a girls-only
princess tea party, so I didn’t get to see her chasing bubbles in
person. I loved this picture, but we ended up using one where you could
see her face better. Still, I thought it was just too good not to share.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday big girl!</p>
