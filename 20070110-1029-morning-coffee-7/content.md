News was expecting inches, but we only got a dusting of snow last night.

-   We had dinner last night with my old friend
    [Matt](http://technovangelist.com), who [moved to
    Amsterdam](http://technovangelist.com/archive/2005/08/11/14.aspx) a
    year and a half ago and is getting to [travel the
    world](http://technovangelist.com/archive/2006/10/30/Visited-Countries-Getting-Redder.aspx).
    Kids didn’t have a nap yesterday, so they weren’t quite on their
    best behavior, but it was great to see Matt. Hopefully it won’t be
    another 18 months before we see him again.
-   For the second time in four months, the power cable for my laptop
    failed. I wonder if there is something wrong with the power supply
    that’s causing the cable to fail? At least this time I wasn’t [in
    Canada](http://devhawk.net/2006/09/20/hard-on-hardware/).
-   There’s a [high resolution
    video](http://www.xbox.com/NR/rdonlyres/BF491CFF-8B54-4314-9553-FD16F8F8E7B5/0/vidIPTV_InterviewHi.asx)
    of the Xbox 360 IPTV up on [Xbox.com’s CES
    page](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/ces2007). They make
    it *very* clear this is “something you need to get from your service
    provider”. Telling quote: “It’s kinda like what I have today, but
    better”. Doesn’t seem that much better, so far anyway.
-   I’m knee deep in WCF security code again. Mucking about with X.509
    certificates sucks. I tried to follow these
    [directions](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733813.aspx)
    to create a dev root CA certificate as well as dev certs signed by
    said dev root CA, but I get security negotiation errors because the
    system can’t check to see if the cert has been revoked. I guess I’ll
    just install [Certificate
    Services](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376539.aspx)
    instead
-   My nominee for best new acronym:
    [JBOWS](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=790) (Just a
    Bunch of Web Services), apparently coined by [Joe
    McKendrick](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented). Web services,
    to date at least, seem like they’re being used primarily for
    building distributed applications, rather than a loosely coupled
    services. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, unless you’re
    fooling yourself (or those holding the purse strings) that you’ll
    get integration “automagically” or “for free” just because you’re
    using web services. Joe McKendrick is definitely not an
    [SOA-hole](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!271.entry).
-   The next new language I learn will be
    [F\#](http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx). Just not
    sure when or how.
