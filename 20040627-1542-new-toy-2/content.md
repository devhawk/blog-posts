I just picked up a 40GB [Nomad Zen
Xtra](http://www.nomadworld.com/products/Jukebox_ZenXtra/). I know
everyone is all ga-ga for the iPod, but I have all my media in WMA I
found the Nomad for almost half the price of a 40GB iPod. I also picked
up [Notmad Explorer](http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/) which is
[much cooler](http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/ctable.php) than
the built in software. I especially like the Xtreamer capability which
allows you to play music stored on the Nomad thru your computer
speakers. So far, I’ve only filled up 1/3 of the storage – I guess I
need to rip more of my CD collection!
