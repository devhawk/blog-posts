FYI, I’m presenting at the [monthly
meeting](http://www.iasarchitects.org/iasa/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_peid/uemn-84jh-isje-89%3D67yhhk?meeting=38&chapter=9)
of the [International Association of Software
Architects](http://www.iasarchitects.org/) Puget Sound chapter Wed night
(4/27). I’ll be talking about DSLs and Software Factories, including a
hands-on look at the tool. If you’re in the Redmond area, the meeting is
on the Microsoft campus in Building 43, Room 1560 – the Jefferson Room.
