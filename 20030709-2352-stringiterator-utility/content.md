I just posted a cool utility class called
[StringIterator](art_utility.aspx). It is an implementation of a C++
style [random iterator](http://www.cppreference.com/iterators.html) for
a CLR string. I needed it for the project I am working on.

I also reorg-ed my site a bit, all the utility classes are now under the
[Articles section](articles.aspx). Thereâ€™s also a CRC class and a
non-buffered memory stream class available from there. Enjoy.
