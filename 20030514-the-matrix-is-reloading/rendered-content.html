<p>Picked up <a href="http://intothematrixmusic.com/">The Matrix Reloaded
Soundtrack</a> today. Haven’t given it a
full listen, but it’s 2 CD’s and so far I like what I hear. Also
includes the <a href="http://www.intothematrix.com/">Animatrix</a> trailer, <a href="http://www.intothematrix.com/rl_cmp/anime_frames_osiris.html">Final
Flight of
Osiris</a>
trailer, the <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/trailer2_qt.html">Superbowl
trailer</a>
and a documentary on the making of <a href="http://www.enterthematrixgame.com">Enter the
Matrix</a>. Day job stuff tomorrow means
I wont be able to see the movie until Friday. So what will that make me,
the last Microsoft employee in Redmond to see it?</p>
