<p>Back from vacation, caught up on email and weblogs, and ready to code.
<a href="http://aspnetweblog.com/">Scott</a> sent me some of his weblog code to
look at on the plane to Phoenix. How is it that I always seem to work on
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/04/01/blog-specs/">my blog in
Phoenix</a>?
Looking forward to also checking out <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">BlogX
1.1</a> or
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/mgudgin/default.aspx#nn2003-05-01T04:27:40Z">BlogY</a>
or whatever they call it. Also have a few updates to the <a href="prj_sharepointsynd.aspx">SharePoint RSS
feed generator</a> to implement. There’s been
interest inside Microsoft, but I haven’t heard much interest on the
outside.</p>
