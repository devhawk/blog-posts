It may not be [original
anymore](http://www.gazitt.com/OhmBlog/PermaLink.aspx/8e32c6e4-02cd-4eea-91a9-e81b4058ff64),
but I set up a [weblog for my wife Julianne](http://techiewife.com/).
She’s always sending email out to all our friends with updates about our
son, her job and other general goings-on, so I thought writing a weblog
would be a good way for her to keep everyone up to date. She picked the
name TechieWife in order to inspire the wives of techno-geeks
everywhere.
:smile:

I noticed she got the address of my weblog wrong in her inaugural entry.
What’s funny is that my friend Chris Church (no weblog yet) is so lazy
that he bought [devhawk.com](http://devhawk.com/) and set it to redirect
to [devhawk.net](http://devhawk.net/). Now he can use IE’s ctrl-enter
shortcut key to get to my weblog.
