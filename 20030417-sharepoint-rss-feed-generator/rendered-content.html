<p>I just added a project page for my <a href="prj_sharepointsynd.aspx">SharePoint RSS Feed
Generator</a>. Please feel free to download and
test the code. It’s very early code – v0.1 – and I know there are
issues. It passed a basic smoke test with
<a href="http://technovangelist.com/">Matt</a>, but he found some irregularities.
He also suggested enabling RSS feed for individual lists rather than
just for sites. That will be the primary enhancement of a v0.2.</p>
<p>If there’s interest, I can create a <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/">GotDotNet
Workspace</a> for this
project.</p>
