I just added a project page for my [SharePoint RSS Feed
Generator](prj_sharepointsynd.aspx). Please feel free to download and
test the code. It’s very early code – v0.1 – and I know there are
issues. It passed a basic smoke test with
[Matt](http://technovangelist.com/), but he found some irregularities.
He also suggested enabling RSS feed for individual lists rather than
just for sites. That will be the primary enhancement of a v0.2.

If there’s interest, I can create a [GotDotNet
Workspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/) for this
project.
