    "content": "How about using Jabber (or alike) protocol for relaying?\nIt works in distributed way just like email, while it has real-time capabilities, also each user can have infinitely many resource locators (and each user has full control over their addresses), then just setup different apps to listen to a different resource name which is subscribed to whatever publisher.\nIn the end, if your mail/NAT/whatever-publicaly-facing server is Jabber-capable, you have the real-time relay infrastructure in place already. \nMoreover this setup works *everytime* you move your netbook away from home network!\nGoogle uses XMMP even for voice/video communication.\nSo what are we reinventing?",

    "content": "XMPP is still polling. It's not a naive polling, but polling none the less.\nWith the client behind NAT/firewall, there doesn't seem to be any way around that. It's the client who is responsible for initiating request. Even if one uses smart tricks with multiple mini-requests and responses to emulate biderectional communications. It's still synchronous request/response model under the hood.\nOn the other side, if network lattency is low, client and server resources are abundant, and there is no true real-time requirements (all of which is typically the case for all the \"webby\" things), it should suffice for quite a few (if not most) usage scenarios.",
