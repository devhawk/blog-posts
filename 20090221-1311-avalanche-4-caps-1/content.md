Boy, it’s much more fun to write a Caps wrapup [when they
win](http://devhawk.net/2009/02/18/caps-4-canadians-3-so/).

Honestly, the less said about this game, the better. I said at both
intermissions that the Caps were lucky to be tied/down by only one, and
the third period proved me right. Honestly, if I didn’t know the players
and the teams, I wouldn’t have been able to tell which team was \#2 in
the East and which team was \#15 in the West.

The only good things I can say about this game are:

1.  Perfect on the penalty kill, including 43 seconds of 5-on-3
2.  [Backstrom’s
    goal](http://www.nhl.tv/team/console.jsp?hlg=20082009,2,871&event=WSH208)
    was nice
3.  Much better on faceoffs – as a team, we won 60% of them. Only
    Nylander was below 50%. Steckel won 9 of 10
4.  Err, did I mention the Caps were perfect on the PK?

[Japers pointed
out](http://www.japersrink.com/2009/2/20/766648/recap-avs-4-caps-1) that
“the frequency with which these “efforts” are happening that is more
than a little disconcerting.” After last night’s effort plus the 3rd
period effort against Montreal, “more than a little disconcerting” is
spot on.

Next up, Caps play the Penguins tomorrow. The Pens just beat the Flyers
5-4. I didn’t see the whole game but Biron totally botched the play that
lead to the Pens game winning goal. So we have the Pens riding a big win
and the Caps coming off a lackluster performance on national TV. Should
be interesting to say the least. Unfortunately, I’ve got a morning
flight home to Seattle tomorrow, so I’m going to miss it.
