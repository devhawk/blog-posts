for OOPSLA:</p>

<p>In the day-long tutorial that runs on Monday 25<sup>th</sup> (<a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=141">T40 : Using
Domain Specific Languages, Patterns, Frameworks and Tools to Assemble
Applications</a>) we plan
to use a large proportion of the time to walk through a detailed
example of using Software Factories ideas to build four different
variations of the same application. This involves us using some
existing technology, some technology that will ship in Visual Studio
2005 Team System, and some technology that isn’t yet planned, but
which could readily be built by Microsoft or one our partners. As we
plan to show the whole process – from soup (business case, business
capabilities and business processes) to nuts (running code), this
involves a lot of work with help from several teams here at Microsoft.
It is coming together well though, thankfully!</p>
