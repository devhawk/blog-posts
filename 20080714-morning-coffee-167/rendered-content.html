<li>If you’re a gamer, you’re probably already well aware that <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/">E3 is
this week</a>. The
<a href="http://majornelson.com/archive/2008/07/14/demo-too-human.aspx">Too Human
demo</a>
has already been released. I have a friend who’s been working on
“something” that will be announced today (I think).</li>
<li>Live Mesh folks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/archive/2008/07/11/service-update-new-build-new-features-coming-today-0-9-3103-2.aspx">pushed out an
update</a>
Friday. Among the new features is the ability to sync folders among
peers but NOT up to the cloud. This is cool because it means I can
sync my many many GB of pictures and music on my home machine backed
up with Carbonite. This means I can sync them without blowing thru
my 5GB Mesh storage limit.</li>
<li>It looks like there’s a new F# drop –
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/7ac148a7-149b-4056-aa06-1e6754efd36f/Details.aspx">1.9.4.19</a>
– <del>but as usual there is no announcement or details as to what’s
new. Release notes guys, look into it.</del>  <strong>Update</strong>: Don Syme <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/07/14/1-9-4-19-release.aspx">blogged
the
release</a>,
and it’s pretty minor. a .NET FX 3.5 SP1 bug fix, a fix for Mono,
and they removed WebRequest.GetResponseAsync to make F# work on
Silverlight. And the release notes are in the readme. My bad.</li>
<li>Speaking of F#, it was “partially inspired” by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml">OCaml</a>, so when I see papers
related to OCaml, I immediately wonder if I an apply the described
techniques to F#. “<a href="http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Members/David.Teller/publications/ml2008.pdf">Catch me if you can, Towards type-safe,
hierarchical, lightweight, polymorphic and efﬁcient error management
in
OCaml</a>”
is one such paper. (via

<li>Speaking of functional programming, Matthew Podwysocki
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/07/10/aspects-of-functional-programming-in-c-presentation-and-code.aspx">posted</a>
a bunch of FP links as well as a Code Gallery Sample <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/FunctionalCSharp/">on FP in
C#.</a> Good stuff.</li>
<li>As <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/07/14/asp-net-mvc-preview-4-release-part-1.aspx">per Scott
Guthrie</a>,
it looks like there’s a new ASP.NET MVC drop coming this week.</li>

Vinoski</a>,
Google <a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/">Protocol Buffers</a> sounds
like it’s going to be a dud. Note, I haven’t looked at it depth
personally, I’m just passing on opinions of some folks I read and
trust.</li>
<li>Speaking of Dare, both
<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/07/14/ProjectCassandraFacebooksOpenSourceAlternativeToGoogleBigTable.aspx">he</a>
and <a href="http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2008/07/12/FacebookReleasesCassandraAsOpenSource.aspx">James
Hamilton</a>
take a look at
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/the-cassandra-project/">Cassandra</a> and
come away impressed. I wonder how easy it is to code against from
Python and/or .NET?</li>
<li>Bart de Smet has a <a href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2008/07/06/windows-powershell-through-ironruby-writing-a-custom-pshost.aspx">cool
sample</a>
of calling out to PowerShell from IronRuby via the backtick command.
Pretty cool, but it would even cooler to show how to call out to PS
and return .NET objects to Ruby (though that would probably not be
spec compliant for the backtick command).</li>
<li>Here’s a MS code name I had never heard before –
<a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=642">Zermatt</a>.
It’s “a framework for implementing claims-based identity in your
applications.” (via <a href="http://stevegilham.blogspot.com/2008/07/links-for-14-jul.html">Steve
Gilham</a>)</li>
