In our area, finding resources and infrastructure for making independant films is like following a breadcrumb trail - sometimes you get lucky and wind up where you want to be; sometimes you just wind up finding someone's dumpster.\n\nHarry - if the producer is interested in running the film at the Melbourne (Florida) Independant Film Festival, I'm sure it would be welcomed - its next September.  Congrats to your mom-in-law!\n\nChris",
