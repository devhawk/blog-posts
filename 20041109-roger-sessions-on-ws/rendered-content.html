<p><a href="http://www.objectwatch.com/about_us.htm">Roger Sessions</a>, noted
architectural guru, author and Microsoft Architect MVP, has posted his
<a href="http://www.objectwatch.com/newsletters/ObjectWatchNewsletter048.pdf">latest
newsletter</a>
on the WS-* family of specs. In typical Roger fashion, he decides to
give them his own name – WS-SCRAM with SCRAM standing for “Secure,
Coordinated, Reliable Async Messages”. (I forget where, but I once heard
Roger refer to “three-phase transactions” instead of the relatively
standard “two-phase commit transactions”.) Roger claims MS et. al. are
pushing WS-STAR where “STAR” is an acronym standing for “Secure,
Transacted, Async, Reliable”. Personally, I’ve never seen it written out
like a an acronym and I always thought the * in WS-* was used as a
wildcard, but it is true that we are focused more on transactions than
coordination. On the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn">Longhorn
DevCenter</a>, Indigo is
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/pillars/Indigo">described</a>
as providing “secure, reliable, and transacted messaging along with
interoperability.”</p>
<p>This is actually the second time Roger’s taken on transactions in a web
services architecture. His <a href="http://www.objectwatch.com/newsletters/issue_41.htm">last
newsletter</a> on the
topic had a much more detailed but harder to follow example. He points
out that there are two related specs in this space –
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2004/10/ws-atomictransaction/">WS-AtomicTransaction</a>
and
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2004/10/ws-businessactivity/">WS-BusinessActivity</a>
but that he thinks only WS-BA is going to work in the long run. WS-AT
requires holding locks open in the DB, which is highly unlikely between
services in different trust boundaries communicating with async
messaging. Am I really going to lock the records in my database while I
wait for a service that I don’t trust to figure out if it is able to
commit or abort? I don’t think so. Pat’s <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2004/08/12/213552.aspx">wrote a great
scenario</a>
showing how unrealistic the concept of long-running transactions really
are.</p>
<p>However, at the end of the newsletter, Roger takes Indigo to task for
implementing WS-AT and not WS-BA and I don’t agree with him. While I
think WS-AT shouldn’t be used in web services architectures, Indigo is
also responsible for moving existing technologies like COM+ forward.
Leaving out WS-AT isn’t really an option in those scenarios. As for not
implementing WS-BA, I’ve got to wonder just how valuable is WS-BA? While
WS-BA avoids the DB locking issue of WS-AT, it still doesn’t deal with
the delegation of control. WS-BA still leaves me beholden to the
decision of some outside coordinator. This seems to violate two of
<a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox">Don’s</a><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/understanding/pillars/indigo/default.aspx?pull=/msdnmag/issues/04/01/Indigo/default.aspx">tenets of service
orientation</a>:
“Boundaries are Explicit” and “Services are Autonomous”.</p>
