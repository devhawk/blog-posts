IPv6 part means that NATs are a deployment blocker, so

<p>I just noticed this yesterday as well. Very cool stuff. I didn’t realize
that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/techinfo/administration/ipv6/default.asp">XP
SP1</a>
includes a production quality IPv6 stack (though it’s still appears as
“developer preview” in the UI) and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/ipv6/ipv6faq.mspx">Windows Server
2003</a>
takes that support to the next level. Plus <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/productinfo/next/overview.asp">.NET Framework
1.1</a>
includes support for IPv6. Terendo seems pretty cool (traffic IPv6 over
IPv4 and bypass NAT issues). However, how much does Teredo (sometimes
called Shipworm) rely on UPnP support? The
<a href="http://www.huitema.net/talks/NAT-firewalls-IPv6.ppt">slides</a> Doubt
linked to claims that it works for “all NAT”, but it also discusses UPnP
in depth. I’ve <a href="http://grc.com/unpnp/unpnp.htm">turned off UPnP support</a>
on all my machines inside my Linksys NAT, not because of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-059.asp">security
issue</a>
but because my NAT doesn’t behave when it’s turned on. I have to
routinely reset the NAT when UPnP support is turned on. I’ve updated to
the latest firmware, but I’m still having the problem.</p>
