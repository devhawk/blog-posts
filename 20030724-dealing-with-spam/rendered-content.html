<p>My father just pointed me to the <a href="http://www.mailinator.com">Mailinator</a>
service. Basically, it’s a totally public email system for fake email
address. I guess the primary example is a place where you want to
download something, but you have to give your email address before you
can download. Typically, I just use a fake email address for that. But
for some places, they want to check to make sure the email address is
real first, so they send the download link to the email address. But
they also harvest the email address and sell it. Mailinator solves this.
You give an @mailinator.com address, they send the download link, you
pick it up (no password needed) and the email (and all resulting spam)
gets auto-deleted. Cool.</p>
<p>But their slogan sounds like something my brother would come up with –
“It’s like flicking a booger…at spam”.</p>
