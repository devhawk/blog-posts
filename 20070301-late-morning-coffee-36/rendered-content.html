<li>It snowed <em>again</em> yesterday. Last year we had one snowstorm, the
year before that none. We’ve now had I think five this year plus the
massive windstorm that knocked out power for days.</li>
<li>Technorati told me that “social news aggregator” Megite is <a href="http://www.megite.com/technology/1170964019/41">linking
to me</a>. For some
reason, <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/07/perusing-powershell-part-2-error-or-no-output/">this post of
mine</a>
on Powershell is considered related to “<a href="http://www.strumpette.com/archives/300-Is-PR-Too-Stupid-for-Conversational-Marketing.html">Is PR Too Stupid for
Conversational
Marketing?</a>”
from <a href="http://www.strumpette.com/">Amanda Chapel</a>. Seems like Megite
has some bugs to work out.</li>

BPEL support for WF but David Chappel
<a href="http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/2007/02/windows-workflow-foundation-and-bpel.html">writes</a>
“no one should interpret the announcement as an embrace of
BPEL-based development by Microsoft”. Personally, I think BPEL is
just the latest attempt at “write once, run anywhere” and will meet
with the same limited success of previous attempts. The last thing I
think MSFT should do is embrace BPEL based development.</li>
<li>BPEL actually has two flavors, Executable and Abstract. Abstract
BPEL is potentially fairly useful. You could use to exchange of the
publicly viewable parts of a process with a partner in order to make
two processes work together. That’s fairly exciting. I would welcome
Abstract BPEL support for WF and/or BTS. But as far as I can tell,
most of the BPEL focus has been around Executable BPEL, which as I
wrote above is attempting to be a platform independent language for
implementing business process. That’s fairly unexciting since we’ve
been down this road before many times (UNIX, CORBA, J2EE) and it has
never worked out.</li>

the launch of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/">Beginner Developer Learning
Center</a>. It
includes <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/kids/">Kid’s
Corner</a> with
the cutely named <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/kids/csharp">C# for Sharp
Kids</a>
and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/kids/vb">VB for Very Bright
Kids</a> e-books.
Very cool, I can’t wait to share this with my kids in a few years.
Only complaint: where’s the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/xna/">XNA</a>
love?</li>
