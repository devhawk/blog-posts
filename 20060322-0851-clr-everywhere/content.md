Big news from the Game Developers Conference this week is the XNA
Framework. From the [press
release](http://www.microsoft.com/XNA/3.20.2006.aspx):

> The XNA Framework contains a custom implementation of the Microsoft®
> .NET Framework and new game-development-specific libraries designed to
> help game developers more easily create cross-platform games on
> Windows® and Xbox 360 using the highly productive C\# programming
> language. Using the XNA Framework, game developers will benefit from
> the ability to re-use code and game assets in developing multiplatform
> titles, without sacrificing performance or flexibility.

So now I can the Xbox to the list of personal technology I can program,
joining my
[phone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/programming/netcf/default.aspx),
my [TV](http://msdn.microsoft.com/mce), my [server](http://asp.net) and
my [laptop](http://msdn.microsoft.com/winfx/) all with C\# or VB ([VB
plug](http://weblogs.asp.net/brianbec/archive/2005/09/02/424335.aspx)
brought to you by
[Brian](http://weblogs.asp.net/brianbec/archive/2005/09/02/424335.aspx) and
[Erik](http://research.microsoft.com/~emeijer/) who think I should to
switch). I wonder if XNA Framework will support WPF?

BTW, I still want an easy way to program my house and my car, but I’m
sure those are coming.

Where else should the CLR live?
