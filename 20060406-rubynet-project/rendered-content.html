<p>Having written about Ruby in the scope of the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/15/compiler-dev-lab-scripting/">Compiler Dev
Lab</a> and
the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/28/the-dual-schema-problem/">Dual Schema
Problem</a>, I
was interested to come across the <a href="http://www.plas.fit.qut.edu.au/rubynet/">Ruby.NET
project</a> from <a href="http://www.fit.qut.edu.au/">Queensland
University of Technology</a>. From the Ruby.NET
home page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is to create a compiler for the Ruby language that targets
the .NET CLR. We aim to support 100% of Ruby language semantics,
including all dynamic constructs such as closures and continuations.
We plan to generate 100% managed and verifiable CIL code.</p>

<p>Sweet!</p>
