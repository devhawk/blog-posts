<p>It’s a slow Thursday.</p>
<ul>
<li>BPEL 2.0 <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/news/oasis-news-2007-04-12.php">has been
approved</a>
as an OASIS standard. John Evdemon from my old team <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2007/04/12/ws-bpel-2-0-approved-as-an-oasis-standard.aspx">has the
details</a>.
As I’ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/01/late-morning-coffee-36/">written
before</a>,
I think the spec is too heavily focused on executable process and
not enough on abstract process. But I guess congrats are in order
none the less.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2 v2</a> is out.
Unfortunately, it still doesn’t support user defined syntax schemes.
I wonder if the switch from GPL to BSD license might encourage
someone to add that support? (via
