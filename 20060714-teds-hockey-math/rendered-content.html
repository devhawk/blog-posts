ðŸ˜„ <a href="http://ted.aol.com/index.php?id=300">Ted
Leonsis</a> does the hockey math on
the <a href="http://www.washingtoncaps.com/news/news.asp?story_id=4117">re-acquisition of Richard
Zednik</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, ifÂ my math is correct, we will have Zubrus on our first line,
Zednik on our second line and Gordon (who will most likely play for
the Caps and Hershey next season) in exchange for Jan Bulis, Trevor
LindenÂ andÂ a second and a third round pick. Â That is a pretty decent
set of deals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, Tedâ€™s math isnâ€™t quite right. We got Linden as a part of the
original Zednik trade, then traded him for the 1st round pick we used on
Gordon. And of course, we started with Zednik, so thatâ€™s a wash. So the
actual math goes
<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?statsId=1485">Zubrus</a> and
<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?statsId=3170">Gordon</a> for
<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?statsId=1648">Bulis</a>, a
2nd round pick (not sure who the Canucks got with that pick) and a 3rd
round pick in next years draft. On paper, Bulis and Zubrus are close to
a wash â€“ Bulis had 20 goals and 40 points last season, Zubrus has 23
goals and 57 points. So that breaks the trade down to a 1st round pick
(i.e. Gordon) for a 2nd and a 3rd. Not bad, but not mind blowing either.</p>
<p>That being said, itâ€™s nice to have Zed Head back in a Caps jersey.
Hockey is played on ice, not paper. Iâ€™d rather have Zubrus and Zednick
than Bulis and Linden any day.</p>
