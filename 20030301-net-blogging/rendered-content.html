<p>I’ve been blogging with <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/01/15/webloging-from-front-page/">Front Page as my front
end</a>, but it
looks like I’m going to have to investigate
<a href="http://gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/spoutletex.aspx?key=2003-02-28T07:38:50Z">InfoPath</a>.
As .NET blogging tools grow up, I might need to move my site onto
<a href="http://aspnetweblog.com/">ASPNetWeblog</a> or
<a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">BlogX</a>. I wonder how well these tools
support customization. I’ve obviously got more than just blog up on this
site.</p>
