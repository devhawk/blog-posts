I’ve been blogging with [Front Page as my front
end](http://devhawk.net/2003/01/15/webloging-from-front-page/), but it
looks like I’m going to have to investigate
[InfoPath](http://gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/spoutletex.aspx?key=2003-02-28T07:38:50Z).
As .NET blogging tools grow up, I might need to move my site onto
[ASPNetWeblog](http://aspnetweblog.com/) or
[BlogX](http://www.simplegeek.com/). I wonder how well these tools
support customization. I’ve obviously got more than just blog up on this
site.
