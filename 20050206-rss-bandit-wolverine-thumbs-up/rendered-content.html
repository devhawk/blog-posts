<p>Even though Iâ€™m a happy <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a> customer,
I decided to try out the new <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=443134">beta
version</a> of <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSS
Bandit</a>. Wow, I really like the newspaper
view. I wish I had this in Outlook.</p>
<p>I recently hopped on the <a href="http://www.gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD</a>
bandwagon and among other changes I deleted all my mail rules and
started over. Previously, I was routing my email to different folders
based on if I was on the To: line, the CC: line, it came to one of the
team aliases or none of the above. I discovered that I pretty much only
keep good track of my main inbox with the stuff that came directly to
me. Other stuff just languished, unprocessed. Now, I route mail to
folders based on the mailing list it comes from. Some mailing lists have
lower priority than others. This newspaper view would be perfect for
quickly scanning these low priority mail folders, esp. with the feature
to mark all as read when leaving the folder.</p>
