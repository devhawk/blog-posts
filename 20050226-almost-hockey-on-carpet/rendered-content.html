<p>I watched the <a href="http://nll.com/">National Lacrosse League</a> All-Star Game
this afternoon. It’s not hockey, but I enjoyed it quite a bit –
especially at the end. They had the league commissioner on at halftime
talking about expansion. If they had a team in Seattle, I’d go.</p>
<p>One of the things I liked about Lacrosse is that the players all have to
have day jobs. Average NLL salary is apparently around $12,000.
Apparently, many of the player’s teach for their “day jobs” which
impressed <a href="http://techiewife.com">my wife</a> immensely. She mentioned that
this is how all sports leagues should be. I couldn’t agree more.</p>
<p>When I lived in LA, I used to play hockey in the amateur league. I
haven’t played since I moved up due to a variety of reasons – including
cost and distance to rink. But there’s an <a href="http://arenasports.net/index.php?action=arena_locations">indoor
facility</a> where
they play lacrosse in Redmond, less than four miles from campus. They
also play inline hockey and indoor soccer too.</p>
