For those who *don’t* keep a close eye on my Xbox playing habits, I picked
up [NHL 07](http://www.xbox.com/nhl07xbox360) last night. There are two
hockey franchises for the Xbox 360: [EA
Sports](http://www.easports.com/) and [2K
Sports](http://www.2ksports.com/). I’ve been a 2K fan for several years,
but I didn’t think much of their [last
effort](http://www.xbox.com/games/nhl2k6xbox/) on Xbox so I never
bothered to pick the 360 version. Of course, EA Sports skipped the 360
last year so I’ve been without next-gen hockey since I bought my
next-gen console.

Now there’s a new version of both major hockey franchises, just in time
for the [opening of training
camps](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?page=2006camps). Each
has had an entire year to innovate, and it’s interesting to see where
each title has spent that time. 2K Sports has created “Cinemotion”,
which is an entirely new presentation system which is more like an
“[interactive hockey
movie](http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/732/732345p1.html)” than a TV
broadcast.

EA Sports spent their time on an entirely new control scheme called “Skill
Stick”. Basically, while the left thumbstick still controls player
movement, the right thumbstick controls the player’s stick. It’s taking
time to get used to – hey I’ve only had the game a few hours – but so
far I really like it. I was playing the [XBLM
Demo](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/marketplace/nhl07/demo.htm) and
scored on a sweet spinorama move with the skill stick. That pretty much
hooked me on the spot. Most of the
[reviewers](http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/nhl07#critics)
have singled out the skill stick as the reason for the
generally favorable reviews. 

Plus, EA picked [Washington Capitals](http://www.washingtoncaps.com/) superstar 
[Alex Ovechkin](http://www.washingtoncaps.com/team/player.asp?player_id=17) for
their cover athlete. Barring awful reviews, I pretty much decided to
pickup NHL 07 as soon as I heard that.
