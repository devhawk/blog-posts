<p>News was expecting inches, but we only got a dusting of snow last night.</p>
<ul>
<li>We had dinner last night with my old friend
<a href="http://technovangelist.com">Matt</a>, who <a href="http://technovangelist.com/archive/2005/08/11/14.aspx">moved to
Amsterdam</a> a
year and a half ago and is getting to <a href="http://technovangelist.com/archive/2006/10/30/Visited-Countries-Getting-Redder.aspx">travel the
world</a>.
Kids didn’t have a nap yesterday, so they weren’t quite on their
best behavior, but it was great to see Matt. Hopefully it won’t be
another 18 months before we see him again.</li>
<li>For the second time in four months, the power cable for my laptop
failed. I wonder if there is something wrong with the power supply
that’s causing the cable to fail? At least this time I wasn’t <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/09/20/hard-on-hardware/">in
Canada</a>.</li>
<li>There’s a <a href="http://www.xbox.com/NR/rdonlyres/BF491CFF-8B54-4314-9553-FD16F8F8E7B5/0/vidIPTV_InterviewHi.asx">high resolution
video</a>
of the Xbox 360 IPTV up on <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/ces2007">Xbox.com’s CES
page</a>. They make
it <em>very</em> clear this is “something you need to get from your service
provider”. Telling quote: “It’s kinda like what I have today, but
better”. Doesn’t seem that much better, so far anyway.</li>
<li>I’m knee deep in WCF security code again. Mucking about with X.509
certificates sucks. I tried to follow these
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733813.aspx">directions</a>
to create a dev root CA certificate as well as dev certs signed by
said dev root CA, but I get security negotiation errors because the
system can’t check to see if the cert has been revoked. I guess I’ll
just install <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376539.aspx">Certificate
Services</a>
instead</li>
<li>My nominee for best new acronym:
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=790">JBOWS</a> (Just a
Bunch of Web Services), apparently coined by <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented">Joe
McKendrick</a>. Web services,
to date at least, seem like they’re being used primarily for
building distributed applications, rather than a loosely coupled
services. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, unless you’re
fooling yourself (or those holding the purse strings) that you’ll
get integration “automagically” or “for free” just because you’re
using web services. Joe McKendrick is definitely not an
<a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!271.entry">SOA-hole</a>.</li>
<li>The next new language I learn will be
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">F#</a>. Just not
sure when or how.</li>
</ul>
