<li>In writers strike news, the WGA has made side deals with <a href="http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/letterman-story-upcoming/">Worldwide
Pants</a>
(aka Dave Letterman’s company), <a href="http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/wga-ua-side-deal-officially-unveiled/">United
Artists</a>
(aka Tom Cruise’s company) and <a href="http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/heroic-harvey-hardly/">The Weinstein
Company</a>
(<del>previously known as Miramax</del>). The WGA strategy of divide and
conquer seems to me making slow progress. <strong>Update</strong>: The Weinstein
Company was founded by Miramax’s founders Harvey and Bob Weinstein
after they left Miramax. But Miramax is still around. Thanks to
GrantC for the correction.</li>
<li>They’re still two games under .500, but the Caps completed a season
sweep of the Eastern Conference leading Ottawa Senators last night.
They’re only 3 games out of the top spot in the (admittedly very
weak) Southeast division</li>
<li>Big tech news today isn’t coming from MSFT-land. <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/winds_of_change_are_blowing">Sun is buying
MySQL</a>
and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120048691486294361.html">Oracle is (finally) buying
BEA</a>. Both
deals seem like pretty significant culture clashes, though Sun/MySQL
seems like the better fit of the two.</li>
<li>There’s a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-sml-20080114/">new draft</a> of
Service Modeling Language 1.1 available. If you’ll recall, this used
to be called the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/business/dsi/sdmwp.mspx">System Definition
Model</a>, part of
the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/business/dsi/default.mspx">Dynamic Systems
Initiative</a>.
Hadn’t heard anything from those folks in a while, good to see
they’re making progress.</li>
<li>Stephan Tolksdorf dropped me a line to tell me he was able to
“vastly simplify” <a href="http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/">FParsec</a>, and
as a result it now runs on the current version of F#. Awesome!</li>
<li>Speaking of F#, Scott Hanselman has a new <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesPodcast96StartingSmallWithFWithDustinCampbell.aspx">F#
podcast</a>,
this time interviewing <a href="http://diditwith.net/">Dustin Campbell</a>.
Check out all of Dustin’s <a href="http://diditwith.net/CategoryView,category,F%23.aspx">F#
posts</a>.</li>
<li>I didn’t know about the <a href="http://blog.spontaneouspublicity.com/2007/12/10/productivity-tip-copy-as-path/">“Copy as Path”
feature</a>
in Vista. Why is it hidden?</li>
<li>I was a big fan of the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/choose/windowsdesktopsearch.mspx">WDS</a>
deskbar shortcut feature – a feature that is missing in Vista. Enter
<a href="http://brandontools.com/content/StartPlusPlus.aspx%20">Start++</a> by
<a href="http://brandonlive.com/">Brandon Paddock</a>, which adds shortcuts to
Vista’s search box. It also supports “<a href="http://brandonlive.com/2007/08/18/iphone-apps-in-your-start-menu/">iPhone
apps</a>”
and
<a href="http://brandonlive.com/2007/05/19/start-upcoming-feature-scripting/">scripting</a>.
But JScript? Where’s the PowerShell love, Brandon?</li>
<li>EA released the <a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/home/micropolis/">source code to the original
SimCity</a> under the GPL.
Bil Simser is <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/2008/01/14/building-a-city-the-series.aspx">digging into the
code</a>
and it looks like he’s going to port it to XNA. (via
<a href="http://ozymandias.com/archive/2008/01/14/simcity-sourcecode-released-under-gnu-gpl.aspx">Ozymandias</a>)</li>
<li>Wes Haggard has <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/whaggard/archive/2008/01/14/added-codehtmler-project-at-codeplex.aspx">published the source
code</a>
to <a href="http://codeplex.com/CodeHtmer">CodeHTMLer on CodePlex</a>. He took
two updates from me: the F# language definition as well as the
ability to choose the font when not using PRE tags.</li>
