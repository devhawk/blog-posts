I just got back from the Weblogger’s BOF, which had impromptu meetings
going on for an hour past the scheduled end time. Lots of great
discussion, not a lot of agreement. There seem to be several threads of
discussion. I spent a bunch of time with [Peter
Provost](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/) & [Chris
Hollander](http://objective.mine.nu/index.aspx) afterwards talking about
how to scale a news aggregator to handle thousands of weblogs.
[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) reads over 600 and I don’t
know how he keeps up with it. I did have to convince Peter that weblog
discovery is not the issue – if something gets posted in blogsphere of
value, chances are someone you read will link to it. That’s the nature
of a highly interconnected network like blogsphere.

To top it off, I got to spend a while chatting with [Peter
Drayton](http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog/), who seems
[poised](http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog/2003/10/27.html#a387) to return
to blogging after a nine month absence. We chatted about Rotor, the CLR
team, REST, ATOM and a replacement for Radio (dasBlog, of course). I
think I’m going to need to spend a week on campus pinballing between
offices once I get back from PDC.
