<li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/unity">Unity’s</a> first CTP was just over two
weeks ago, but <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/02/27/entlib-unity-roadmap.aspx">according to Grigori
Melnik</a>,
it’s shipping just over two weeks from now. That seems pretty speedy
to me. By the time I get a change to take a closer look at Unity,
it’ll probably have shipped.</li>
<li>I discovered <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/default.aspx">Matthew
Podwysocki</a> blog
<a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/patterns/IoC_and_the_Unity_Application_Block_Once_Again">via

I don’t typically subscribe to blogs that I discover via DNK, but
Matthew has written about

and

<li>Corporate VP David Treadwell has an <a href="http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2008/02/27/213.aspx">extensive
post</a>
on updates to the Windows Live Platform Services that are being
unveiled at MIX next week. The updates include the new <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc298458.aspx">WL Messenger
Library</a>, a
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc287637.aspx">new SDK</a>
for <a href="http://winliveid.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!AEE1BB0D86E23AAC!1460.entry">WL ID Delegated
Authentication</a>,
a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb932323.aspx">new WL Photo
API</a>, a new
CTP of <a href="http://dev.live.com/tools/">WL Tools</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astoriateam/archive/2008/02/13/atompub-support-in-the-ado-net-data-services-framework.aspx">standardized support
for
AtomPub</a>,
updates to <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb463989.aspx">WL Contacts
API</a> and
<a href="http://silverlight.live.com/">Sivlerlight Streaming</a> and a new
“experimental” service called Application Based Storage that “allows
application developers to store a small amount of
state/configuration data in the WL data centers on behalf of a
user”. I’m sure there’ll be more WL news at the MIX conference
proper, but that’s quite a good chunk of features to start digging
into. Personally, I’m particularly interested in WL Delegated Auth,
esp. how it deals with phishing, something <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/11/19/morning-coffee-124/">I don’t think OAuth
handles very
well</a>.</li>
<li>Windows Live isn’t the only group making announcements in advance of
MIX. Adobe <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/26/adobe-player_1.html">announced a research
project</a>
that allows “cross-compiling existing code from C, C++, Java,
Python, and Ruby to ActionScript.” This seems pretty obviously a
response to Silverlight 2.0′s embedded CLR, announced last year @
MIX. Support for C++ is very interesting – Adobe evangelist Ted
Patrick
<a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/2008/02/extending-adobe-flash-player-and-adobe.php">claims</a>
they were even able to cross-compile Quake 1 to Flash. Interesting,
but this is an internal research project @ Adobe with no projected
release date while Silverlight 2.0 goes <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/22/first-look-at-silverlight-2.aspx">into beta next
week</a>.</li>
