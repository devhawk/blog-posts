As you might expect, these morning coffee posts are going to get more
dev focused as well as more IPy focused.

-   One of the cool things we showed @ PyCon was
    [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) running on the [latest drop
    of
    IronPython](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=10266).
    IPy lead developer Dino Viehand [posted a blog
    entry](http://blogs.msdn.com/dinoviehland/archive/2008/03/17/ironpython-ms-sql-and-pep-249.aspx)
    (for the first time in 28 months!) showing the basic Python DB
    provider for SQL Server he put together. Hopefully, we won’t have to
    wait another two and a half years for Dino’s next post.
-   Speaking of IronPython, some of my new teammates pointed me to
    [Michael
    Foord’s](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/voidspace/index.shtml)
    [Planet IronPython aggregate news
    site](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/planet/). Michael is
    IPy developer for [Resolver
    Systems](http://www.resolversystems.com/) (the cool spreadsheet app
    hybrid [I wrote about @
    Lang.NET](http://devhawk.net/2008/01/31/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx))
    and he’s working on an [IPy book](http://www.manning.com/foord).
-   Still speaking of IPy, Jeff Hardy [dropped his first
    release](http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2008-March/006649.html)
    of [NWSGI](http://www.codeplex.com/NWSGI), an port of [Python’s Web
    Service Gateway Interface](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/)
    spec to ASP.NET and IPy. I can’t wait to see NWSGI combined Django
    running on IPy like [Dino demoed @
    PyCon](http://unbracketed.org/2008/mar/16/pycon-2008-django-now-plays-dark-side/).
    Congrats Jeff!
-   Scott Hanselman’s [post on
    Twitter](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TwitterTheUselessfulnessOfMicroblogging.aspx)
    reminds me that I recently started [twittering
    myself](http://twitter.com/devhawk). I haven’t worked it into my
    daily routine, so it gets updated only occasionally, but after
    reading Scott’s post, I’m thinking it’s cooler than it appears on
    the surface. 
-   In surprising news, Microsoft [is going to start
    collaborating](http://port25.technet.com/archive/2008/03/19/supernova.aspx)
    with IBM’s Eclipse Foundation, to make it easier to it easier to
    write apps for Windows in Java. I would think this is a very cool
    thing, but apparently Ted Neward – who’s knowledge of JavaWorld far
    eclipses (ha ha) my own –
    [thinks](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/03/20/Eclipse+Gets+Some+Help+Building+Windows+Apps+From+Microsoft.aspx)
    “the skin here is just too sensitive” and that this move might cause
    more controversy between MS and Java. However, he seems to imply the
    controversy would be between MS & Sun (Eclipse is obviously named as
    a jab @ Sun) rather than between MS & the Java community.
