<p>As you might expect, these morning coffee posts are going to get more
dev focused as well as more IPy focused.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the cool things we showed @ PyCon was
<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> running on the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=10266">latest drop
of
IronPython</a>.
IPy lead developer Dino Viehand <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dinoviehland/archive/2008/03/17/ironpython-ms-sql-and-pep-249.aspx">posted a blog
entry</a>
(for the first time in 28 months!) showing the basic Python DB
provider for SQL Server he put together. Hopefully, we won’t have to
wait another two and a half years for Dino’s next post.</li>
<li>Speaking of IronPython, some of my new teammates pointed me to
<a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/voidspace/index.shtml">Michael
Foord’s</a>
<a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/planet/">Planet IronPython aggregate news
site</a>. Michael is
IPy developer for <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/">Resolver
Systems</a> (the cool spreadsheet app
hybrid <a href="http://www.devhawk.net/2008/01/31/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx">I wrote about @
Lang.NET</a>)
and he’s working on an <a href="http://www.manning.com/foord">IPy book</a>.</li>
<li>Still speaking of IPy, Jeff Hardy <a href="http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2008-March/006649.html">dropped his first
release</a>
of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/NWSGI">NWSGI</a>, an port of <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">Python’s Web
Service Gateway Interface</a>
spec to ASP.NET and IPy. I can’t wait to see NWSGI combined Django
running on IPy like <a href="http://unbracketed.org/2008/mar/16/pycon-2008-django-now-plays-dark-side/">Dino demoed @
PyCon</a>.
Congrats Jeff!</li>
<li>Scott Hanselman’s <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TwitterTheUselessfulnessOfMicroblogging.aspx">post on
Twitter</a>
reminds me that I recently started <a href="http://twitter.com/devhawk">twittering
myself</a>. I haven’t worked it into my
daily routine, so it gets updated only occasionally, but after
reading Scott’s post, I’m thinking it’s cooler than it appears on
the surface. </li>
<li>In surprising news, Microsoft <a href="http://port25.technet.com/archive/2008/03/19/supernova.aspx">is going to start
collaborating</a>
with IBM’s Eclipse Foundation, to make it easier to it easier to
write apps for Windows in Java. I would think this is a very cool
thing, but apparently Ted Neward – who’s knowledge of JavaWorld far
eclipses (ha ha) my own –
<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/03/20/Eclipse+Gets+Some+Help+Building+Windows+Apps+From+Microsoft.aspx">thinks</a>
“the skin here is just too sensitive” and that this move might cause
more controversy between MS and Java. However, he seems to imply the
controversy would be between MS &amp; Sun (Eclipse is obviously named as
a jab @ Sun) rather than between MS &amp; the Java community.</li>
</ul>
