<p>I’ve updated my <a href="prj_sharepointsynd.aspx">SharePoint RSS Feed Generator</a>
to version 0.2. Primary new feature: RSS feeds for individual lists. As
I mentioned in my last post, I’m on vacation next week, so v0.3 will be
a while. Current top features being considered for v0.3 are an OPML feed
and modifying the WSS UI to include links to RSS feeds (both web feeds
and list feeds).</p>
<p>I’ve also been working on a tool to help me explore the Windows
SharePoint database. Any interest in that?</p>
