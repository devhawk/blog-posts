<p>Wow, am I really that loud?
😄</p>
<p>This is a response to the idea that no design is complete until you
can’t remove anything else without sacrificing the overall goals of
the end result.  Is the pinky really necessary?  We can “cut that
feature”, right?

<p>If you cut off the pinkie, then the ring finger becomes the pinkie and
so iteratively you will have to lose all of them 😃. If I remember
right in Europe, you hold up the pinkie to order beer. So it’s quite
important
😄</p>

<p>Well I find it hard to argue with ordering beer, but I doubt the
pinkie’s original use was to order beer.  Therefore I’d describe this
as an abuse of an existing API that might be better served by a new
API specifically designed for this purpose.  But I question even if a
new API is necessary. </p>
<p>Drinking beer by definition involves a container in which the beer is
consumed from.  Therefore the container it’s self (or the lack
thereof) might be able to serve the dual role for both consuming the
beer and indicating the need for a refill.  For example when drinking
sake I’ve been told it is customary to tip the bottle on its side to
indicate the desire for a refill.  Are we really to expect that the
Human API exposes every need in a direct fashion?  For example should
I have another appendage for “I need more bread sticks” and yet
another for “Can I get a refill or on the water?”.  I’d propose the “2
creams no sugar” appendage because that’s the way I take my coffee.</p>
<p>On the other hand the iterative problem does seem to be more relevant
– but it presupposes a purpose for the pinky in the first place!  But
alas, I admit I’ve just returned from drinking beer, so this may not
be the best argument 😃.</p>

<p>The pinkie is like a reserved field/custom field in a API. Every user
community can come up with its own use for it but they have to devise
the protocol themselves. Apparently different civilizations have.
Wikipedia as usual has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_finger#Cultural_significance">list of
those</a>.
So do you get your “2 creams no sugar” appendage – sure if u can agree
on the semantics with the waiter. Seems like a PM call to me
😄</p>
<p>PS: What beer did u have? I should try that – seems effective
😄</p>

<p>I hadn’t quite considered it like this but I’d propose an alternate
encoding – binary.  With 4 fingers one can communicate up to 16
different which seems to cover most of the listed issues.  Yes 5 gives
you up to 32 messages but 16 should be enough for everyone 😃.</p>
<p>And they were various Hale’s Ales fresh from the brewery.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t want to hold up 0010 really (although it won’t be the
middle finger anymore)
😄</p>

<p>Ahh, but let’s just call that one reserved – that leaves the end-user
with 15 other messages!  Personally I’d suggest we reserve the entire
bit – that way we could use other codes like 1010 for future expansion
of various standard messages.  Urination seems popular on the pinky
list so maybe we’d want to standardize that in the future – we of
course need to look at uses of the other fingers before we come to
this conclusion.  Users are now left with 8 user-defined messages but
that seems plenty.  Also they can then use 1000 or 0001 (depending
their endianness, a.k.a. left-handed or right-handed) for the now
deprecated pinky-messages.</p>

<p>1000, 1100, 1110 and 1111 are actually used for counting numbers
1,2,3,4
😄
They are too obvious to be non-standardized. So they are out as well.</p>
<p>That cuts the user messages to 5 (third bit is reserved anyway). Some
of the ones left are hard to make as well – try 0101
😄</p>
