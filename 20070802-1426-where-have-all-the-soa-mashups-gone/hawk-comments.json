    "content": "Those mashups are stuffed into a shoebox along with our web services.  Four years ago, weren't there meant to be *millions* of web services thriving in a new market?

But beyond that, it will be vertical applications that are further automating a specific business chain.  I think you'll find web services have submerged similarly to industry-specific applications.\n",
