I’m supposed to be on vacation, but it doesn’t look like this news has
hit the blogosphere. [Ward
Cunningham](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham), inventor of the Wiki
and general pattern wonk, has joined Microsoft. He’s got a [wiki
page](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TipsForWardAtMicrosoft) up for tips. I got
to meet him on Tuesday and promised not to blog his arrival until he
posted it on his site. Welcome Ward! I’ll be doing some very cool things
with him, but more on that later. In the meantime, check out [Testing
Software
Patterns](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/Tsp/default.aspx)
on the [MSDN Architecture
Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx).

Speaking of wikis, the source code [FlexWiki](http://www.flexwiki.com),
another .NET based wiki, is available online. I need to dig thru
FlexWiki to see if having [DevHawk
Wiki](http://www.devhawk.net/prj_wiki.aspx) around anymore makes any
sense.
