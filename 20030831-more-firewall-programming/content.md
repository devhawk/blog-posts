BTW, if anyone is looking, you can code programmatically control the
IPv4 firewall via the [ICS/ICF
API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/ics/ics/ics_and_icf_start_page.asp).
And the docs for the IPv6 firewall SDK are
[online](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/ipv6icf/ics/ipv6_icf_start_page.asp).
