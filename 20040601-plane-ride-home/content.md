BTW, I ended up watching the three episodes of [Penn & Teller:
Bullshit!](http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/home.do) on the flight home from
Tech·Ed. I made this a seperate post since I wasn’t sure how much the
MSDN folks would appreciate the “foul” lanugage on [Architecture
Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/). Amazon [spells
it](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00019PDNY/104-7563528-7076700)
“Bullsh\*t” but I don’t get the whole changing one letter thing. I mean,
if you’re offended by the word “Bullshit”, are your really going to be
placated by a fucking asterisk?
:smile:
