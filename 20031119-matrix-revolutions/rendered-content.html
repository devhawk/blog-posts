<p>I finally got to see <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rv_img/revolutions_teaser.jpg">The Matrix
Revolutions</a>.
My whole division saw it on opening day, but since that was during
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/11/04/saf-day-one/">SAF</a>, our
team couldn’t go. So we went en masse on Monday. I guess I’m in the
minority, both in blogsphere and on the team, but I really enjoyed it. I
also just finished playing <a href="http://www.enterthematrixgame.com">Enter The
Matrix</a>. Funny coincidence, I reached
the point of the game that corresponds to the end of <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_img/poster_intnl_smith.jpg">The Matrix
Reloaded</a>
on Sunday, saw Revolutions Monday, finished the game Tuesday. The game
got somewhat decent ratings, but again I liked it. Probably because I
was more interested in it as an adjunct to the movies than as a game.
One review I read complained about the amount of action that took place
during cinematic cut-scenes rather than in the game itself. But since I
played the game primarily for the story, I didn’t mind.</p>
