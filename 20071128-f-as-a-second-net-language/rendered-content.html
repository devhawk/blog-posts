<p><em>(Harry is @ DevTeach in Vancounver with his family this week. He was
hoping to still do Morning Coffee posts, but that’s turned out to be
infeasible. So instead, you get a series of pre-written posts about
F#.)</em></p>
<p>I’ve been spending some real quality time with F# of late. I’ve been
getting into parsing again, and it turns out that functional pattern
matching languages like F# are really good at text processing. After
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/10/morning-coffee-7/">claiming</a> I’d
learn F# this year, then <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/06/morning-coffee-25/">abandoning the
effort</a> to learn
Powershell, I went back to F#. Nothing against PowerShell – I’ve moved
over to using it as my primary command line shell and have tricked out
my startup script and everything. But I haven’t found much need to code
in it lately.</p>
<p>If you’re a .NET ninja guru, you owe it to yourself to take a long look
at F#, if for no other reason to expand your mind. It takes a while to
get used to. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/">Don Syme</a> (aka father of
F#) can attest I’ve been peppering him with questions (Thanks, Don!).
I’ve also been writing code in C# and F#, and looking at the result in
Reflector so I can understand what’s happening. I certainly am not an
F# expert by any stretch, but I do think I’m getting the hang of it.</p>
<p>Since I’ve reached this first plateau of getting it, I thought I’d write
out some of the things I like and don’t like about the language. This is
by no means an introduction to F#. I’d recommend <a href="http://www.strangelights.com/">Robert
Pickering’s</a><a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1590597575">Foundations of
F#</a> book as well as Don’s
<a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1590598504">Expert F# book</a> (when it
comes out). You should also be reading <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lukeh">Luke
Hoban</a>‘s and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jomo_fisher/">Jomo
Fisher</a>‘s blogs – they both just
joined the F# team. C# MVP Tomas Petricek has written several blog
posts introducing F#, which he’s brought together in a <a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/tomasp/archive/2007/11/03/fsharp_introduction.aspx">single
post</a>.
For an general overview of functional programming (the primary
programming paradigm of F#), check out Slava Akhmechet’s <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html">Functional
Programming For The Rest of
Us</a>.</p>
<p>This turned into a fairly long post, so I split it out into a series
that I’ll post thru the end of the week.</p>
