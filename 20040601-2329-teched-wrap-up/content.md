It’s been days, but I’m finally getting around to posting my Tech·Ed wrap-up. I had a great
time as a speaker, track owner and attendee. My Data in SOA talk ended
up with an 8.0 score and our track overall scored a 7.5. Not bad for our
first time out!

My boss’s immediate reaction was to raise the bar for Tech·Ed 2005, which is fine by me as
I have got some specific plans for an even better Architecture track
next year. I learned a lot swimming in the deep end of the pool, such
as:

-   We could have been much better integrated with the other tracks,
    esp. the Dev track. Being involved in the planning from the start
    (Tech·Ed 05 content
    planning starts in earnest in the fall) should help out a bunch
    here, as will knowing the other track owners from this year’s
    event.
-   We could have managed our track better. But hey, it was my first
    time! Things like speaker meetings, more content reviews and
    ensuring speakers go to training all help out here. Also, I’d like a
    little less churn on the management side next year. I took over
    co-track ownership duties when one of my teammates moved onto
    another team.
-   I mentioned that several people commented that there should be “more
    code” in the track. Techie types like sessions that are heavy on the
    hands-on practical and code is about as hands-on practical as it
    gets. However, while I am [on
    record](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/newsletter/default.aspx#Community)
    as being an architect with a lower case “a”, I don’t think
    architects are just senior developers. It’s a different skill – one
    that I want to see broad knowledge of, but still different.
    Architects work primarily in models, patterns and process, not code.
    So for the Architecture track next year, I want to see “more models,
    patterns and process”, not “more code”. Watch for a focus on [VS2005
    Team System for
    Architects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/architect/default.aspx),
    Whitehorse and
    [MSF](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vsts-msf.asp).

What do you think should be in next year’s Architecture Track?
