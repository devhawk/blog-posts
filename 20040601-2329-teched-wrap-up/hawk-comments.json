    "content": "****\n I don't think architects are just senior developers. It's a different skill - one that I want to see broad knowledge of, but still different. Architects work primarily in models, patterns and process, not code.\n****\nI think this is correct, but it implies several different sub-tracks (security has the same issues)\n\n1) How should I as an architect think.  I think the cabana discussions diid a great job on this\n2) So, I've built a lot of monolithic apps, nw how should I really think about systems.  In many ways, this was the focus of the Metropolis series\n3) I'm a code jockey and I want to stay one.  How do I recognize architecture isses - and come to aknowlege when I need to pull the chord and stop the train until architecture is dealt with.  This might be symptoms of an un-architected solution, you know you need an architecture if, . . .\n4) Liberal education in what is architecture, what is program design, and how do you tell the difference.  A good principal is it is better to have an architecture and do simple(r) things than to require virtuoso code that does the impossible.\n\nEach of these might have high or low level tracks, but none is about a lot of code."
