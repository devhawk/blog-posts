My real name is Harry Pierson, but I've gone by "DevHawk" online since I [started this blog back in 2003](~/blog/new-and-improved-devhawk). My blog originally ran on an engine of my own design, then [DasBlog](https://github.com/shanselman/dasblog), then [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). However, I missed having my own sandbox on the web, so I built a new engine called Hawk (natch) to power the blog. It's written in C#, uses [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/home), runs on [Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/) and the source is [up on GitHub](https://github.com/devhawk/Hawk).

I'm known best for my involvement in the Microsoft development community. I was with with Microsoft from October 1998 until June of 2019 - over 20 years! In that time, I had a wide variety of different jobs. I started in Microsoft Consulting before moving into a technical evangelism role. I spent a short time as an architect for Microsoft's internal IT department. When I finally joined the product groups, I started as the program manager for [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/) before spending most of the [second half of my MSFT career](~/blog/joining-windows) as part of the Windows team. 

I spent the Windows 8 and 8.1 product cycles as a program manager on the team that built [Windows Runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Runtime). After four years as a PM, I got tired of writing specs so I [switched to a developer role](~/blog/putting-the-dev-back-in-devhawk). I spent most of 2014 with the [Midori research project](http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/03/blogging-about-midori/) working on [C# for Systems](http://joeduffyblog.com/2013/12/27/csharp-for-systems-programming/). In 2015, I rejoined joined the core Windows team, working on the cross-platform plumbing that powers [SmartGlass](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/smartglass) which eventually evolved into [Project Rome](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/project-rome). After that, I helped form the [xlang](https://github.com/Microsoft/xlang) team, with the goal of bringing Windows Runtime's language projection technology cross platform.

As of June 2019, I'm officially a Microsoft Alumni. I traded in my blue badge to [join the new Seattle office of NEO Global Development](http://devhawk.net/blog/2019/6/2/my-next-adventure).

I always say that the only way to build great products is to talk to the people who use it. So feel free to contact me - [email](mailto:devhawk@outlook.com) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/devhawk) are usually the best ways.
