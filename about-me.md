My real name is Harry Pierson, but I've gone by "DevHawk" online since I [started this blog back in 2003](~/blog/new-and-improved-devhawk).
My blog originally ran on an engine of my own design, then [DasBlog](https://github.com/shanselman/dasblog), then [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). 
However, I missed having my own sandbox on the web, so I built a new engine called Hawk (natch) to power the blog. 
It's written in C#, uses [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/home), runs on [Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/) and the source is [up on GitHub](https://github.com/devhawk/Hawk).

I'm known best for my involvement in the Microsoft development community. 
I've been with Microsoft since October 1998 - over 18 years! 
In that time, I've had a wide variety of different jobs: consulting, pre-sales technical sales, architect evangelism, architect for Microsoft's internal IT department and program manager for [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/).
[Since late 2009](~/blog/joining-windows), I've been a part of the Windows team. 
I spent the Windows 8 and 8.1 product cycles as a program manager on the team that built [Windows Runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Runtime). 
After four years as a PM, I got tired of writing specs so I [switched to a developer role](~/blog/putting-the-dev-back-in-devhawk).
I spent most of 2014 with the [Midori research project](http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/03/blogging-about-midori/) working on [C# for Systems](http://joeduffyblog.com/2013/12/27/csharp-for-systems-programming/).
In 2015, I rejoined joined the core Windows team, working on the cross-platform plumbing that powers [SmartGlass](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/smartglass).
I spent the early part of 2016 on loan to the [Desktop Bridge team (aka Project "Centennial")](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-prepare). 
These days, I spend most of my time on the [platform plumbing for Share](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-to-app/share-data). 
I've also been tangentally involved with the [C++/WinRT project](https://github.com/Microsoft/cppwinrt).

I always say that the only way to build great products is to talk to the people who use it. So feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:harry@@devhawk.net), [Skype](skype:harrypierson) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/devhawk).
