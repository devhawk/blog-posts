<p>My father, who I’ve written about and who has commented here several
times, finally started <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/">his own blog called Hal
9000</a> . He’s using Google’s new
service, which I guess means there is no RSS feed. I can’t find a link
to any syndication feed on the site. Of course, since it took him a week
to email me the address, maybe he’s looking to duck my criticism?
😄</p>
<p>Seriously, my Dad has been a *HUGE* influence on my career (though he
always thought I switched jobs too often – I say I was just looking for
the right place which I finally found @ MSFT). He’s been around UNIX and
C since the start. From Dad’s <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/2004/05/nag-nag-nag.html">first
post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been around computing for a long time! My first job after getting
my doctorate was at Bell Labs. In the Spring 1971 I installed my first
Unix system – with Ken Thompson help. Because my thesis delt with
compiler theory I was interested in C from the beginning – static
routines was my suggestion.</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve worked on air traffice controls systems, case and
office tools, handwriting recognition algorithms, to name a few. I am
one of the authors of the Systems Engineering CMM.</p>
<p>Currently, I teach OO Programming, and OO Analysis &amp; Design at Johns
Hopkins University (part-time engineering school)</p>
<p>My current interests include Security &amp; Enterprise Architectures for a
large gov’t agency; designing Service Orient Architectures; and
software development tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just yesterday, I ran into a TechEd attendee who worked at Bell Labs
back in the day who recognized my last name. A friend of mine who’s an
architect evangelist for MSFT also recognized my name from his days at
Bell Labs. Sure is a small world.</p>
<p>Dad has also
<a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/2004/05/clemens-vasters-indigoed-lightweight.html">commented</a>
on Clemens lightweight transactions post and <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/2004/05/models.html">discussed
modeling</a>. I can’t
wait to see <em>his</em> reaction to Visual Studio 2005 Architect Edition’s
modeling tools.</p>
<p>I added a link to Hal 9000 in my navigation links section. At this rate,
will I need a family blog roll?</p>
