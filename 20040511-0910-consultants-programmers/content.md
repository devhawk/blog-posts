Not only in my blog back in action, but my gracious host Tom has started
a [blog](http://conpro.net) of his own. Since he hosts DevHawk for me, I
added him to both my blog roll and to my navigation links.

Tom’s [first
post](http://www.conpro.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=815b303e-381b-4af9-a731-aae0c82267de) (and
the theme of his blog in general) is about the role of consultants and
programmers in the future. He draws a nice parallel comparing how those
roles are changing to how the chaufer role changed during the 20th
century.
