I hadn’t realized how cool the Halo 2 stats site on bungie.net is until
Scott [blogged
it](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4deb3ddd-8211-46fc-9cef-f6154785c1fe)
. This really brings the online experience to a new level. It’s so cool,
that I had to create a new flair for my blog linking to [my stats
page](http://www.bungie.net/Stats/PlayerStats.aspx?player=RayTracer) (I
also put up a link to my games [RSS
feed](http://www.bungie.net/stats/halo2rss.ashx?i=58981&k=13126510)).
Granted, my stats so far are pretty lame – I’ve only played one
multiplayer game so far and I came in 5th. (I did spend most of last
night playing the campain.) Maybe the public nature of the stats will
drive me to improve them. I haven’t joined a clan yet, but when I do
I’ll create a flair for that too.

The coolest thing about this is that it sets a new bar for online
experience. [ESPN Video Games](http://leagues.espnvideogames.com/) and
[EA Sports](http://www.easports.com/online/home.jsp) are nowhere near
this level of detail, but I imagine they are taking notice.
