Just got a call from my parents – my father’s copy of [MSDN
Magazine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/03/default.aspx)
with my article just arrived today. (Yes it’s true, I followed in the
“family business” of software development). Mine hasn’t shown up yet nor
is it published online yet, but it’s very cool to know it’s on it’s way.
