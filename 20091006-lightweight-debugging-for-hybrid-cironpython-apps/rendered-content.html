<p>One of the IronPython scenarios that I’m hearing more and more about
recently is for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_%28computing%29">polyglot</a>
programs. In these scenarios, part of the application is built in
IronPython other parts are build in compiled, statically typed languages
like C# or Visual Basic. Sometimes, programs are written this way to
allow the C# app to access a Python library, like my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/04/05/pygments-for-windows-live-writer/">Pygments for WL
Writer</a>
plugin. Other programs want to be customizable by the end user, like
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/intellipad/archive/2008/11/11/newbie-experience-writing-a-custom-command.aspx">Intellipad</a>.
Whatever the reason, I think that the number of these hybrid polyglot
programs is going up, which partially explains why the C# team added
the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264741(VS.100).aspx">new dynamic
type</a> to
C# 4.0.</p>
<p>(FYI: the <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/you_had_me_at_dynamic_shirt-235421109922997983">You had me at

<p>The thing is that if you’re going to build polyglot apps, you’re
probably going to want the ability to debug polyglot apps as well. I’ve
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/02/27/writing-an-ironpython-debugger-introduction/">written
extensively</a>
about building a debugger for IronPython. However,
<a href="http://github.com/devhawk/ipydbg/">ipydbg</a> uses the CLR debugger under
the hood which means you have to have the debugger and the code it’s
debugging in separate processes. That’s a huge design burden for
building a debuggable polyglot application. Luckily, as of IronPython
2.6, we support Python’s built-in trace debugging capability (aka
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.settrace">sys.settrace</a>).
While you can use this in pure Python apps (like
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html">PDB</a>), you can also use it
polyglot C# (or VB)/IronPython apps as well. If only someone were to
take the time to build a sample and document what he did along the way…</p>
<p>Hey, that sounds like PM work!</p>
<p>Seriously, let me introduce you to the worlds simplest Twitter
application: GetThings. The app downloads a list of my tweets via the
Twitter API and displays them in a list box. The UI is written in C#
while the tweet download code is written in Python. Clearly, this is a
pretty brain dead app – but the point isn’t to build a great Twitter app
but rather to show how to use the settrace API from C#.</p>
<p>I’ve stuck the <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/LightweightDebuggerDemo">code up on
GitHub</a>. If you want
to see the basic app in action sans debugging, start with the <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/LightweightDebuggerDemo/commit/92bd5fc330e2a48ae84fc185f3e397aefb4be1eb">initial
checkin</a>.
As you can see here, basic C# / IronPython integration is pretty
trivial. I’m simply creating an engine and a scope, adding the list
boxes’ Items property to the scope, and executing the getthings.py file
from the disk.</p>
<div class="lang-csharp editor-colors"><div style="color:Black;background-color:White;"><pre>
<span style="color:Blue;">private</span> <span style="color:Blue;">void</span> Window_Loaded(<span style="color:Blue;">object</span> sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    ScriptEngine engine = Python.CreateEngine();
    ScriptScope  scope = engine.CreateScope();
    scope.SetVariable(<span style="color:#A31515;">&quot;items&quot;</span>, lbThings.Items);
    engine.ExecuteFile(<span style="color:#A31515;">&quot;getthings.py&quot;</span>, scope);
}

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Since GetThings.py is just a text file, the user can modify it to get a
list of anything they want – some other user’s timeline, the public
timeline, or even – gasp! – something not from Twitter! In fact, as you
see below, I’ve actually modified it to pull the tweets from a file on
disk so I can avoid hitting the network on every run.</p>
<div class="lang-python editor-colors">import clr
clr.AddReference("System.Xml")
from System.Xml import XmlDocument

def get_nodes(xml):
    return xml.SelectNodes("statuses/status/text")

def download_stuff():
    x = XmlDocument()

    #load from disk to save time in development
    #x.Load("http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/devhawk.xml")
    x.Load("devhawk.xml")

    for n in get_nodes(x):
        txt = n.InnerText
        items.Add(txt)

download_stuff()

</div>
<p>OK, so that’s the basics of the world’s simplest hybrid C#/IronPython
Twitter application. Next up, I’ll add the settrace basics.</p>
