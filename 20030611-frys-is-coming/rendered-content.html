<p>I’m not the
<a href="http://technovangelist.com/blogs/default.aspx?date=06/11/03">first</a> to
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/06/11.html#a3311">report</a> this,
but <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134930115_frys07.html">Fry’s is coming to Renton in
mid-July</a>
(30 minutes from MSFT Campus). That’s Fry’s Electronics, not <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/06/03/driving-tour-of-phoenix/">Fry’s Food
&amp; Drug</a>.

Scoble called it the “most important news of the day”. Matt calls it
“Heaven”. +1</p>
<p>I moved up from Los Angeles to Seattle about 2 years ago and was shocked
there wasn’t a Fry’s anywhere nearby. (I didn’t know about the one
<a href="http://technovangelist.com/">Matt</a> mentioned in Oregon). Glad to see
this oversight is going to be rectified by next month.</p>
