for a the Washington Capitals developmental camp scrimmage last week
(My parents are in their somewhere). Standing room only in the
practice facility to watch a bunch of kids, most of whom won’t ever
make it to the NHL, in July. If you think Washington can’t be a
hockey town, you are sorely mistaken.</li>
<li>Speaking of the Caps, they are establishing a “<a href="http://capitals.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=23007">spirit
squad</a>“?
Is that really necessary? (short answer: no). <a href="http://peerlessprognosticator.blogspot.com/2008/07/weve-got-spirit-how-bout-you.html">Peerless’
take</a>
is hilarious.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv">Seshadri Vijayaraghavan</a> is a
tester on the DLR team and he’s been writing quite a bit about the
DLR hosting API. He’s got a series of posts about

<li>I haven’t seen an official announcement, but <a href="http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2008/07/17/microsoft-opens-up-live-mesh-for-basic-mobile-access.aspx">mobile access to Live
Mesh is
available</a>
by pointing your phone browser to <a href="http://m.mesh.com">http://m.mesh.com</a>. It’s mostly a
web view of the Live Desktop, though there is a feature to upload
photos from your phone. However, for some reason that feature
doesn’t work for me right now. I don’t get the “browse” button.</li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC Preview 4 is <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=15389">available for
download</a>.
Phil Haack has <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/07/16/aspnetmvc-codeplex-preview4.aspx">a few
details</a>
that ScottGu didn’t cover. Scott Hanselman shows off <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/ScottHanselman/%7E3/337456906/ASPNETMVCPreview4UsingAjaxAndAjaxForm.aspx">some AJAX
stuff</a>.</li>
<li>Speaking of Scott Hanselman, he
<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LearningOpportunityNETTerrariumIsBack.aspx">highlights</a>
the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/2008/07/16/reintroducing-terrarium-now-with-2-0-goodness.aspx">return of
Terrarium</a>
from <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/default.aspx">Bil Simser</a>.
Scott mentions that most Terrarium animal implementations were big
collections of nested if statements. I wonder if F# pattern
matching would be a cleaner approach?</li>
<li>Ted Neward obviously never “even tangentially” touched politics, as
I think they have far worse flame wars far more often than we have
in the software industry. However, certainly the Scala flame war
<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/07/16/Of+Zealotry+Idiocy+And+Etiquette.aspx">he’s commenting
on</a>
seems fairly counterproductive.</li>
<li>Brad Wilson <a href="http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2008/07/creating-nullab.html">runs into a
wall</a>
trying to convert a string to an arbitrary Nullable&lt;T&gt;.He doesn’t
find an answer, but I found reading thru the steps he took to try
and find an answer strangely compelling.</li>
<li>Jeff Atwood argues that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001152.html">Maybe Normalization isn’t
Normal</a>. It’s
mostly a collection of information from other places, including a
compilation of high-scale database case studies. But it’s a useful
collection of info and links, with a little common-sense thrown in
for good measure.</li>
