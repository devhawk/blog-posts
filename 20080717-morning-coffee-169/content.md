	:::
	for a the Washington Capitals developmental camp scrimmage last week
    (My parents are in their somewhere). Standing room only in the
    practice facility to watch a bunch of kids, most of whom won’t ever
    make it to the NHL, in July. If you think Washington can’t be a
    hockey town, you are sorely mistaken.
-   Speaking of the Caps, they are establishing a “[spirit
    squad](http://capitals.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NHLPage&id=23007)“?
    Is that really necessary? (short answer: no). [Peerless’
    take](http://peerlessprognosticator.blogspot.com/2008/07/weve-got-spirit-how-bout-you.html)
    is hilarious.
-   [Seshadri Vijayaraghavan](http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv) is a
    tester on the DLR team and he’s been writing quite a bit about the
    DLR hosting API. He’s got a series of posts about
    [hosting](http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/06/24/how-to-write-a-simple-dlr-host-in-c-using-hosting-api.aspx),
    [invoking](http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/06/30/how-to-invoke-a-python-function-from-c-using-the-dlr-hosting-api.aspx)
    and [redirecting
    output](http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/07/08/how-to-redirect-output-from-python-code-using-the-dlr-hosting-api.aspx)
    from IronPython in a C\# application.
-   I haven’t seen an official announcement, but [mobile access to Live
    Mesh is
    available](http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2008/07/17/microsoft-opens-up-live-mesh-for-basic-mobile-access.aspx)
    by pointing your phone browser to <http://m.mesh.com>. It’s mostly a
    web view of the Live Desktop, though there is a feature to upload
    photos from your phone. However, for some reason that feature
    doesn’t work for me right now. I don’t get the “browse” button.
-   ASP.NET MVC Preview 4 is [available for
    download](http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=15389).
    Phil Haack has [a few
    details](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/07/16/aspnetmvc-codeplex-preview4.aspx)
    that ScottGu didn’t cover. Scott Hanselman shows off [some AJAX
    stuff](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/337456906/ASPNETMVCPreview4UsingAjaxAndAjaxForm.aspx).
-   Speaking of Scott Hanselman, he
    [highlights](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LearningOpportunityNETTerrariumIsBack.aspx)
    the [return of
    Terrarium](http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/2008/07/16/reintroducing-terrarium-now-with-2-0-goodness.aspx)
    from [Bil Simser](http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/default.aspx).
    Scott mentions that most Terrarium animal implementations were big
    collections of nested if statements. I wonder if F\# pattern
    matching would be a cleaner approach?
-   Ted Neward obviously never “even tangentially” touched politics, as
    I think they have far worse flame wars far more often than we have
    in the software industry. However, certainly the Scala flame war
    [he’s commenting
    on](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/07/16/Of+Zealotry+Idiocy+And+Etiquette.aspx)
    seems fairly counterproductive.
-   Brad Wilson [runs into a
    wall](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2008/07/creating-nullab.html)
    trying to convert a string to an arbitrary Nullable\<T\>.He doesn’t
    find an answer, but I found reading thru the steps he took to try
    and find an answer strangely compelling.
-   Jeff Atwood argues that [Maybe Normalization isn’t
    Normal](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001152.html). It’s
    mostly a collection of information from other places, including a
    compilation of high-scale database case studies. But it’s a useful
    collection of info and links, with a little common-sense thrown in
    for good measure.
-   I have a hard time imagining [Pat Helland
    camping](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2008/07/16/a-weekend-at-foo-camp.aspx).
