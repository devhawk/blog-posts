<p>With the real and serious problem we face in this country – the civil
war in Iraq, the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, rebuilding New
Orleans, etc. - it boggles the mind that we waste any time at all on
faux controversies such as the so-called “War on Christmas”. Getting
<a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=2642061">Wal-Mart</a> to
use “Christmas” instead of “Holiday” in their marketing seems like a
dubious accomplishment at best.</p>
<p>But where I rail against such stupidity, my brilliant
<a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/">wife</a> writes poetry. One of Julie’s
conservative friends sent her an insipid poem that’s been making the
rounds on the Internet called “How The ‘Left’ Stole Christmas”. I must
have missed Wolf Blitzer changing his name to “Wolf Blitzen” or the
Senate passing legislation to take away Christian’s faith and forbid
them to speak of salvation and grace.</p>
<p>My response would have simply been “Read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">First
Amendment</a>,
idiot!”. My wife, however, wrote a <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!552.entry">poem of her own in
response</a>.
Check it out.</p>
