With the real and serious problem we face in this country – the civil
war in Iraq, the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, rebuilding New
Orleans, etc. - it boggles the mind that we waste any time at all on
faux controversies such as the so-called “War on Christmas”. Getting
[Wal-Mart](http://www.abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=2642061) to
use “Christmas” instead of “Holiday” in their marketing seems like a
dubious accomplishment at best.

But where I rail against such stupidity, my brilliant
[wife](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/) writes poetry. One of Julie’s
conservative friends sent her an insipid poem that’s been making the
rounds on the Internet called “How The ‘Left’ Stole Christmas”. I must
have missed Wolf Blitzer changing his name to “Wolf Blitzen” or the
Senate passing legislation to take away Christian’s faith and forbid
them to speak of salvation and grace.

My response would have simply been “Read the [First
Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution),
idiot!”. My wife, however, wrote a [poem of her own in
response](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!552.entry).
