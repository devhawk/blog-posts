[Sam](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/) and
[Don](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx) are arranging
another [Crossroads](http://www.crossroadsbellevue.com/) blogger
get-together on the 21st. Enjoyed the [last
time](http://devhawk.net/2003/01/30/dinner-weblogs-code/), but
will have to give this one a miss. 21st is my birthday and I hear that
my son Patrick has big plans.
