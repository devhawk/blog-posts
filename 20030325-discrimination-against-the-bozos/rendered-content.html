<p>The truth is that <strong>I discriminate against irrational people</strong>. If I
eventually find out that someone who I have discussions or debates
with makes irrational arguments to defend a personal bias then I tend
to pigeon-hole this person in my mind and set up a mental note to
redirect future commentary by this person to my mental “Deleted Items”
folder unless those comments are referenced by some other person whose
credibility is not suspect. [<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/3/25/135736/816">Dare Obasanjo aka
