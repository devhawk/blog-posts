I like how [Jim McCarthy](http://www.mccarthy-tech.com/) described this
in his landmark book [Dynamics of Software
Development](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1556158238/qid=1048658379/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-5069695-9950259?v=glance&s=books):
[Flipping the Bozo
Bit](http://www.agcs.com/supportv2/techpapers/patterns/bozobit.htm).

And on the subject of must reads from Jim McCarthy, check out [Software
for Your
Head](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201604566/ref=pd_sim_books_1/103-5069695-9950259?v=glance&s=books)
and the [Core Protocols
v1.0](http://www.mccarthy-tech.com/thecore10.pdf).
