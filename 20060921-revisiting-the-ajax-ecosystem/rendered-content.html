<p>Seven months and one job ago, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/13/thoughts-on-the-ajax-toolkit-spectrum/">wrote
this</a>
about AJAX toolkits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The network effect that <a href="http://web2.wsj2.com/web_20_design_the_ajax_spectrum.htm">Dion doesn’t
consider</a> is
the component ecosystem phenomenon that Microsoft has a ton of
experience with. Old school VB, COM/ActiveX and .NET have all had
large ecosystems of components and controls evolve that extend the
functionality of the baseline development platform. There’s no reason
to believe that won’t happen with Atlas. I think it’s wrong to
describe Atlas as a monolith or self-contained or enclosing. It’s an
extensible baseline platform – i.e. the baseline functionality is set
down once at the development platform and the ecosystem can extend it
from there. Sure, overlapping extensions happen (how many rich text
editor components are there for ASP.NET?) but at least they all have
basic compatibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I bring this up now because I saw on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2006/09/19/762781.aspx">Shawn Burke’s
blog</a> that
they’ve shipped the September release of the <a href="http://atlas.asp.net/atlastoolkit/">Atlas Control
Toolkit</a>. There are now 25 different
controls (they had 10 in their first release). But there’s something
more significant than the addition of 15 controls overall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://atlas.asp.net/atlastoolkit/Slider/Slider.aspx">Slider</a> is just
a super-useful little control.  There are so many times when you want
to let users use this type of UI.  Another great thing about Slider is
that it’s <strong>a 3rd party contribution, from</strong>
<a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/garbin/"><strong>Garbin</strong></a>, who did a great job
on it. (emphasis added)<br />

<p>I just wanted to brag that I called this 7 months ago.</p>
