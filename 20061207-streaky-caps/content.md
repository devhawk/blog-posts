Washington Capitals record in the past four games: 4-0\
Washington Capitals record in the past ten games: 4-4-2

That is what in the business of hockey you call “streaky”.

When your recent winning streak includes wins over Dallas (16-8 at the
time, 19-9 now) and Eastern conference leading Buffalo (20-3-2 then,
21-4-2 now), you can feel pretty good about yourself. Being only one
point out of the playoffs doesn’t hurt either.

On the other hand, the East is a beast this year. Only Florida and
Philadelphia are below .500. Everyone else is in the thick of the
playoff hunt. Another six game slide would really hurt the Caps’ playoff
chances. By comparison in the West, seven of the fifteen teams are below
.500 (i.e. everyone not currently in a playoff spot). Dallas, at ten
games over .500 is 3rd in the Pacific Division behind Anaheim (+18) and
San Jose (+12).

Finally, it’s always nice to be looking down on the Penguins in the
standings. But their not far behind. Their 26 points puts them in 13th
place in the East, but they’re at .500 (11-11-4) and only five points
out of a playoff spot. Next Monday’s game should be a good one. It’s
even on [national

in HD!
