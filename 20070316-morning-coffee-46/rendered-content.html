<p>Sort of late this morning due to back to back meetings…</p>
<ul>
<li>I seem to have stirred up a bit of a hornet’s nest with my “kinda
surprising that no other mainstream language has done this before”
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/13/morning-coffee-44/">comment</a>.
<a href="http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/clueless/">Dennis Hamilton</a> and Mike
Parsons both asked about other dynamic languages like Javascript and
Python in my comments. To be clear, the ability to add a new method
to a specific object instance is fairly common in dynamic languages.
Extension methods in C#3/VB9 is a different capability – it only
supports adding new methods to a class, not to specific object
instances. I’m not sure what dynamic languages other than Ruby
supports adding new methods to both object instances and classes,
but I’m sure they’re out there.</li>
<li>Some anonymous commenter asked “why invent another language for
PowerShell if there are so many great popular languages already in
existance [sic]?” I can’t speak for the PowerShell team, but I think
they were better off inventing a new language specificly designed
for their scenario than they would have been shoe-horning in
existing lanugage. To their credit, it looks like the PS team took
great care to make the PS lanugage accessable by leveraging common
syntax and idioms from other shell programming environments. I’m not
a shell programming expert, but isn’t PS more a variant of shell
languages that have come before than a brand new language?</li>
<li>I want a “<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000818.html">Works on My
Machine</a>”
T-Shirt.</li>
</ul>
