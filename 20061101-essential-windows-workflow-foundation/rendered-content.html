<p>On <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/10/25/41185.aspx">Don’s
recommendation</a>,
I picked up <a href="http://www.aw-bc.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0321399838,00.html">Essential
WF</a>.
In the forward, Don writes “[S]omething big is about to happen.” I’m
only part way thru chapter one, and this is already a must read. Go get
it. Now.</p>
<p>In the
<a href="http://www.aw-bc.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0321399838-PRE,00.html">preface</a>,
they define the term “Reactive Program”, which I’m adding to my personal
lexicon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) is a general-purpose programming
framework for creating reactive programs that act in response to
stimulus from external entities. The basic characteristic of reactive
programs is that they pause during their execution, for unknown
amounts of time, awaiting input.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That “unknown amounts of time” is the kicker. Here’s a paragraph from
early in chapter one that expands on that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Real-world processes take a long time – days, weeks, or even months.
It is wishful thinking to assume that the operating system process (or
CLR application domain) in which the program begins execution will
survive for the required duration.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gee, that <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/10/23/the-other-foundation-technology/">sounds
familiar</a>
doesn’t it?</p>
