I am so digging the new new [Windows Live Sign-in
Assistant](http://spaces.msn.com/winliveid/blog/cns!AEE1BB0D86E23AAC!222.entry).
If you haven’t seen it, it provides easy signin for people w/ multiple
~~Passports~~ Windows Live IDs. I use [Windows Live Custom
Domains](http://domains.live.com/) to manage my devhawk.net email (which
also rocks) which means I have my personal hotmail ID as well as my
devhawk email ID. With the sign-in assistant, I get a slick login UI
that lets me log in with either ID with a single click. Very nice. So
far, the new sign-in only seems to be enabled for [Windows Live
Ideas](http://ideas.live.com/), but I assume that will expand over time.

BTW, if you want this new sign-in experience, it looks like you need the
new beta of [Windows Live
Messenger](http://www.ideas.live.com/programPage.aspx?versionId=0eccd94b-eb48-497c-8e60-c6313f7ebb73).
There’s a bunch of other new stuff in the [latest
beta](http://spaces.msn.com/messengersays/Blog/cns!5B410F7FD930829E!14406.entry) -
new features, better perf and a more polished experience. AFAIK, you
still need to be invited to join the beta. I have a bunch of invites –
if you want one, [drop me a
line](mailto:devhawk@outlook.com?subject=WLM%20Invite).
