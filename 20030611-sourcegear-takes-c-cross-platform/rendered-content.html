<a href="http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=sourcegear">announcing</a>
a deal with <a href="http://www.ximian.com/">Ximian</a> today. We need Unix
clients for <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">SourceGear Vault</a>, but
alas, C# has no real cross-platform story. So we’ve agreed to give
Ximian a bag of money and they’ve agreed to hack
<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</a> and make it speak .NET XML Web
Services to ASP.NET. Vault users will be able to run our command-line
client on Linux, speaking to the Vault server, which will continue to
be Windows-only.</p>
<p>(Note that we are punting the cross-platform GUI issues for now. The
Vault GUI client uses Windows Forms. We’ll tackle non-Windows GUI
clients after we get the basic stuff working well.)</p>
<p>It’s easy to feel good about this kind of deal, and not just because
it’s an honor to work with Miguel de Icaza. Everybody gets something.
Vault users get more flexibility. Ximian gets revenue. All Mono users
get interop with .NET XML Web Services. The world is a [slightly]
better place.</p>

<p>Very interesting. Initial thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miguel de Icaza does, in fact, rock. But I’ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/01/30/dinner-weblogs-code/">said that
before</a>.</li>
<li>Apparently, C# does have a cross platform story. C# and CLI is an
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/ecma/">open standard</a>. Hopefully,
Mono’s success will spur others into building production
implementations of C# and CLI on still further platforms.</li>
<li>I’m very surprised that Mono didn’t already have XML web service
interop support. It’s true that Web Services support is not part of
the ECMA/ISO standard. But then again, neither is ASP.NET, ADO.NET
or VB and Mono has implementations of those.</li>
<li>They aren’t “.NET XML Web Services”, they’re just XML Web Services.
There are
<a href="http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/Basic/2003-05/BasicProfile-1.0-WGAD.htm">standards</a>
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl12/">in</a> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part0/">progress</a>)
for this as well.</li>
<li>Since Web Services are a supported on many platforms, SourceGear
could have built a Unix/Linux specific version of their command-line
tool in any language, especially Java which has several <a href="http://www.themindelectric.com/glue/index.html">Web
Service</a>
<a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">implementations</a>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/downloads/javaxmlpack.html">available</a>.
But for SourceGear, it appears that staying with C# and CLI was
very important. Eric is already <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/Abstraction_Pile.html">on
record</a> saying
that his company “made a great choice when we decided to build Vault
using .NET.” I don’t know how much “a bag of money” is, but I think
it’s telling they were willing to pay Ximian to add features to
their CLI implementation rather than to rewrite the command-line
client in Java and use freely available web service tools.</li>
<li>I wonder how they will eventually address cross-platform GUI issue.
Will they use Mono’s Win32/Wine emulator library or will they
rewrite with GTK#?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It was pointed out to me that the term used in the ECMA/ISO
spec is CLI, common language infrastructure, not CLR, common language
runtime. I’ve updated this post accordingly. Also, this post disappeared
for some period of time. Not sure why. But it’s back now.</p>
