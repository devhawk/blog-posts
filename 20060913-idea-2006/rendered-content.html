<p>I saw from <a href="http://blog.wired.com/sterling/">Bruce Sterling’s blog</a> that
he’s going to be at <a href="http://ideaconference.org/">Idea 2006</a> next month
in Seattle. Bruce is at or near the top of the list of “folks I’d like
to chat with over a few good beers”. I saw him at
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/07/etech-day-one/">ETech</a> and have since
read and thoroughly enjoyed both <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10603">Shaping
Things</a> and
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679463224">Tomorrow
Now</a>. I wonder
if I can make it to IDEA?</p>
