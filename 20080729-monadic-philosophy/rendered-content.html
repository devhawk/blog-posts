<p>(Since I accidentally <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/07/29/pushed-the-wrong-button/">published part
one</a> of this
series a few minutes ago, I figured I might as well start publishing the
series.)</p>
<p>If you start learning functional programming, eventually you’ll come
across the idea of a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29">monad</a>.
Coming from the object/imperative world of languages like C#, I’ve had
a hard time wrapping my head around this concept. There’s no shortage of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29#External_links">monad
tutorials</a>
out there, but most use <a href="http://www.prairienet.org/%7Edsb/monads.htm">Haskell’s
IO</a> as the prototypical
example of a monad. Given that I don’t know Haskell very well, I found
it hard to separate the Haskell stuff from monad stuff. So I set monads
on the back burner and decided not to worry about them.</p>
<p>However, all that changed when Stephan Tolksdorf alerted me to his very
cool monadic parser combinator library
<a href="http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec">FParsec</a>. I found the FParsec parsers
much easier to read <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/10/practical-parsing-in-f/">my F# parser
efforts</a>, so
I became very interested in monadic parser combinators. As you might
guess, a “monadic parser combinator library” makes heavy use of monads.
Time to switch burners.</p>
<p>The problem with learning monads with FParsec is that it’s really
designed for production use. I needed to break monads down to first
principles, so I rolled my own monadic parser library. Make no mistake,
if I were looking to build a production parser in F# right now, I’d use
with FParsec. My monadic parser library might “get there” eventually,
but right now it’s a toy.</p>
<p>Over a series of posts, I’m going to describe what I know about monads.
I didn’t set out to write a tutorial on monads – as I said, there are
plenty of them out there. However, I found most of the the many monad
tutorials I read lacking because the did a good job explaining the
“how”, but not such a good job on the “why”. Coming from an imperative
world, I wanted to understand the philosophy better. That being said,
there’s a lot of tutorial in and around the philosophy. Hopefully,
you’ll find both useful.</p>
