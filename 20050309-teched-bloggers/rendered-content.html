<p>I guess weâ€™re still three months out, but <a href="http://techedbloggers.net">TechEd
Bloggers</a> is just getting ramped up. Not to
many registered bloggers yet. So far, Iâ€™m the only registered blogger in
the <a href="http://techedbloggers.net/Bloggers/TechEd2005/Orlando/Staff.category">staff
category</a>.
Last year, I was staff and speaker (the only track owner also presenting
I might point out) but this year Iâ€™m in marketing so they didnâ€™t let me
speak!
ðŸ˜„
Actually, I picked all the ARC track sessions and speakers, so I have no
one to blame for myself. Yep, no one to blame but myself for
significantly easing my own workload to only worrying about organizing
the track, hanging out in the ARC cabanaÂ and hearding speakers (note to
self, get <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/">Tedâ€™s</a> mobile number
before the event starts) without the added worry of having to present.</p>
<p>Who else is going to Orlando?</p>
