<li>Saw Shrek the Third over the weekend with the kids. It’s gotten
<a href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/shrekthethird">mixed
reviews</a>, but I
liked it even though it wasn’t as good as the first two. Is it just
me, or has sequel-itis reached an all time high? This month alone
we’ve had <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413300/">Spiderman 3</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463854/">28
Weeks Later</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413267/">Shrek the
Third</a> and the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449088/">new Pirates
movie</a> opens this week.</li>
<li>Hot on the heels of his post on <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/15/new-orcas-language-feature-anonymous-types.aspx">anonymous
types</a>,
Scott Guthrie starts to explain <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx">LINQ to
SQL</a>,
which is where all these C#3/VB9 features have been headed. Lots of
digital ink have been spilled on this topic since we announced LINQ
@ PDC 05, so I’ll just point out that I think this is the first OR/M
solution that really works well across the board.</li>
<li>David Ing <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d75637fe-a7cc-4f18-b0bd-aecddafb9542">sucks the fun out of
PopFly</a>
by suggesting it might be a “nice data aggregation / reformatting
service for technically-challenged managers [and] their business
data”. Sounds like the next step of <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/11/23/browser-based-applications-in-the-enterprise/">enterprise
mashups</a>.</li>
<li>Speaking of PopFly, Larry O’Brein
<a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,652d0d73-23c3-409d-b3f0-3f8879e37bcb.aspx">thinks</a>
PopFly is helping restore ” the bridge between power users and
programmers”. From the <a href="http://www.popfly.com/Overview/faq.aspx">PopFly
FAQ</a>: “We’re going back to
our roots in 1975 when Microsoft originally launched BASIC for the
Altair 8080. Tools like BASIC and Visual Basic 1.0 democratized
development by enabling users to easily build applications on DOS
and Windows. We believe we can make Popfly a great tool for building
and sharing applications on the Web.”</li>

if Microsoft is losing the Alpha Geeks. In a related vein, I wonder
if MS should be learning more aggressively from the community. MS
has been the source of many developer innovations, but certainly not
all. For ideas pioneered elsewhere, we tend to eventually get it,
but I think we could be better about it.</li>
<li>Apparently, I’m just a little younger than video games. Pong <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3159462">was
born</a> May of 1967, only
three years to the month before me. (via
