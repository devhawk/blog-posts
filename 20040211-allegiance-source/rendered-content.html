<p>Again, I’m late to the story but I think it’s ultra-cool that MS
Research <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/allegiance/">released the source code to
Allegiance</a>. At 511
MB, it’s almost thirty times bigger than
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/sscli">Rotor</a> +
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/clrgen/">Gyro</a>, which is a
significant code release in itself, though honestly, only about 5% of
the Allegiance archive is code, the 95% is in the “Artwork”
subdirectory. That still leaves about 25MB of compressed code.</p>
<p>I’d love to see a port to MC++, a la <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/homepageheadlines/quake/default.aspx">Quake
II.NET</a>.
Is anyone working on it?</p>
