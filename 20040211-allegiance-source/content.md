Again, I’m late to the story but I think it’s ultra-cool that MS
Research [released the source code to
Allegiance](http://research.microsoft.com/research/allegiance/). At 511
MB, it’s almost thirty times bigger than
[Rotor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/sscli) +
[Gyro](http://research.microsoft.com/projects/clrgen/), which is a
significant code release in itself, though honestly, only about 5% of
the Allegiance archive is code, the 95% is in the “Artwork”
subdirectory. That still leaves about 25MB of compressed code.

I’d love to see a port to MC++, a la [Quake
II.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/homepageheadlines/quake/default.aspx).
Is anyone working on it?
