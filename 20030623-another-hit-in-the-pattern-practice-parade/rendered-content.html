<p>I didn’t notice right away, but there’s a new version of the <a href="http://microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=7A728E0E-EB15-499F-A4D7-5757C82B860D&amp;displaylang=en">Operating
.NET
Applications</a>
book. The original version was missing the chapter on Instrumenting .NET
applications since the Enterprise Instrumentation Framework (EIF) hadn’t
shipped yet. EIF is downloadable from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/resources/subdwnld.asp">MSDN Subscriber
Downloads</a>
for all Enterprise and Universal subscribers. The new version of the
book also contains information on Sizing and Capacity Planning.</p>
