I didn’t notice right away, but there’s a new version of the [Operating
.NET
Applications](http://microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=7A728E0E-EB15-499F-A4D7-5757C82B860D&displaylang=en)
book. The original version was missing the chapter on Instrumenting .NET
applications since the Enterprise Instrumentation Framework (EIF) hadn’t
shipped yet. EIF is downloadable from [MSDN Subscriber
Downloads](http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/resources/subdwnld.asp)
for all Enterprise and Universal subscribers. The new version of the
book also contains information on Sizing and Capacity Planning.
