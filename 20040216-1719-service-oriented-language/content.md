I like Jeff’s
[suggestions](http://schneider.blogspot.com/archives/2004_01_11_schneider_archive.html#107409153082470089)
for a Service Oriented Lanugage as well as RebelGeekz’
[idea](http://geekswithblogs.net/rebelgeekz/archive/2004/02/02/1686.aspx)
of how to include XML Infoset information in a language without
resorting to angle brackets. I wonder what a community developed
lanugauge would look like? I’ve experimented with
[Coco/R](http://dotnet.jku.at/Projects/Rotor) which really reduces the
effort it takes to build a parser. Of course, the language design and
code generation are the hard parts!

[Source for Coco/R](http://cocotools.sscli.net/) is available on the
[Rotor Community Projects
page](http://www.sscli.net/servlets/ProjectList). Other cool projects
include a port of Rotor to [WinCE](http://wince-port.sscli.net/), two
different AOP projects – [one for C\#](http://aop-in-csharp.sscli.net/)
and the other [language neutral](http://aspect-dot-net.sscli.net/) and a
set of [improved collections](http://aspect-dot-net.sscli.net/).
