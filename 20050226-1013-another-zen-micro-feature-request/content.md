The other day, I
[wished](http://devhawk.net/2005/02/23/experimenting-with-podcasting/) my Zen
Micro supported variable speed playback for podcast playback. I’ve got
another feature request, this time for podcast recording. The Zen Micro
[features](http://www.nomadworld.com/products/zen_Micro/features.asp) include
built in microphone and support for voice recording. But there doesn’t
appear to be any way to hook up an external microphone. The built-in mic
is fine for leaving messages for yourself, but it’s not high enough
quality for podcasting “on the go”. Additionally, since I’m using WMP 10
instead of the app that comes with the Zen Micro, I’m not sure there’s
any way to sync the recorded files back down to my PC, but I’m thinking
that’s just a matter of geting [Notmad
Explorer](http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/) talking to my Zen
Micro.

**Update**: Sometime shortly after I blogged this, Adam curry
[posted](http://www.curry.com/2005/02/26#a2979) an episode of DSC
recorded on a Zen Micro that Sean [gave
him](http://blog.seanalexander.com/PermaLink,guid,a3fe0c9d-b320-4e08-a1e1-b3ab5426f24b.aspx).
I haven’t had a chance to listen yet, but I’m interested in how it
sounds and how well it worked for Adam. Do you have to hold it near your
mouth the whole time? I still wish I could use an external mic.
