<p>A few random thoughts on yesterday:</p>
<p>Though some in the progressive blogosphere disagree, I thought <a href="http://www.pic2009.org/blog/entry/president_obamas_inaugural_address/">Obama’s
inaugural
speech</a>
was very good. His start, contrasting taking the oath of office “during
rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace” (as now-former
President Bush did <a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>) versus taking the oath as he does “amidst
gathering clouds and raging storms” really set the tone for the whole
speech. With Bush sitting right there – mere feet from the podium –
Obama categorically rejected almost every policy of the Bush
administration. When they cut to a shot of Bush in the middle, he didn’t
seem to be enjoying Obama’s speech very much. In a way, I was reminded
of Steven Colbert’s <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-869183917758574879">epic
performance</a>
at the White House Correspondents Dinner a few years ago. Of course, the
difference was that Colbert was speaking truth <em>to</em> power while Obama
is speaking truth <em>from</em> power.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ex-President Bush (man, <a href="http://twitter.com/DevHawk/status/1134079689">I love writing
that</a>) I can say a lot of
negative things about him, but I will grudgingly commend him on handling
the transition. However, it does feel like it’s grading him on a massive
curve: “Sure he’s been an abysmal president, but at least he was able to
peacefully hand over the reigns of power without fucking that up too.”</p>
<p>I felt sorry for <a href="http://www.pic2009.org/blog/entry/elizabeth_alexander_inaugural_profile/">Elizabeth
Alexander</a>,
the poet who had to speak after President Obama’s inaugural speech.
Everyone started heading for the exits after Obama was done. I hope
those early exiters could hear Reverend Lowery’s benediction, it <a href="http://usatoday.com/communities/religion/post/2009/01/61651854/1?imw=Y">was
awesome</a>.
I realize Reverend Warren was a controversial pick to deliver the
invocation – certainly, I’m not a fan – but I respect Obama for being
inclusive of all-viewpoints. And while having a quartet with the likes
of Itzhak Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma was awesome, I especially liked John
Williams’ inaugural piece “Air and Simple Gifts”. But wouldn’t the theme
to Superman have been more appropriate?
😄</p>
<p>Finally, I skipped the rest of the pre and post inauguration analysis
and commentary other than the Countdown podcast which I listen to on my
way to work most days. Frankly, I didn’t need to be reminded of what an
historic day it was. Res ipsa loquitur.</p>
