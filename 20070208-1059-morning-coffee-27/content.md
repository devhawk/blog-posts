-   Is there a good solution to colorize source code that looks good in
    RSS feeds? I’ve tried [Insert
    Code](http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=1f57bd9b-a692-4593-9e9e-e2962d9c0eee&l=8)
    and [Paste from
    VS](http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=d8835a5e-28da-4242-82eb-e1a006b083b9&l=8) for
    [WL
    Writer](http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionid=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1)
    and both look fine in HTML but awful in RSS.
-   My friend [David
    Geller](http://www.whatcounts.com/blog?pid=965AABA79286169C)
    launched his latest venture [Eyejot](http://www.eyejot.com)
    recently. Eyejot is a Flash-based video messaging system, so you can
    send and receive video clips without having to install anything but
    a webcam. According to the [Eyejot blog](http://blog.eyejot.com/),
    they’re getting some good press. See an interview with David about
    Eyejot [up on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGMRLMFLdF4).
-   Here’s an [interesting
    article](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?entryID=635&ref=featured)
    on using WF with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service. Invoking MTurk
    isn’t that interesting – it’s just a web service and WF has a
    built-in InvokeWebService activity. But since MTurk has no way to
    asynchronously call out to the WF, you have no choice but to
    regularly poll MTurk to see if the task is complete. Yuck. (via

-   [Yahoo! Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/) looks interesting. At least
    the screen shots of it on various websites and blogs look cool. Too
    bad the site is absolutely hammered this morning. (via [Dare
    Obasanjo](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=258d634c-df5e-4420-a986-3e9d87a8f6da))
-   Like
    [GAT](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718948.aspx)?
    Like [DSL](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718368.aspx)?
    Then [use them
    together](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa905334.aspx)!
-   If I can more than [raise my
    Gamerscore](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0205-xboxrewards.htm)
    by 1,500 points by April 12th (i.e. more than double it), I can get
    a [free \$5 game](http://www.xbox.com/games/contraxboxlivearcade/).
    But why wait to start the contest until next Monday? Doesn’t that
    discourage people from playing until then?
