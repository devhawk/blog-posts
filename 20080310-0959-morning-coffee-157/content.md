-   My Xbox 360 started flashing the dreaded [Red Ring of
    Death](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/907534) on Friday. \<sigh\>
    I’m not going to have much time to play in the next week, so it’s
    not the end of the universe, but I did have to dig an old DVD player
    out of the garage for interim duty.
-   My Caps really stepped in it over the weekend dropping two games
    they had to have and by most reports (aka according to my dad) that
    they dominated most of the way. Caps Playoff Math isn’t as dire as
    say Clinton’s Nomination Math, but they are three games back of the
    Hurricanes with twelve to play.
-   Ted Neward has a pretty good [F\# overview
    article](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164244.aspx) in
    the most recent MSDN Magazine. I say pretty good because I wonder if
    someone with no functional programming experience will “get it”. As
    much as I like F\# and functional programming, I think some of the
    basic concepts don’t pass Don Box’s [two beer
    test](http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/02/05/microsoft-readying-model-driven-programming-tools/).
-   Speaking of Ted, somehow his feed fell off my radar (bad DevHawk!)
    and I missed several great posts like [Modular
    Toolchains](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/02/18/Modular+Toolchains.aspx)
    (note to Ted, check out [A Research C\#
    Compiler](http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?msr_tr_id=MSR-TR-2003-32)),
    [Why we need both static and dynamic in the same
    language](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/02/18/Why+We+Need+Both+Static+And+Dynamic+In+The+Same+Language.aspx)
    (note to self, check out [Cobra](http://cobra-language.com/)) and
    [The Fallacies
    Remain….](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/02/20/The+Fallacies+Remain.aspx)
    (recently, I’m the guy shouting about risks).
-   Speaking of MSDN Magazine, have you seen their [new site
    redesign](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/default.aspx)? I
    can’t find any announcement of it, but man the site looks great.
-   If you missed MIX, the [sessions](http://sessions.visitmix.com/) are
    all online already. That was fast.
-   John Lam
    [blogs](http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-3.html) about
    the availability of the [Dynamic Silverlight
    bits](http://dynamicsilverlight.net/). Apparently, Dynamic
    Silverlight includes more recent bits than the [Silverlight 2
    SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=4E03409A-77F3-413F-B108-1243C243C4FE&displaylang=en),
    which does includes binaries and tools for IronPython, IronRuby and
    Managed JScript
    ([quickstart](http://silverlight.net/Quickstarts/ProgramDlr.aspx)).
    So you can get started with dynamic languages on Silverlight using
    the SL SDK alone, but I expect that the Dynamic Silverlight bits
    will be updated more regularly than the SDK.
