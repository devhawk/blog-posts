<p>Shortly after posting <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/02/20/morning-coffee-148/">today’s morning
coffee</a>, I notice
two “blogging advisories” in my inbox from the XNA team. They’re
announcing two things: <a href="http://forums.xna.com/ShowThread.aspx?PostID=46553">XNA Game Studio
3.0</a> and <a href="http://forums.xna.com/ShowThread.aspx?PostID=46554">Xbox LIVE
Community Games</a>.</p>
<p>Given that there was an XNA Game Studio 1.0 and 2.0, news that there
will be a 3.0 version releasing this holiday season isn’t what veteran
bloggers like myself call “a surprise”. However, the news that XNA GS
3.0 is going to support development of Zune based games was quite a
surprise. Rumors of a Microsoft hand held gaming device crop up every
few months, but there’s never been any substance to them. The Zune isn’t
really a handheld gaming device like the DS or PSP – the
<a href="http://forums.xna.com/ShowThread.aspx?PostID=46553">FAQ</a> points out
that it will take “creative thinking” to build a game for a device with
a 240×320 display that’s designed for one hand use. Furthermore, Cesar
“Zune Insider” Menendez points out that “Zune is a wireless music and
video player first and foremost”.</p>
<p>Still, it’s pretty cool to think about what a Zune based game experience
would be like. So far we know it’ll be 2D only and it have full access
to any non-DRM music on the device. Also, it will be social – Zune XNA
games will support wireless multiplayer with up to 8 players, though it
doesn’t support cross-platform networking with Xbox and Windows. I can’t
wait to see what the community does with this capability. I’ll
definitely be getting a Zune now.</p>
<p>As for the Xbox LIVE Community Games, it’s something the XNA folks have
been <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16618">hinting at since last
year</a>. This
is the announcement the XNA folks have been building towards since day
one when they called XNA the “<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/14/microsoft-planning-youtube-for-games/">YouTube for
videogames</a>“.
Very much unlike the retail or arcade Xbox channels, Community Games
will be peer-reviewed by XNA Creators Club community members instead of
Microsoft (though unsurprisingly, MS “reserves the right to reactively
take down a game without prior notification”). You’ll even be able to
sell your games, though details on that won’t be available until later
in the year.</p>
<p>Like XNA GS 3.0, Community Games will be available “during the holiday
2008 season.” However, for the next month, Microsoft is offering a
preview of Community Games, offering seven community developed games for
free, including <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0813-dreambuildplaywinners.htm">last year’s DreamBuildPlay
co-winner</a>
“<a href="http://skasoftware.wordpress.com/category/the-dishwasher/">The Dishwasher: Dead
Samurai</a>“. I
can’t wait to get home and try them out.</p>
<p>IMO, this is a <em>huge</em> announcement. But what’s most impressive to me is
how much they’ve accomplished in a fairly short time. XNA was only
announced two and a half years ago. That’s amazing progress for a pretty
small team. I can’t wait to see what they do next.</p>
