-   My friend David “LetsKillDave” Weller [writes a long
    post](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LetsKillDave/~3/128471126/penny-arcade-s-jerry-quot-tycho-quot-holkins-gripes-about-microsoft-blogging-i-respond.aspx)
    on corporate blogging, responding to [comments on the
    subject](http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/06/27#1182927600) from
    Penny Arcade. Andre “Ozymandias” Vrignaud [also
    responds](http://ozymandias.com/archive/2007/06/27/Penny-Arcade-on-Microsoft-Bloggers.aspx).
    David is specifically talking about blogging within the gaming
    division, but they apply pretty broadly to Microsoft as a whole when
    it comes to blogging. “I don’t want to get fired”, “I don’t want to
    do things that needlessly hurt my company” and “We can say things
    that PR or marketing people can’t.  Or won’t.” all ring true to me.
-   Speaking of gaming, there seems to be more that your average cool
    games coming our for Xbox 360 this summer. I just picked up Forza 2
    which rocks with the Racing Wheel. [The
    Darkness](http://www.xbox.com/games/thedarkness/) looks very cool
    and I laughed my ass off playing the
    [Overlord](http://www.xbox.com/games/overlord) demo. Both shipped
    this week and have gotten [good
    reviews](http://www.metacritic.com/games/xbox360/). On their way in
    August are [Bioshock](http://www.xbox.com/games/bioshock/) and [Blue
    Dragon](http://www.xbox.com/games/bluedragonxbox360/). Of course,
    there are a
    [few](http://www.xbox.com/games/grandtheftautoiv/)
    [other](http://www.xbox.com/games/assassinscreed/)
    [big](http://www.xbox.com/games/halo3)
    [games](http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect/)
    coming this holiday. A good, but expensive, year to be a gamer.
-   I laughed my ass off reading Larry O’Brien’s [Top 10 Things To Do
    With Your Petaflop
    Supercomputer](http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,0447726e-8ac1-46b2-8cf5-22afb7eb3cc5.aspx),
    esp. \#9.
-   WSDL 2.0, it’s official. Nick Allen has the
    [news](http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/06/28/wsdl-2-0-completed.aspx).
    Personally, WSDL seems to be the spec most responsible for driving
    RPC-style request/response web services, so let’s just say that I am
    not a fan.  
-   Joe McKendrick
    [thinks](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=905) *something*
    is “holding back SOA”? I don’t think it’s any one thing, but
    certainly the RPC style that most web service toolkits pretty much
    force down your throat isn’t helping.
-   Nick Malik
    [thinks](http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/06/27/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions/)[Acropolis](http://windowsclient.net/acropolis/)
    is promising as a SOA service consumer, but Udi Dalan
    [thinks](http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/06/27/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions/http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/06/27/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions/)
    it doesn’t support multi-threading well enough. I lean towards Nick
    on this one since I see multi-threading as a language problem, which
    a library like Acropolis can’t solve on it’s own.
-   Jon Flanders [has been
    busy](http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon/PermaLink,guid,01a499d4-9aa3-4902-bafd-fae03cb89d13.aspx)
    building the [BizTalk Server 2006 extensions for Windows Workflow
    Foundation (June CTP) SDK
    Sample](https://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=437).
    I’m not sure why the marketing folks gave this such a long and
    involved name, but the sample does look pretty cool. Paul Andrews
    has the [project
    overview](http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2007/06/04/biztalk-adapter-for-windows-workflow-foundation-sample-june-2007-ctp.aspx)
    and [demo video](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=6902574). However,
    given that the WF workflows are hosted in BTS, is it accurate to say
    “[No Biztalk Experience
    Required](http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2007/06/27/no-biztalk-experience-required.aspx)“?
-   Speaking of WF, Tomas Restrepo [takes a detailed
    look](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/06/28/WorkflowServicesInOrcas.aspx)
    at the new WF service hosting in .NET FX 3.5. Mostly, he likes what
    he sees. I have the same problem he does with the message
    correlation IDs. I’d like to have other options here, including
    support for what I call “message data correlation” (Tomas describes
    this as “natural correlating identifiers”) and “address correlation”
    which is basically the REST model.
