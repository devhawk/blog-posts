It’s been a hard year so far for IT industry luminaries. (via <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/03/sad_news_john_backus_has_died.php">Good

<li>Yesterday, I followed on Martin Fowler’s post on going
transactionless. As I said yesterday, I didn’t agree with the idea
of no transactions inside a service, but I agree 100% with no
transactions between services. Via Paul Brown, <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2007/03/20/not-quite-no-transactions">we
learn</a>
that EBay does allow forbids the use of <em>client-side or distributed
transactions</em>, but doesn’t outlaw the use of transactions in
general. That makes much more sense to me since transactions between
services would have to be are distributed.</li>
