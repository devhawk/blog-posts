[Jason Bock](http://www.jasonbock.net) left me a comment that heâ€™s
covering Lang.NET over at his [.NET
Languages](http://www.dotnetlanguages.net) site. His coverage of day one
is
[here](http://www.dotnetlanguages.net/DNL/Default.aspx?blog=entry.642214e241e44969874238d5002f6f45).
Looking forward to his coverage of day two and three!
