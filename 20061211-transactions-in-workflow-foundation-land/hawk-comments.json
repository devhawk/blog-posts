    "content": "The WF transaction model makes more sense if you come from a BizTalk background (like me), because BizTalk has essentially the same restriction. \n\nThat said, BizTalk is far, far more flexible in its transaction facilities, but you still have to remember that message receive and send operations operate in completely separate transactions from orchestrations. However, this is improved in BizTalk because you have the MessageBox right in the middle of the messaging engine and the orchestration engine which makes implementing your kind of scenario completely natural even under the two-transaction separation.\n\nI'm not quite sure I agree about the whole poison message thingie, though. First of all, handling \"real\" poison messages (i.e. malformed ones that you really need to discard) requires breaking In-order delivery semantics if you hope to keep processing. The only way to avoid if the problematic message is important is to completely stop processing, fix the offending message(s) and resume processing. And this, I think, pretty much is all across the board (not specific to SSSB or MSMQ). \n\nSecond, MSMQ does support in-order delivery, afaik, for *messages sent in the same transaction*. This is key because MSMQ doesn't have the notion of a conversation/dialog like SSSB does (though it's certainly possible to implement it if you really want it). That said, I think you may be talking more about \"in-order processing\", which is a completely different thing, and which you seem to be dismissing. I'm not quite sure why you'd care so much about in-order delivery if you're not doing in-order processing after that (i.e. message 2 might finish processing before message-1 does), so that might be something to consider.\n\n"

    "content": "I'm not very deep on BizTalk, but I'm working on it. That said, comparing the high-level TX capabilities of a product like BizTalk to the low-level TX capabilities of a technology like WF is an apples to oranges comparison. From what I understand about MessageBox, it sounds fairly similar to SSB, which would make a SSB/WF implementation conceptually similar to BizTalk. But I need to learn much more about BizTalk.\n\nI agree 100% that dealing with poison messages need to be fixed before you can resume processing. But the silver lining of the two transaction approach to SSB & WF is that you're only stalling the instance with the poision message. If you left the poison message in the SSB queue, it would keep getting picked up until and throwing an exception until an operator came along to do something. If you move it to WF, then it will only effect the instance that message is intended for.\n\nI'm not dismissing in-order processing at all. It's one of the primary values of SSB in my opinon. Assuming WF doesn't reorder messages in a queue, moving them from SSB to WF wouldn't break the in order semantics.\n\n"

    "content": "Harry,\n\nI just realized I misread your original post and didn't notice that you were delivering all messages in a single conversation group to a single workflow instance. In that case, you're probably maintaining ordered processing. FWIW, seems you're implementing the kind of solution that is usually handled in Biztalk through a feature known as Convoys (look them up, the details might be useful to you at least for ideas, I think)\n\nBTW, the BizTalk MessageBox is far more than SSB, though they share some features, I think. Mostly, the MsgBox does not only queuing, it's also the underlying Pub/Sub and content-based routing engine in BizTalk. I do think it might be possible to implement the message box on top of SSB, and maybe the BizTalk team might explore that for possible performance improvements in future releases. \n\nAnd yes, I realize I'm a pita sometimes nagging about biztalk (but I do think for the kind of work you're doing, knowing how biztalk manages some of it would prove useful)."
