<p>Sure has been quiet around here. Standard end of the fiscal year
craziness. Plus, I had some dogfood issue w/ XP SP2 RC1, Office 2003 SP1
beta and NewsGator. Upgrading to XP SP2 RC2 seems to have solved the
problem. Regardless of the cause, I’m way behind reading which in turn
leaves me way behind writing.</p>
<p>I’ve blogged about <a href="http://softwarefactories.com/">Software Factories</a>
before, but from under the mountain of unread blogs I see Keith
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2004/06/18/159710.aspx">blogged</a>
about how <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem">VSTS</a> will
support software factories. He posted an excerpt from an article he’s
working on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A software factory is a product line that configures extensible
development tools like Visual Studio Team System (VSTS) with packaged
content and guidance, carefully designed for building specific kinds
of applications. A software factory contains three key ideas: a
software factory schema, a software factory template and an extensible
development environment.</p>
