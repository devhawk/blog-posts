<p>I downloaded the cool Matrix <a href="http://zmatrix.sf.net/">animated
wallpaper</a> and <a href="http://www.mvr.us/screen_savers/">screen
saver</a> that I read about on <a href="http://erablog.net/blogs/sean">Sean
Alexander’s blog</a>. I thought it was
interesting that the animated wallpaper configuration utility has a
“Hire the Developer” menu item that basically was a prose version of his
resume.</p>
