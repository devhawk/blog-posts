Async controller assumes that the service implements Event-based Asynchronous Pattern or BeginMethod/EndMethod Pattern (or at least documentation assumes). Your example here calls DownloadStringTaskAsync which assumes GET or REST service.\nSo, I am not sure if I can call WebRequest.GetResponse asynchronously and just don't know how; or it is only possible for specially crafted services (and then Async CTP just simplifies what is already available)."
