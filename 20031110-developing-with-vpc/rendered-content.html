on my laptop dev config. I used to have two machines, my “production”
machine for email and other office productivity and the my “development”
machine that I wouldn’t mind paving at a moments notice, if needed. Now,
I only have one machine so I can’t afford to be able to pave with
extreme prejudice. Since I have a honkin’ laptop (2.4 GHz P4, 1GB RAM,
85GB HD) I decided to go the VPC approach. All I have installed in my
host is Office 2003, SharpReader and VPC 2004 (it <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2003/nov03/11-10VPC2004RTMPR.asp">went gold
today</a>,
so I upgraded). However, I have <em>six</em> VPC’s I’m managing. I can’t run
them all at the same time of course, but it does give me a lot of
flexibility. I run two primary VPC’s – one for
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp">WinXP</a> and one for
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx">WS03</a>. I’m
actually running the WinXP VPC in the background as I blog – I’m
installing the <a href="http://www.vsipdev.com">VSIP SDK</a> (with the <a href="http://www.vsipdev.com/extrasbeta/default.aspx">VSIP Extras
Beta</a> on deck). Then I
have three dogfood VPCs – Longhorn, Whidbey and Indigo. Finally, I have
a WS03 VPC running
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx">WSS</a>. I need
to upgrade my <a href="prj_sharepointsynd.aspx">SharePoint Syndication
project</a> to support WSS RTM, but I just haven’t
had the time.</p>
<p>Internally, we have a group that produces demo images and VPC’s for the
technical field. So if I’m going to demo BTS 2004, I don’t have to go
thru all the install process – I can either run a VPC or image my
machine. Typically, I just use their base image VPC’s and install what I
need.</p>
<p>Only downside to this approach – chews battery life like there is no
tomorrow. I have two spare batteries and was completely drained of power
going coast-to-coast a few weeks ago.</p>
