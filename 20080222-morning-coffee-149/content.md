-   Big news yesterday was Microsoft announcing “[Strategic Changes in
    Technology and Business Practices to Expand
    Interoperability](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-21ExpandInteroperabilityPR.mspx)“.
    More details available at the new [Interoperability
    website](http://www.microsoft.com/interop/) and [this
    interview](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2008/feb08/02-21Muglia.mspx)
    with Bob Muglia.
-   The videos from Lang.NET 2008 are [now
    available](http://langnetsymposium.com/talks.asp), including
    [mine](http://langnetsymposium.com/talks/3-03%20-%20Parsing%20Expression%20Grammars%20in%20FSharp%20-%20Harry%20Pierson.html).
-   Mix08 is just under two weeks away, and the news is ramping up.
    Scott Guthrie provides a “[first
    look](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/22/first-look-at-silverlight-2.aspx)”
    at the Silverlight 2.0 beta (aka the one with .NET) that will
    release @ Mix. He also provides a set of eight tutorials where he
    demonstrates building a Digg client for Silverlight 2.0. I’ve been
    doing a little Silverlight 1.0 experimentation recently, but I think
    I’m going to scrap it in favor of waiting for 2.0.
-   Shorter Nick Malik: IoC is cool, but isn’t a silver bullet. Go read
    the
    [whole](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2008/02/15/what-is-the-tradeoff-with-inversion-of-control-ioc.aspx)
    thing.
-   Brad Wilson has a [new laptop with a solid-state hard
    drive](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2008/02/dell-xps-m1330.html).
    VS08 installs in under 10 minutes? I gotta get me one of those…
-   In addition to the XNA news, Microsoft also
    [announced](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/02/20/GDC08Portfolio.aspx)
    [Gears of War 2](http://www.xbox.com/games/gearsofwar2), 
    [Fable 2](http://www.xbox.com/games/fable2/) and 
    [Ninja Gaiden II](http://www.xbox.com/games/ninjagaiden2/) and 
    [Too Human](http://www.xbox.com/games/toohuman) will all be available
    this year exclusively on Xbox 360. Of those, I’m most interested in
    Fable 2, though Too Human is looking interesting. But what about
    [Halo Wars](http://www.xbox.com/games/halowars/)? When is that
    shipping?
