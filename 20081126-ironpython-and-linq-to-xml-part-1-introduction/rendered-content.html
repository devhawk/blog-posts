<p>Shortly after I joined the VS Languages team, we had a morale event that
included a <a href="http://www.rockband.com/">Rock Band</a> tournament. I didn’t
play that day in the tournament since I had never played before, but I
was hooked just the same. I got <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/rockband">Rock
Band</a> for my birthday, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/rockband2">Rock Band
2</a> shortly after it came out in
September and I’m hoping to get the <a href="http://www.rockband.com/games/acdc">AC/DC Track
Pack</a> for Christmas.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.rockband.com/music/songs">lots of songs</a> available
for Rock Band – 461 currently available between on-disc and downloadable
tracks – with more added every week. Frankly, there’s lots of music on
that list that I don’t recognize. Luckily, I’m also a <a href="http://www.zune.net/software/zunepass/">Zune
Pass</a> subscriber, so I can go
out and download all the Rock Band tracks and listen to them on my Zune.
But who has time to manually search for 461 songs? Not me. So I wrote a
little Python app to download the list of Rock Band songs and save it as
a Zune playlist.</p>
<p>I ended up use Linq to XML very heavily in this project. Zune playlists
use the same XML format as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb249686.aspx">Windows
playlists</a>, Zune
exposes the backend music catalog via a Atom feeds and I used <a href="http://www.lovettsoftware.com/blogs/blog.aspx?id=56">Chris
Lovett’s
SgmlReader</a> to
expose the HTML list of Rock Band songs as XML. I realize Linq to XML
wasn’t on “<a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/11/12/ironpython-and-insert-msft-technology-here/">the
list</a>”,
but I had a specific need so it got bumped to the head of the line.</p>
<p>BTW, for those who just want <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Zune/rockband.zpl">the
playlist</a>,
I stuck it on my Skydrive. Unfortunately, there’s no Skydrive API right
now, so I can’t automate uploading the new playlist every week. If
anyone has alternative suggestions or a way to programmatically upload
files to SkyDrive, let me know.</p>
