<p>From Sean Alexander’s <a href="http://blog.seanalexander.com/">Addicted to Digital
Media</a> blog, I learned that the Dish
Network is planning on bringing a <a href="http://blog.seanalexander.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d4ab807b-d01d-4f6c-a283-c5fcc4ebba03">HDTV-PVR
system</a>
to market in a few weeks. I was just begining to wonder about HDTV + PVR
functionallity. I’m really interested in how <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/">Media
Center</a> systems will
incorporate this functionallity. I really dig the new <a href="http://www.gateway.com/dw/home/fmc901_proddesc.shtml">Gateway Media
Center</a> with it’s
stereo-component form factor. According to the specs, it has Composite
A/V inputs to the TV Tuner card. Does that mean it can PVR HDTV too?</p>
