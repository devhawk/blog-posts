From Sean Alexander’s [Addicted to Digital
Media](http://blog.seanalexander.com/) blog, I learned that the Dish
Network is planning on bringing a [HDTV-PVR
system](http://blog.seanalexander.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d4ab807b-d01d-4f6c-a283-c5fcc4ebba03)
to market in a few weeks. I was just begining to wonder about HDTV + PVR
functionallity. I’m really interested in how [Media
Center](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/) systems will
incorporate this functionallity. I really dig the new [Gateway Media
Center](http://www.gateway.com/dw/home/fmc901_proddesc.shtml) with it’s
stereo-component form factor. According to the specs, it has Composite
A/V inputs to the TV Tuner card. Does that mean it can PVR HDTV too?
