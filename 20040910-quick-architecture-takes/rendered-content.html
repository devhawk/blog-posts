<p>It’s been quiet around here as I’m prepping for my next trip abroad.
TechEd <a href="http://www.teched.com.my/">Malaysia</a> and
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/china/teched/default.asp">Bejing</a> are next
week and I’m presenting at both, plus I’m stopping over in Tokyo to meet
with the local field architects. Should be pretty cool. I did TechEd
Malaysia two years ago, but I’ve never been to China before so I’m
pretty excited.</p>
<p>A few short takes before I go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three more Architecture Strategy team members are blogging: Josh
Less, Norman Guadagno and Drew Gude.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/finservguy">Josh</a> is the “FinServGuy”,
focusing on the architecture, patterns and standards in the
financial services industry. He just started on our team and
just started his blog. Go check out his post on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/finservguy/archive/2004/09/10/227897.aspx">Insurance
Value
Chain</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/">Norman</a> actually not a
team member yet and he’s the blogging vet of these three. When
he starts in October, Norman will be our marketing manager, a
skill set that we’ve been sorely missing around here. His blog –
<a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/">Atlas Brand View</a> – has no
coverage of architecture per se, but interesting marketing
tidbits like <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/2004/05/eight-reasons-marketing-makes-sense.html">Eight Reasons Marketing Makes
Sense</a>
and <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/2004/05/whatever-happened-to-burger-king.html">Whatever Happened To Burger
King</a>.
Can’t wait to see what he writes about architecture marketing.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drewg">Drew</a> is a vertical architect like
Josh, but focused on automotive and manufacturing. He’s doing
some cool work with RFID and is a member of the <a href="http://www.frontlinetoday.com/frontline/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=113816">RosettaNet
Architecture Advisory
Committee</a>.
However, as I write this, Drew has yet to blog anything. I keep
hearing how he’s working on something but since I’m going out of
town I figured I could put a bit of a squeeze to get him to
post.
😄</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I’m stoked about the <a href="http://www.dotnetlanguages.net/DNL/Default.aspx">.NET
Languages</a> site.
Not much up there yet, but I subscribed. Given my interest in
software factories and domain-specific languages, I guess this isn’t
a surprise. But my interest in language design goes <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/01/17/disruptive-programming-language-technologies/">way
back</a>
to the early days of my blog. BTW, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130622966/netlanguag-20">Compiling for the .NET
CLR</a>
is a great book.</li>
<li>I hung out with new-red-pill-taker <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/">Peter
Provost</a> last weekend. Our families
went to <a href="http://www.bumbershoot.com/">Bumbershoot</a> together. With my
18 month old son and Peter’s 30 month old daughter, there was
little, if any, debauchery – unless riding the kiddy rollercoaster
when you’re not really tall enough counts.  There was, however, lots
of geek talk, at least when the wifes were off doing other things.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve got some cool stuff “in the works” which I hope to talk about more
when I get back. I have 35 hours on airplanes in the next ten days, so I
get a chance to bang out some code.</p>
