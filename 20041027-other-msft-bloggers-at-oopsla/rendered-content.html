<p>Some other ‘softies blogging OOPSLA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keith Short <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2004/10/27/248583.aspx">talks
about</a>
the DSL Tutorial and apologizes for our keynote demo.</li>
<li>Steve Cook <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook">talks about</a> the MDA
panel and says the keynote demo “wasn’t such a great idea”</li>
<li>Stuart Kent <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2004/10/27/248260.aspx">describes the DSL
Toolkit</a>
and calls the keynote demo a “commercial break”</li>
<li>Michael Lehman briefly <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/10/27/248491.aspx">describes his
work</a>
building a software factory for the DSL Tutorial and
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/10/27/248580.aspx">blogs</a>
Jack’s GPCE keynote presentation on Software Factories</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Brant Carter <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView.aspx?guid=d48de680-85be-482e-b403-be3885717050">took me to
task</a>
for pointing out that Alan Kay ended his Turing Lecture with a product
demo. Brant makes good points and I agree with all him. I think all the
‘softies blogging OOPSLA have acknowledged how poorly this went and I
certainly didn’t mean to imply that somehow we were vindicated by Alan’s
demoing stuff in his lecture. I plan on giving Squeak a deep look when I
get some free time – I have an 18 month old son so Alan’s lecture on
teaching computer science resonated with me.</p>
