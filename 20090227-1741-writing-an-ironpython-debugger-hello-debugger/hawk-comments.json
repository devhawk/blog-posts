    "content": "Harry,\n\nVery cool. One question: I called this by writing a .bat file as follows:\n\ncd ... -- (the place I installed the git-downloaded files).\n\"C:IronPython 2.0.1ipy.exe\" -X:MTA ipydbg.py samplessimpletest.py\n\nWhen I run the .bat file from VS 2008 Command Prompt window,\nit stops at a prompt \"ipydbg>>\" from which I was able to hit 'o' to step out, in order to get the rest of the output.\n\nIt was cool to find myself in a place where I could enter commands, but if I want it to run straight thru, what do I need to change?\n\nThanks for your useful posts,\nSteve",
