-   My friend (and hopefully my next representative) [Darcy
    Burner](http://www.darcyburner.com/) is leading a group of
    congressional challengers in publishing [A Responsible Plan To End
    The War In Iraq](http://www.responsibleplan.com/plan). I haven’t
    read the plan itself in detail, but I sure like what I’m hearing
    about it.
-   Speaking of politics, Obama’s speech today “[A More Perfect
    Union](http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/samgrahamfelsen/gGBbJv)”
    was fantastic.
-   [Bioshock](http://www.xbox.com/games/bioshock/) is [getting a
    sequel](http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/15924/BioShock-Sequel-Announced-Coming-Next-Year/).
    ’nuff said.
-   There’s a [new
    version](https://www.foldershare.com/clientdownload.aspx) of
    [FolderShare
    out](http://foldershareteam.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!9D186A323DE6761!133.entry)
    and I’ve got mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, I’ve been a
    regular user of FolderShare for a while so it’s nice to see it get a
    face lift. On the other hand, it’s been over two years since
    Microsoft bought FolderShare and we’re only just now getting a new
    version, which is literally nothing more that a face lift – this
    version introduces no new functionality at all.
-   I was hoping to geek out vicariously via someone else’s hacking
    around with [Singularity](http://www.codeplex.com/singularity/).
    Luckily, Matthew Podwysocki
    [provides](http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/03/11/singularity-c-os-released-on-codeplex.aspx)
    just such an opportunity.
-   Looks like “[Prism](http://www.codeplex.com/prism)” is the new CAB.
    Glenn Block has two extensive posts covering a [project
    overview](http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2008/03/12/prism-launches-on-codeplex.aspx)
    and their [first
    drop](http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2008/03/12/prism-ri-first-drop.aspx).
    I think it’s interesting that the Prism team is focused on building
    a reference implementation, and letting the framework eventually
    fall out. Reading thru the description, it sounds awesome. However,
    based on the massive increase of inbox throughput I’m experiencing
    since I *accepted* the new job, I can’t imagine I’ll have time to
    play with it. Maybe Matthew will start playing with Prism too! (via
    [Sam
    Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2008/03/12/new-and-notable-225.aspx)
    – btw, thanks for the kind words on the new job Sam!)
-   Speaking of Sam, he points to a series by Bob Beauchemin entitled
    [LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework: Panacea or evil
    incarnate?](http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/bobb/2008/02/14/MHOLINQToSQLAndEntityFrameworkPanaceaOrEvilIncarnatePart1.aspx)
    With a title like that, who can resist reading the whole series?
    Err, I can because LINQ 2 SQL & EF performance just fell off my
    radar entirely. However I gotta agree with Sam’s point that he
    “can’t think of anyone more qualified than Bob” to tackle these
    questions.
-   Tomas Restrepo blogs his [dev environment PS
    script](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2008/03/13/DevEnvironmentForPowerShell.aspx)
    as well as a [PS fortune
    script](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2008/03/17/PowerShellFortune.aspx).
    Personally, I use Chris Tavares’ [vsvars wrapper for
    PS](http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/post.aspx?id=0ccbfc67-fc1b-496b-b71e-a74301e583de),
    though I’ll gladly take an [“official” PS based dev
    environment](http://blogs.msdn.com/nandal/archive/2008/03/10/influence-the-future-of-windows-sdk-powershell-based-build-environment.aspx).
-   I wonder if Ted Neward will get jumped for [admiring
    Mort](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/03/15/Mort+Means+Productivity.aspx)
    the way [Nick Malik
    did](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/19/not-crazy-just-lateral-thinking.aspx).
    Given that Ted called himself Mort while Nick compared Mort to agile
    developers, I’m guess Ted will have to go back to his [Vietnam
    analogy](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx)
    if he wants to create controversy.
-   Speaking of Ted, I agree [with his
    point](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/03/15/The+Reason+For+Conferences.aspx)
    that conferences are about people. As a python pre-newbie (I figure
    I’ll reach full newbie status by the time I actually start my new
    job), I spent most of my PyCon time connecting with people rather
    than trying to learn technical stuff. Also, I love Ted’s WHISCEY
    acronym.
-   Speaking of PyCon, my soon-to-be new teammate Srivatsn Narayanan
    blogs [his thoughts on
    PyCon](http://blogs.msdn.com/srivatsn/archive/2008/03/18/pycon-2008.aspx).
    I’ll try and get to my PyCon thoughts soon.
