For those of you who read this blog primarily via my RSS feed, I made a
change to my homepage over the weekend. Goodbye adSense, hello [The
Lounge](http://theloungenet.com/). [The Lounge](http://theloungenet.com)
is an ad network run by [James Avery’s](http://infozerk.com/averyblog/)
company [InfoZerk](http://infozerk.com/). I’ve known James for a while –
he included my now-obsolete [SccSwitch
tool](http://devhawk.net/2003/07/03/SccSwitch.aspx) in his book [Visual
Studio
Hacks](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Studio-Hacks-Tools-Turbocharging/dp/0596008473/).

From a financial perspective, I’m not really sure how much of a
difference this will make. I guess I’ll see when I get my first check.
Given how little I was making with adSense, I’ve got nowhere to go but
up. Regardless, I feel much better working with a smaller ad network run
by someone I respect and that is focused on the .NET platform.

Thanks for having me in the Lounge ad network, James.
