Apparently Napster to Go is old news, having been launched in beta
months ago. They don’t appear to be marketing it – the only mention of
it I could find was on the page of [compatible
devices](http://www.napster.com/compatible_devices/). I’m guessing the
reason is the page only lists five devices compatible with the Napster
to Go service and all of them are portable media centers. I wanted to
search for other devices compatible with Windows Media Digital Rights
Management 10 but the PlaysForSure advance search isn’t working. There’s
new firmware for the [Zen
Micro](http://www.nomadworld.com/downloads/firmware/wma-getfw.asp?nProdID=556&sProd=Creative%20Zen%20Micro) that
supports WMDRM 10, but nothing yet for the Zen Xtra. On the plus side, I
discovered the [Nomad
SDK](http://developer.creative.com/articles/article.asp?cat=3&sbcat=38&top=53&aid=71)
and [FriendlyNomad](http://sourceforge.net/projects/friendlynomad) C\#
wrapper for the SDK. Not sure what I would write that accessed my Nomad
– I which I could customize the playback experience but Red Chair
Software’s [Notmad
Explorer](http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/) provides a great PC
expereince.
