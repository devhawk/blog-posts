I got my new [Tablet
PC](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/tabletpc/default.asp) today – the
[Toshiba Portege
3500](http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/pc/pc_tabletPcDetail.jsp).
Seems that’s the tablet of choice inside Microsoft. I like it because
it’s got 1GB of RAM and a nifty place to hold a full size pen. My
previous Tablet was a beta unit – I was a tablet champ so I had one 6
months before they launch. That was great before they were generally
available, but as it had only 256 MB of RAM, it’s not like I could use
it for coding. With a GB of RAM, I can run [write
code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/) in the host talking to a
[web/app
server](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx) in a
virtual PC.
