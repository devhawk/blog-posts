<p>So the Metropolis session went very well, even though it was being translated. We did what is called interactive translation &#8211; where I say a few sentences in English and then Quanzhan translated it into Chinese. It meant that we couldn&#8217;t cover as much material but we still made really good time &#8211; I did 52 slides (which is a significant reduction from the full 75 slides) in exactly an hour. The audience understood at least some of what I was saying &#8211; they laughed when I made a joke &#8211; but it really helped me to have the time to think about my next sentence while Quanzhan translated my last one. I was able to choose my words carefully in order to make sure the topics were covered as concisely as possible. I&#8217;m hoping the Data in SOA talk goes as well tomorrow. After I finish this entry, I have to working on cutting that presentation down to fit in an hour with translation.</p>
<p>After my presentation, I spent some time with an architect from China Mobile. I love conversations where a customer challenges me to codify my thinking &#8211; I learn from the customer as well as myself. He made a great point about architecting for an unknown future vs. engineering for the present. Sounds like a strong believer in <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt">YAGNI</a>. While we were discussing SOA I was able to articulate something I knew but had never really expressed before. SOA is a means to an end, it&#8217;s not an end in and of itself. It&#8217;s a great way, but not the only way, to enable the flow of information across disparate systems. It&#8217;s also a great way, but not the only way, to enable more flexibility in the way we build systems. A key success metric for companies today is time-to-market. However, time-to-market usually refers to the time it takes to develop something the first time. In the future, I think the time-to-adapt will become even more important than time-to-market. Flexibility &#8211; you <i>are</i> gonna need it.</p>
