  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Actually, I just bought the same type of accessories from eBay for my Motorola T721, and they were really good. The shipping is a total rip-off, true (they charge you S/H per item and then actually ship them together! Very lame.), but I was happy with everything overall. Quick service and great products.

I don't think I used PhoneStations specifically, but one of the many other little vendors that make their livings off of eBay.

FWIW, I would do it again. And, it's cheaper then going down to your local mobile shop and buying them.


Later Harry!
