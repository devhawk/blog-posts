<p>I got my twin V300&#8242;s tonight. No sweat &#8211; only issue was figuring out which one was mine and which one was <a href="http://techiewife.com/">Julie&#8217;s</a> (We don&#8217;t have exactly the same plans). Of course, they look identical. We&#8217;ve set the backgrounds to different images so we can tell by opening the phone who&#8217;s it is, but it would be really nice to have a different faceplate for at least one of them. Plus we need 2 car chargers and I&#8217;d like to get a data cable to sync my contact list. <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a> has a bunch of vendors like <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/PhoneStations">PhoneStations</a> that offer these accessories cheap &#8211; <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=35189&item=3065020134">car charger</a> for 99 cents, <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=35215&item=5701226071">faceplate</a> for $2.97, <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=35209&item=3088661486">data cable</a> for $14.99. S&amp;H is a little outragous &#8211; $15 for four items &#8211; but $35 total including S&amp;H seems way reasonable, esp. when T-Mobile <a href="http://www.tmobile.com/products/accessories/list.asp?phoneid=201260&devicename=Motorola%20V300">charges</a> $35 for just the data cable. Anyone know anything about places to buy V300 accessories? What about applications for the V300? The data cable doesn&#8217;t come w/ any software. I found <a href="http://motocoder.com/">MotoCoder</a>, but I don&#8217;t really have time to write my own apps for this phone (esp. in J2ME).</p>
