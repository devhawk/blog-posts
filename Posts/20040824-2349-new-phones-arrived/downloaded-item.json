No sweat &#8211; only issue was figuring out which one was mine and which one was <a href=\"http:\/\/techiewife.com\/\">Julie&#8217;s<\/a> (We don&#8217;t have exactly the same plans). Of course, they look identical. We&#8217;ve set the backgrounds to different images so we can tell by opening the phone who&#8217;s it is, but it would be really nice to have a different faceplate for at least one of them. Plus we need 2 car chargers and I&#8217;d like to get a data cable to sync my contact list. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ebay.com\/\">Ebay<\/a> has a bunch of vendors like <a href=\"http:\/\/stores.ebay.com\/PhoneStations\">PhoneStations<\/a> that offer these accessories cheap &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/cgi.ebay.com\/ws\/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=35189&amp;item=3065020134\">car charger<\/a> for 99 cents, <a href=\"http:\/\/cgi.ebay.com\/ws\/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=35215&amp;item=5701226071\">faceplate<\/a> for $2.97, <a href=\"http:\/\/cgi.ebay.com\/ws\/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=35209&amp;item=3088661486\">data cable<\/a> for $14.99. S&amp;H is a little outragous &#8211; $15 for four items &#8211; but $35 total including S&amp;H seems way reasonable, esp. when T-Mobile <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tmobile.com\/products\/accessories\/list.asp?phoneid=201260&amp;devicename=Motorola%20V300\">charges<\/a> $35 for just the data cable. Anyone know anything about places to buy V300 accessories? What about applications for the V300? The data cable doesn&#8217;t come w\/ any software. I found <a href=\"http:\/\/motocoder.com\/\">MotoCoder<\/a>, but I don&#8217;t really have time to write my own apps for this phone (esp. in J2ME).<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I got my twin V300&#8242;s tonight.
