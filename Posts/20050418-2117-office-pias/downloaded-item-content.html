<p>Not that I do a bunch of Office development, but I did build a <a href="http://devhawk.net/Build+Slide+Export+.aspx">pretty nifty utility</a> for PowerPoint a while back. Getting it installed on anyone elses machine, however, was a pain in the ass because while I always remember to install the Office Primary Interop Assemblies when I install Office, I&#8217;m fairly certain I&#8217;m in the minorty on doing so. So installing Build Slide Exporter was alway tricky. Now, the Office PIA&#8217;s are available as a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=3c9a983a-ac14-4125-8ba0-d36d67e0f4ad&displaylang=en">seperate install</a>. Not sure if you can redist them, but the readme file that comes with the installer specifically mentions &#8220;Wrap the O2003pia.msi in another setup package through Visual Studio or other Windows Installer aware setup editor&#8221; so it sounds like they expect it to be redistributed.</p>
