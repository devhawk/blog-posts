<li>Morning Coffee was canceled on Thursday and Friday on account of a kidney stone. So not fun. Luckily, it was a little one and it was alone, but I will be listening very closely to my doctor&#8217;s advice to avoid another. </li>
<li>Took the kids to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/">Ratatouille</a> last Tuesday and saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/">Transformers</a> yesterday with my wife due to fluke babysitter luck. I liked Ratatouille, but I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?tt0382932">51st best movie</a> of all time. On the other hand, major props for making a kid movie with a significant lack of toy tie-ins. Ratatouille is a better movie that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/">Cars</a>, but I don&#8217;t see my four year old boy trading in is Lightning McQueen toy car for a Remy the Rat. Transformers on the other hand obviously did not forgo the toy tie-ins! Still, it wasn&#8217;t bad. Kinda reminded me of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/">The Rock</a> with a bigger budget. </li>
<li>Micahville listed DevHawk on it&#8217;s list of <a href="http://www.micahville.com/2007/07/08/69-tech-blogs-that-dont-suck/">69 Tech Blogs That Don&#8217;t Suck</a>. Thanks!</li>
<li>David Ing <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=429b79ef-21ca-4523-be81-33b15fed7e5e">boldly writes</a> that C# is getting fat. Or maybe it&#8217;s just big-boned. My take: no question that integrated query is a big feature that covers a lot of surface area. But given the prevalence of databases and other queriable stores, it&#8217;s critical to improving programmer productivity. Go read <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~toddpro/">Todd Proebsting&#8217;s</a> talk on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/papers/disruptive.ppt">Disruptive Programming Language Technologies</a>. Two of his candidates for disruptive language technologies were Database Integration and Manipulating XML. LINQ neatly covers both.</li>
<li><a href="http://connectedsystems.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!10E0A1CD60CAE1A9!265.entry">According to John Shewchuck</a>, the new BizTalk Services release is available. However, when I click on the &#8220;<a href="http://labs.biztalk.net/WhatsNew.aspx">what&#8217;s new</a>&#8221; page, it tells me they&#8217;re experiencing technical difficulties. (Their error page is Oops.aspx. Funny!)</li>

Who are you? I thought I was and &#8220;Order n&#8221; Architect (the quote &#8220;Where&#8217;s the whiteboard&#8221; is spot on) but my CS background isn&#8217;t as strong as the persona&#8217;s.</li>
