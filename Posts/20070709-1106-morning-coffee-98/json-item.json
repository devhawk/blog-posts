I liked Ratatouille, but I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/chart\/top?tt0382932\">51st best movie<\/a> of all time. On the other hand, major props for making a kid movie with a significant lack of toy tie-ins. Ratatouille is a better movie that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0317219\/\">Cars<\/a>, but I don&#8217;t see my four year old boy trading in is Lightning McQueen toy car for a Remy the Rat. Transformers on the other hand obviously did not forgo the toy tie-ins! Still, it wasn&#8217;t bad. Kinda reminded me of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0117500\/\">The Rock<\/a> with a bigger budget. <\/li>\n<li>Micahville listed DevHawk on it&#8217;s list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.micahville.com\/2007\/07\/08\/69-tech-blogs-that-dont-suck\/\">69 Tech Blogs That Don\u2019t Suck<\/a>.

Or maybe it&#8217;s just big-boned. My take: no question that integrated query is a big feature that covers a lot of surface area. But given the prevalence of databases and other queriable stores, it&#8217;s critical to improving programmer productivity. Go read <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/~toddpro\/\">Todd Proebsting&#8217;s<\/a> talk on <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/papers\/disruptive.ppt\">Disruptive Programming Language Technologies<\/a>. Two of his candidates for disruptive language technologies were Database Integration and Manipulating XML. LINQ neatly covers both.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/connectedsystems.spaces.live.com\/Blog\/cns!10E0A1CD60CAE1A9!265.entry\">According to John Shewchuck<\/a>, the new BizTalk Services release is available.
