Right before I went on vacation a few weeks ago, the power connector on my laptop started acting up. I&#8217;d plug it in, but it wouldn&#8217;t charge. Typically, replugging it would solve the issue. When I got back from vacation, the help desk tech took one look at it and realized I needed a new power connector. OK, how long will that take? Supposedly a day or two, but in the end it took a week and a half. It arrived Monday afternoon, right after I left for a two day <a href=\"http:\/\/www.soasystems.com\/events151.asp\">SOA workshop<\/a> (more on that later). To make matters worse, the power connector has now completely broken off, so I&#8217;m having to lug my docking station around if I want to charge my laptop.<\/p>\n<p>Then, to make matters worse, my power cable had stopped working. Luckily, my buddy <a href=\"http:\/\/halfmybrain.spaces.live.com\">Dale<\/a> is up here in Vancouver with me at this workshop, so I&#8217;ve been able to borrow his. But seriously, a broken power cable? How does that happen? I mean, it&#8217;s not cut or anything. But if you share the transformer box, you can hear something broken inside rattling. That&#8217;s not good.<\/p>\n<p>So I have a busted power cable that I can&#8217;t connect to my laptop anyway because of a broken power connector. Frankly, I&#8217;m a little worried about what will go wrong with this machine next. But since it only seems to happen when I&#8217;m on the road, and I&#8217;m not scheduled to go on the road again anytime soon, I guess I&#8217;ll survive.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I guess being &#8220;Harry&#8217;s Computer&#8221; is a rough gig.
