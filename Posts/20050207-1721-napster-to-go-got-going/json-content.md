With their Super Bowl ad yesterday, I guess [Napster to
Go](http://www.napster.com/ntg.html) is out of the closet. They have
some new [compatible
devices](http://www.napster.com/compatible_devices/index.html),
including the iriver H10 that [Jeff likes so
much](http://www.jeffsandquist.com/PermaLink,guid,bd338238-378e-4b28-b026-44cb2e931196.aspx).
Alas, my Nomad Zen Xtra is still out in the cold. So far, it looks like
only portable media centers and a handful of 5GB players (the H10, Nomad
Zen Micro, Dell Pocket DJ, Gateway Photo Jukebox) are supported.

I’m wondering if older devices will ever be supported? I mean, it’s a
new protocol and technology, I wouldn’t be super suprised if the older
devices just couldn’t be upgraded to support the subscription service.
But if that’s the case, I wish they would simply announce it and move on
rather than leaving it in limbo. [This
post](http://uk.europe.creative.com/support/forums/thread.asp?thre=53365)
on the Creative Europe forum makes it sounds like the firmware will get
upgraded, but with no idea of a date. So, in other words, I don’t know
when or if I’ll get to use Napster to Go to fill up the other half of my
40GB Zen.
