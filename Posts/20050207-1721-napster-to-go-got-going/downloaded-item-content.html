<p>With their Super Bowl ad yesterday, I guess <a href="http://www.napster.com/ntg.html">Napster to Go</a> is out of the closet. They have some new <a href="http://www.napster.com/compatible_devices/index.html">compatible devices</a>, including the iriver H10 that <a href="http://www.jeffsandquist.com/PermaLink,guid,bd338238-378e-4b28-b026-44cb2e931196.aspx">Jeff likes so much</a>. Alas, my Nomad Zen Xtra is still out in the cold. So far, it looks like only portable media centers and a handful of 5GB players (the H10, Nomad Zen Micro, Dell Pocket DJ, Gateway Photo Jukebox) are supported. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering if older devices will ever be supported? I mean, it&#8217;s a new protocol and technology, I wouldn&#8217;t be super suprised if the older devices just couldn&#8217;t be upgraded to support the subscription service. But if that&#8217;s the case, I wish they would simply announce it and move on rather than leaving it in limbo. <a href="http://uk.europe.creative.com/support/forums/thread.asp?thre=53365">This post</a> on the Creative Europe forum makes it sounds like the firmware will get upgraded, but with no idea of a date. So, in other words, I don&#8217;t know when or if I&#8217;ll get to use Napster to Go to fill up the other half of my 40GB Zen.</p>
