  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For what it's worth, I don't think the lack of tracks is particularly important. Anyone playing back these things has a player with the possibility to change what part of the file it is playing and a timer to let you get this approximately right.

I DO think that providing this as a .wma file that can be burnt onto a CDROM is a really good idea. I am quite sick of all the useful web casts that I have be connected to the web in order to be able to watch them.

(Yes, I do have broadband at home; yes, I have wireless as well to it; but no, my parents don't have broadband and no, I don't want to pay airport charges to connect up (and those are the places I would have most time to watch these things))]]></wp:comment_content>
