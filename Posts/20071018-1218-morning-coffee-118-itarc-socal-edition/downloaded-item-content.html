<p>I&#8217;m not back on blog sabbatical, but between finishing my presentation and attending <a href="http://www.iasahome.org/web/itarc/socal">ITARC SoCal</a> earlier this week &#8211; not to mention being sick &#8211; I didn&#8217;t have time to write anything. Normal Morning Coffee resumes tomorrow, here&#8217;s a summary of my notes from on my two days at ITARC.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ambysoft.com/">Scott Ambler</a> did the opening keynote on agile enterprise architecture strategy. </li>
<ul>
<li>He claims that success is more prevalent in the industry that people think, because the industry has a narrow definition of success. If you change (aka widen) the definition, the success rate goes way up! That&#8217;s not exactly useful, but he referred to an as-yet-unpublished survey on project success rate that should be up on DDJ &#8220;soon&#8221;. I&#8217;d like to see that raw data.</li>
<li>While I agree with most of his points, Scott&#8217;s presentation style is very abrasive. For example, he makes the point that there is no one-size-fits-all process, which I couldn&#8217;t agree with more. But does he say it like that? No, he says &#8220;Repeatable processes? What an incredibly stupid idea!&#8221; even though the room is full of folks who probably think repeatable process is actually a good idea. </li>
<li>Scott suggested that unit tests are the best way to specify requirements. I&#8217;ve heard this before from agile practitioners, but something nags at me about it. Certainly, having executable requirements is a huge plus. But how can you be sure they&#8217;re the right requirements if the stakeholders can&#8217;t read them?</li>
<li>This keynote setup what turned out to be a major theme for the conference &#8211; traditional vs. non-traditional enterprise architecture. Or as I would characterize it: Industrial vs. Post Industrial architecture. </li>
</ul>
<li><a href="http://simonguest.com/blogs/smguest/default.aspx">Simon Guest</a> presented on user experience in architecture, which is his specialty these days. He lays out a UX model that was very compelling. I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s a whitepaper version of this model (there should be) but you can see the model as he <a href="http://simonguest.com/blogs/smguest/archive/2007/06/21/Slides-from-San-Diego-UX-Summit.aspx">lays it out in powerpoint</a>. I&#8217;ve seen Simon&#8217;s UX decks, but never actually seen him present it, so that was a treat. </li>
<li>I skipped Ted Neward&#8217;s session in order to take in something new. So I went to see <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/turbogeek/">Daniel Brookshier</a> of <a href="http://www.nomagic.com/">No Magic</a> talk about DoDAF &#8211; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DODAF">Dept. of Defense Architecture Framework</a>. I had met Daniel the night before at dinner and while No Magic primarily sells <a href="http://www.nomagic.com/text.php?lang=2&item=232&arg=206">UML modeling tools</a>, we seemed to agree that UML is most useful (in my opinion &#8220;at all useful&#8221;) when you imbue the vanilla models with custom semantics &#8211; aka you turn them into a DSL. So while I liked hanging out with Daniel, his DoDAF session did nothing except ensure I never work for the DoD. There&#8217;s no amount of money that&#8217;s worth dealing with the two dozen or so bureaucratic models that are all wholly isolated from anything that actually executes. Daniel kept saying how easy these models are to build. I&#8217;m sure they are, but that&#8217;s not the problem. Since they&#8217;re not an intrinsic part of a construction process, they won&#8217;t stay up to date. This was a very industrial approach &#8211; Daniel even stated at one point that he was &#8220;anti-Ambler&#8221;. </li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/davidchappell/">David Chappell</a> did the second keynote on grid-enabled SOA.</li>
<ul>
<li>When did David join Oracle? I guess I haven&#8217;t been paying much attention to competitors since I moved to MSIT.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.soamag.com/I10/0907-1.asp">article version</a> of this presentation available, but I haven&#8217;t read it yet.</li>
<li>For me, the best part of this presentation was him acknowledging that there&#8217;s a need for non-stateless services, something he has <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/davidchappell/2007/09/27#a22">blogged about recently</a>. I&#8217;m not sure I agree with his framework for stateful interaction, but at least he&#8217;s admitting that it&#8217;s needed. Now if I could only convince the Connected Systems Division&#8230;</li>
<li>The rest of his talk was basically a sales pitch for the Coherence product Oracle recently bought. Basically, it&#8217;s a huge, multi-node, redundant, in-memory database. While I&#8217;m sure there are a few high-end problems out there &#8211; my immediate thought was travel and David mentioned <a href="http://www.sabretravelnetwork.com/">SABRE</a> is one of their customers &#8211; this is not a good general purpose solution, though David was positioning it as such.</li>
</ul>
<li>My talk on &#8220;Moving Beyond Industrial Software&#8221; was after the second keynote. It was good, if sparsely attended. I&#8217;m doing it again @ the <a href="http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2007.aspx">p&amp;p Summit</a> so I&#8217;ll post the slides and hopefully a recording after that.</li>
<li>I skipped the last session of the day to decompress, so the next session I went to was the day two opening keynote by <a href="http://www.omg.org/news/about/contacts.htm#tek">Fred Waskiewicz</a>, OMG&#8217;s Director of Standards. His talk, unsurprisingly, was on the value of standards &#8211; in particular, OMG&#8217;s standards. This was about as anti-Ambler, anti-agile, pro-industrial a presentation as you could make. I&#8217;d heard this spiel before, so I mostly tuned out. I did challenge Fred on his point that the UML models are at a higher level of abstraction than code. They&#8217;re not &#8211; they&#8217;re a visualization and they&#8217;re very useful, but they&#8217;re at the exact same level of abstraction as code. That&#8217;s why you can automatically generate the visualization in tools like Visual Studio&#8217;s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/tour/vs2005_guided_tour/VS2005pro/Smart_Client/ClassDesign.htm">class designer</a>. Fred didn&#8217;t have much of a response to my question, though he did point out that some models like Business Process Models are, in fact, higher levels of abstraction. </li>
<li>Next was what I thought was the best presentation of the entire show, IASA Founder <a href="http://www.iasahome.org/web/home/about/leadership">Paul Preiss</a> on what architects need to know. Note, I&#8217;m not brown-nosing Paul here &#8211; I&#8217;m the guy that first decided to commit Microsoft as an <a href="http://www.iasahome.org/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PUB.1.159">IASA sponsor</a>, so he has to like me even if I thought his session was crap. Paul talked about architect as a career, comparing it to doctors. He worries that he&#8217;s over-using that analogy, but software architect has much more in common career wise than it does with building architects IMO. I wonder where one might do their architecture residency? He also thinks of architects as &#8220;living governance&#8221;, saying that project managers answer to the stakeholders while architects are beholden to the stockholders. I like that approach to governance.</li>
<li>Finally, I attended Vince Casarez&#8217;s session on Web 2.0 in the enterprise. Vince is an Oracle VP and this turned into a sales pitch like David Chappell&#8217;s keynote did. I&#8217;m not sure what product it was, but it reminded me of QEDWiki from IBM that I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/08/Rod+Smith+On+Do+It+Yourself+IT.aspx">saw at ETech last year</a>, which isn&#8217;t a complement. If you&#8217;re going to build an enterprise mashup designer, is it just me or is &#8220;lots of code spew&#8221; a poor model. Why not go for something like <a href="http://www.popfly.ms/">Popfly</a> or <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Pipes</a>? </li>
<li>I left early the second day in order to get home before my kids went to sleep (which I failed at due to lack of naptime). Overall, the conference was pretty good, though a bit sparsely attended in part I think because they held it in San Diego. The Orange Country IASA user group is very popular, so I don&#8217;t understand why they didn&#8217;t just hold it around there somewhere. Live and learn, I guess. They did have to postpone the DC event until next year sometime. Here&#8217;s hoping I get invited to that as well as well as ITARC SoCal &#8217;08 (note, that *is* brown-nosing a bit)</li>
</ul>
