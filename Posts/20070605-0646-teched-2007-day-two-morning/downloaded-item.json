Drew a fairly good sized audience &#8211; people were sitting on the floor and standing in the back, though honestly the TLC &#8220;theaters&#8221; only hold about 50 chairs. Most of them stayed the for whole session &#8211; at least until I started to run over (only 15 minutes, not too bad). <\/p>\n<p>After my session, I ended up talking to a customer from a large home loan firm for about two hours. Turns out we had a friend in common,\u00a0a guy I used to work with a long time ago @ ModaCad named Brian. This is actually the second time I&#8217;ve run into someone at a major Microsoft conference who has a single degree of Brian, which is a little freaky.<\/p>\n<p>For dinner, I went out with some MS field architects and some customers. We ended up having such a big group, we split up into two tables and somehow my table had four MS employees and only one customer. But that customer was from a very large retail firm and we had lots to talk about. Ate way too much, though I didn&#8217;t combine that with drinking too much. And, as a bonus, I didn&#8217;t tell the customer than any of their ideas were &#8220;stupid&#8221;, as my friend <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/cschittko\/\">Christoph<\/a> pointed out I had done the <em>last<\/em> time I was out to dinner with one of his customers. (That customer wanted to run Java on their mainframe. I stand by my assessment.)<\/p>\n<p>I was <em>planning<\/em> to head up to my room, but ran into <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masteringbiztalk.com\/blogs\/jon\/\">Jon Flanders<\/a> in the lobby. Hadn&#8217;t seen Jon since the class I took with him last fall, so I ended up hanging out with him for several hours, chatting up the folks we knew who walked by, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lhotka.net\/\">Rocky<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sqlskills.com\/blogs\/bobb\/\">Bob<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mcwtech.com\/CS\/blogs\/brianr\/\">Brian<\/a>. I realized I&#8217;ve been heads down with no speaking or travel for about a year, so it&#8217;s been a while since I had seen many of these folks. For example, I hadn&#8217;t seen Brian in about three years when we were both presenting at TechEd New Zealand. The downside of hanging out in the lobby is that I didn&#8217;t get any code written last night, which I was sort of planning to do when I headed back to the hotel. But chatting with these folks &#8211; esp. Jon this time &#8211; helps be figure out <em>what<\/em> I want to write anyway, so I guess it&#8217;s worth it! <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group978\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>I ended up sleeping in this morning (still jet lagged) and skipping the morning session. No second keynote this year, which I didn&#8217;t realize until I looked at the conf guide this morning. Not sure if that&#8217;s a good thing or a bad thing. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>My session yesterday went very well, especially considering I did no prep whatsoever.
