<p>I got an email this morning from <a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~rxv/so/soapbox.htm">Richard Veryard</a> wondering if I should now be called EdgeHawk. That&#8217;s funny. Alas, <a href="http://www.edgehawk.com/">EdgeHawk.com</a> is &#8220;Your #1 internet Hoosier Racing Tire source&#8221; so I think I&#8217;m going to stick with DevHawk&#8230;at least for now.</p>
