I got an email this morning from [Richard
Veryard](http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~rxv/so/soapbox.htm) wondering
if I should now be called EdgeHawk. That’s funny. Alas,
[EdgeHawk.com](http://www.edgehawk.com/) is “Your \#1 internet Hoosier
Racing Tire source” so I think I’m going to stick with DevHawk…at least
for now.
