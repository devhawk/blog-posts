<p>Last week, after I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/10/11/More+Stuff+I+Didnt+Know+About+WF.aspx">posting my WF learnings</a>, I got a call from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2006/10/16/Ten-Reasons-why-WF-is-not-a-Toy.aspx">Paul Andrew</a>, Technical Product Manager for WF. Seems calling the built-in persistence service and the built-in web service support &#8220;toys&#8221; created some extra work for Paul. He <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2006/10/16/Ten-Reasons-why-WF-is-not-a-Toy.aspx">blogged a response</a> and I wanted to follow up on a few things here.</p>
<p>1. The &#8220;toy&#8221; SQL Persistence Service &#8211; My understanding about how the built-in persistence service works was incorrect. As per Paul&#8217;s blog, &#8220;The WF runtime doesn&#8217;t load all idle instances on startup, that would be crazy.&#8221; Of course, we&#8217;re talking about the SQL Persistence Service, not the WF runtime, but it&#8217;s still crazy. It&#8217;s so crazy that when I thought that&#8217;s what the SQL Persistence Service did, I called it a toy! So I&#8217;m flat out wrong on this one. Sorry about that Paul (and the rest of the WF team).</p>
<p>2. The &#8220;toy&#8221; Web Service Integration &#8211; Apparently, I was also mistaken about the use of ASP.NET sessions. But I was right about WF&#8217;s use of ASMX, the use of the tempuri.org namespace, and that web service support is limited to WS-I basic profile request/response&nbsp;style services. So while &#8220;toy&#8221; is a bit harsh, the web service integration is still pretty light weight. Where&#8217;s the WCF integration? I understand the need to support ASMX, but no WCF means no support for duplex conversations, either as service provider or consumer, and no support for reliable sessions. That makes WF&#8217;s web service integration a non-starter in my project.&nbsp;Of course, the good news is that you can build your own WF activities, so I can toss the built-in web&nbsp; service activites and still get to keep the rest of WF.</p>
<p>3. Is WF itself a &#8220;toy&#8221;? Paul has a list of reasons why WF isn&#8217;t a toy, including some silly ones (it wasn&#8217;t in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/">Toy Story</a>). In case there&#8217;s any confusion about my opinon of WF, let me be clear: I think WF rocks, full stop. My negative comments about WF were isolated to the two areas listed above and not intended to apply to WF as a whole. The other seven points were all about cool things that I didn&#8217;t realize WF does.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not just trying to kiss up to Paul here &#8211; WF is one of two foundation technologies that my project absolutely depends on. (Any guesses on the other?) With the class out of the way and a better understaning as to what&#8217;s possible with WF, I will be diving much deeper on WF in the future. Watch this space for more WF related posts.</p>
