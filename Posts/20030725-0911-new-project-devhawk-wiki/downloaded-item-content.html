<p>I got my latest project posted &#8211; <a href="prj_wiki.aspx">DevHawk Wiki</a>. I was hoping to have this up yesterday, but GDN wouldn&#8217;t cooperate. It&#8217;s pretty minimal right now &#8211; it&#8217;s a v0.1 release. <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/applyjoin.aspx?id=9513f6ed-41c2-4c0f-a5d6-730371bb4b45"> Collaborators welcome</a>.</p>
<p>The cool part about DevHawk Wiki is that the wiki rendering code is separated out into a separate assembly. This means you could embed it in other apps (I&#8217;m thinking about a wiki-style comment system for this blog). One of the things I had to do to make this work is keep things like the wiki file repository independent of the wiki rendering itself. I used delegates to do this, then I read <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-07-21T08:36:33Z"> Don&#8217;s recent post</a> on delegates and loose coupling. Here&#8217;s an example of what Don was talking about, in the wild.</p>
