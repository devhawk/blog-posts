-   Saturday, I participated in the Washington Democratic caucus, which
    was [handily won by
    Obama](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/350752_caucuses09.html).
    Much has been made of the record Democratic turnout in this race for
    the nomination, my local caucus location was no exception. It
    appeared that attendance outstripped expectation about 2-to-1. My
    precinct alone had 56 attendees, which went overwhelmingly for
    Obama.
-   I had never participated in a presidential caucus or primary before
    – the race has always been decided by the time it got to my state. I
    really enjoyed being a part of the process. So I’m going to play
    amateur pundit today, and we’ll be back to our regularly scheduled
    geek blogging tomorrow. If I insult your favorite party or
    candidate, please feel free to leave a scathing comment explaining
    that I’m an idiot and how you’re never going to read my blog again.
-   Obama not only won the WA caucus, he also won Louisiana, Nebraska
    and Maine over the weekend. And he didn’t just win, he won big. He
    won by 37% in WA, 36% in Nebraska, 21% in Louisiana and is leading
    by 15% in Maine with 70% of the vote counted. Momentum hasn’t meant
    much in this campaign, but five double-digit Obama wins in a row
    (with three more likely Obama wins tomorrow) can’t be good for the
    Clinton campain. Polling that shows [Obama matches up against McCain
    better than
    Clinton](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1711123,00.html?xid=rss-nation)
    doesn’t help. 
-   Speaking of McCain, he sure had a shitty day Saturday. He lost
    [Kansas](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21229207) by a whopping 36%.
    [Louisiana](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21229209) was close, but
    McCain still lost. And in Washington, it looks like the state
    Republican Party [simply stopped
    counting](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/350829_trail11.html)
    with 1500 votes still left to be counted. I’m guessing the local GOP
    party leads were trying to keep McCain from going 0-3 on the day.
    Had they simply counted the votes and McCain lost, everyone would
    have forgotten by the time he got the nomination. However, this
    little helping hand makes McCain look weak and keeps Saturday’s
    butt-kicking in the news for several more days.
-   Of course, McCain is the presumed Republican nominee because Romney
    ~~dropped out~~[suspended his presidential
    campaign](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23050678/) last week. The
    Daily Show’s [coverage Thursday
    night](http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=156317&title=mitt-drops-out)
    was hilarious. Jason Jones is right, Romney’s a real [douche
    bag](http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=156319&title=the-douche-vote).
-   Apparently, McCain is
    [“eager”](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/us/politics/10bush.html?ei=5088&en=b4ace59c7d62fbe9&ex=1360299600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print)
    for [President 30% Approval
    Rating](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jR80ylRipRFz_BSPltSUJ06-lMegD8UM1TRO0)
    to “embrace” him. Furthermore, the President [apparently
    thinks](http://thinkprogress.org/2008/02/08/bush-mccain-will-best-carry-out-my-agenda/)
    McCain would be the best to carry forth his agenda. I gotta agree
    with Steve Benen on this – “[Could Dems really be this
    lucky?](http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/14537.html)”
-   In the wake of McCain’s Super Tuesday victory, Rush Limbaugh
    [said](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0628190220080206) he and
    other right-wing talk show hosts are “trying to stop the wanton
    destruction of the [GOP] party”. Limbaugh and his cohorts aren’t
    going away, but certainly they’ve been reduced to irrelevant status,
    standing on the sidelines and stamping their feet while the
    Republican rank-and-file hand the nomination to McCain. Sure is
    hilarious to watch. Has anyone considered that Republicans are
    rooting for the wonton destruction of what their party has become?
