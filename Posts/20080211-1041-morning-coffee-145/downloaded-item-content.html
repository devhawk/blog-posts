<li>Saturday, I participated in the Washington Democratic caucus, which was <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/350752_caucuses09.html">handily won by Obama</a>. Much has been made of the record Democratic turnout in this race for the nomination, my local caucus location was no exception. It appeared that attendance outstripped expectation about 2-to-1. My precinct alone had 56 attendees, which went overwhelmingly for Obama.  </li>
<li>I had never participated in a presidential caucus or primary before &#8211; the race has always been decided by the time it got to my state. I really enjoyed being a part of the process. So I&#8217;m going to play amateur pundit today, and we&#8217;ll be back to our regularly scheduled geek blogging tomorrow. If I insult your favorite party or candidate, please feel free to leave a scathing comment explaining that I&#8217;m an idiot and how you&#8217;re never going to read my blog again.  </li>
<li>Obama not only won the WA caucus, he also won Louisiana, Nebraska and Maine over the weekend. And he didn&#8217;t just win, he won big. He won by 37% in WA, 36% in Nebraska, 21% in Louisiana and is leading by 15% in Maine with 70% of the vote counted. Momentum hasn&#8217;t meant much in this campaign, but five double-digit Obama wins in a row (with three more likely Obama wins tomorrow) can&#8217;t be good for the Clinton campain. Polling that shows <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1711123,00.html?xid=rss-nation">Obama matches up against McCain better than Clinton</a> doesn&#8217;t help.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Speaking of McCain, he sure had a shitty day Saturday. He lost <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21229207">Kansas</a> by a whopping 36%. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21229209">Louisiana</a> was close, but McCain still lost. And in Washington, it looks like the state Republican Party <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/350829_trail11.html">simply stopped counting</a> with 1500 votes still left to be counted. I&#8217;m guessing the local GOP party leads were trying to keep McCain from going 0-3 on the day. Had they simply counted the votes and McCain lost, everyone would have forgotten by the time he got the nomination. However, this little helping hand makes McCain look weak and keeps Saturday&#8217;s butt-kicking in the news for several more days.  </li>
<li>Of course, McCain is the presumed Republican nominee because Romney <strike>dropped out</strike><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23050678/">suspended his presidential campaign</a> last week. The Daily Show&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=156317&title=mitt-drops-out">coverage Thursday night</a> was hilarious. Jason Jones is right, Romney&#8217;s a real <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=156319&title=the-douche-vote">douche bag</a>.  </li>
<li>Apparently, McCain is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/us/politics/10bush.html?ei=5088&en=b4ace59c7d62fbe9&ex=1360299600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print">&#8220;eager&#8221;</a> for <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jR80ylRipRFz_BSPltSUJ06-lMegD8UM1TRO0">President 30% Approval Rating</a> to &#8220;embrace&#8221; him. Furthermore, the President <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/02/08/bush-mccain-will-best-carry-out-my-agenda/">apparently thinks</a> McCain would be the best to carry forth his agenda. I gotta agree with Steve Benen on this &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/14537.html">Could Dems really be this lucky?</a>&#8221;  </li>
<li>In the wake of McCain&#8217;s Super Tuesday victory, Rush Limbaugh <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0628190220080206">said</a> he and other right-wing talk show hosts are &#8220;trying to stop the wanton destruction of the [GOP] party&#8221;. Limbaugh and his cohorts aren&#8217;t going away, but certainly they&#8217;ve been reduced to irrelevant status, standing on the sidelines and stamping their feet while the Republican rank-and-file hand the nomination to McCain. Sure is hilarious to watch. Has anyone considered that Republicans are rooting for the wonton destruction of what their party has become?</li>
