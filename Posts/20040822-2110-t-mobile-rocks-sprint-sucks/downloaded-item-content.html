<p>A while ago, <a href="http://conpro.net/">Tom</a><a href="http://www.conpro.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=558f432f-3118-4ad2-ba50-b3476a8849b6">mentioned</a> that I had a great customer service experience with T-Mobile. Truthfully, the great customer service experience came today. T-Mobile just earned a customer for&#8230;well, maybe not for life, but they certainly have earned enough karma to keep me around a while. And at the same time, Sprint has spurned a customer for life. </p>
<p>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=75f886b0-06db-4cf1-9534-604a518841f8">blogged</a> back in April about getting a SmartPhone. Well, the honeymoon was short lived &#8211; it was a developer beta unit and it was not particularly robust. I dropped it about a month ago and it died. No huge deal, the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details/0,,53,00.html">MPx220</a> is coming soon. Of course, I need a phone in the meantime. I had signed up for T-Mobile service to power the SmartPhone so I went back to pick up a <a href="http://www.motorola.com/mdirect/hellomoto/experience/v300/flash/index.shtml">V300</a> which would go to my wife when the MPx220 became available. Only trouble was that since I hadn&#8217;t bought the phone when I activated my account, I was not eligible for an activation discount. I had asked about that when I bought the service, and had been assured it was no big deal. So I call up customer service, and they promise to wave the disconnect fee on the current account if I buy a new phone (with the activation discount). This was right before I went to New Zealand, so I figured I&#8217;d take care of it when I got back. In the meantime, I&#8217;m using a old borrowed phone and my existing account.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been back a week, but hadn&#8217;t gotten to taking care of the phone yet. Then last night, someone steals my phone and my wife&#8217;s phone out of the car. So I call T-Mobile and explain the situation. They cancel the account on the spot, outright &#8211; no early termination fee or anything. Pretty cool. Of course, I did tell them I was going to buy not one but two new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/wireless/B0000WZWSI/ref=w_zr_hp_td_blah2/002-7066890-6721622">V300&#8242;s from Amazon</a> (for the low price of -$100 each after rebate) but still, I thought that was pretty cool. The only bummer of this whole scenario is that I won&#8217;t be able to get the MPx220 with an activation discount when it comes up.</p>
<p>After talking to T-Mobile, I called Sprint. Now, I&#8217;ve been a Sprint customer for five years. You would think that would warrant a little respect and/or leeway, but apparently not. The &#8220;customer service&#8221; rep I spoke to was both rude and stupid. He was able to suspend my wife&#8217;s phone, but when I asked to cancel it he told me there would be an early termination fee. Funny thing is, the term on this &#8220;contract&#8221; (which I never signed and was unaware of) end&#8217;s on the 28th of August. You know, next Saturday. As in, six days from today. You would think that you might give a customer of five years who is dealing with a case of theft the benefit of the doubt and wave the early termination fee less than a week before the contract expires anyway. No, apparently I have to call back Saturday to terminate the contract. Fine. I set a reminder on my calendar so I don&#8217;t forget to rid myself of Sprint for good and forever. </p>
