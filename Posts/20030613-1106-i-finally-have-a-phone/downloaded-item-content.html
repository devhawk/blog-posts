<p>It&#8217;s not my final phone. It&#8217;s a loaner since my wireless provider couldn&#8217;t seem to process the order for my replacement phone due to &#8220;server issues&#8221;. I have to return this one next week when my &#8220;real&#8221; phone arrives. But, hey, at least I can make a phone call from my car in the meantime.</p>
