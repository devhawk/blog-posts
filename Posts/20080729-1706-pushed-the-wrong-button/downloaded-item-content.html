<p>I&#8217;m working on a new series of posts on parser monads, but I accidentally pushed out part thre (I hit &#8220;Publish&#8221; instead of &#8220;New&#8221; in WL Writer). I can&#8217;t stop you from reading it, as it&#8217;s already in Google and FeedBurner&#8217;s cache. However, if you want any context at all, do yourself a favor and wait until I publish parts one and two first!</p>
