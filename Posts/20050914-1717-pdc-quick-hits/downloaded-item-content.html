<p>I&#8217;m sure lots of people are blogging a ton about PDC stuff, but I wanted to call out two things quickly.</p>
<p>First is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/max/">Microsoft Max</a>. I have a friend on this team, so I&#8217;ve heard a bunch about this. Given the number of pictures I have taken of my kids, I can&#8217;t wait to play with this in earnest.</p>
<p>Second is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/default.aspx">LINQ</a> or Language Integrated Query and it&#8217;s use in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/future/">C# 3.0</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/future">VB 9.0</a>. I started to write a language a few years ago called Dart (named after my dog) that had SQL-esque commands that were strongly typed. So I&#8217;m really impressed with what they&#8217;ve acomplished in LINQ. Not only is it doing strongly typed queries in the lanugage, they even can do joins across stores! In the keynote demo, they joined a query of running processes with data from a database. So now any C# or VB developer has their &#8211; or should I say will have their &#8211; own query processor around at the ready!</p>
