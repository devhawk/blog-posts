<p>Christmas was crazy (my wife&#8217;s blog has the <a href="http://techiewife.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=530a1a12-1c0f-4824-aff9-09b74ccf222d">details</a>), so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to blog about Sean &amp; Scott&#8217;s desire for <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/2003/12/31.html#a538">unification of objects and data</a>, <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~emeijer/">Erik Meijer&#8217;s</a><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~gmb/Papers/vanilla-xml2003.html#S1">two</a><a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~emeijer/Papers/XS.pdf">papers</a> on the topic, or Dare&#8217;s <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6523c363-1572-46bd-8ded-abf206c06569">responses</a> to <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=755443c2-19a6-4b45-8e18-879565e74759">both</a>. Programming language evolution is something I&#8217;ve keenly interested in. When I first started this blog almost a year ago, <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=896fcfbd-dede-4c62-8f59-24aece862218">one of my early posts</a> was about a disruptive programming language technologies presentation from MS Research. Among the areas mentioned for improvement: were database integration and XML manipulation. Sounds like the Xen language <a href="http://www.xmlconference.org/xmlusa/2003/friday.asp#7">demoed @ XML 2003</a> is a step in that direction.</p>
<p>When you read Erik&#8217;s papers, you&#8217;ll notice that one of the goals is to natively integrate XML into the language. He writes: &#8220;In our approach XML documents or document fragments become first class citizens.&#8221; What&#8217;s interesting about that is that if you take XML to mean pure-infoset-data (as opposed to angle-bracket-serialization-format) then you can argue that Data (with a capital D) is not a first class citizen of today&#8217;s Object-Oriented languages. Given that a lot of OO code has been written to manipulate data, having a language that explicitly distinguished between the two could be valuable (assuming it made the programming easier and the programmer more productive). </p>
<p>Note, this is the opposite approach from tools like O/R mappers and XSD.exe which attempt to hide the differences from the programmer. We&#8217;ve seen a similar evolution in the way we think about invoking objects across the network. Tools like DCOM and .NET Remoting attempt to hide the RPC and make it appear as a local call. But as the thinking evolves, tools like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/01/Indigo/default.aspx">Indigo</a> is designed to make the boundaries across apps and machines explicit. Initial thoughts on data access were to make it all look like objects (i.e. O/R mapping). But as the thinking evolves, maybe we need to make the boundaries between objects and data explicit (and easy) as well.</p>
