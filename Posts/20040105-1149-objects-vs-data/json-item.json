Programming language evolution is something I&#8217;ve keenly interested in. When I first started this blog almost a year ago, <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=896fcfbd-dede-4c62-8f59-24aece862218\">one of my early posts<\/a> was about a disruptive programming language technologies presentation from MS Research. Among the areas mentioned for improvement: were database integration and XML manipulation. Sounds like the Xen language <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xmlconference.org\/xmlusa\/2003\/friday.asp#7\">demoed @ XML 2003<\/a> is a step in that direction.<\/p>\n<p>When you read Erik&#8217;s papers, you&#8217;ll notice that one of the goals is to natively integrate XML into the language. He writes: &#8220;In our approach XML documents or document fragments become first class citizens.&#8221; What&#8217;s interesting about that is that if you take XML to mean pure-infoset-data (as opposed to angle-bracket-serialization-format) then you can argue that Data (with a capital D) is not a first class citizen of today&#8217;s Object-Oriented languages. Given that a lot of OO code has been written to manipulate data, having a language that explicitly distinguished between the two could be valuable (assuming it made the programming easier and the programmer more productive). <\/p>\n<p>Note, this is the opposite approach from tools like O\/R mappers and XSD.exe which attempt to hide the differences from the programmer. We&#8217;ve seen a similar evolution in the way we think about invoking objects across the network. Tools like DCOM and .NET Remoting attempt to hide the RPC and make it appear as a local call. But as the thinking evolves, tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/msdnmag\/issues\/04\/01\/Indigo\/default.aspx\">Indigo<\/a> is designed to make the boundaries across apps and machines explicit. Initial thoughts on data access were to make it all look like objects (i.e. O\/R mapping). But as the thinking evolves, maybe we need to make the boundaries between objects and data explicit (and easy) as well.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Christmas was crazy (my wife&#8217;s blog has the details), so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to blog about Sean &amp; Scott&#8217;s desire for unification of objects and data, Erik Meijer&#8217;stwopapers on the topic, or Dare&#8217;s responses to both.
