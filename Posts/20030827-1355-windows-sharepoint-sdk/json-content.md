The [Windows SharePoint Services
SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=1c64af62-c2e9-4ca3-a2a0-7d4319980011&displaylang=en)
has shipped. It’s basically a help file – no bits. And no RTM version of
WSS as of yet. I guess that has to [wait until October
1st](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/getit.asp) like the rest of
the Office System.
