See you @ the PDC.

I used to live in LA
([thankfully](PermaLink.aspx?guid=87d7157e-20cc-4f40-84f4-32720a3d4a28),
that’s in my past) so I was hoping to catch an [LA
Kings](http://lakings.com/) game while I was there (esp. since the
Staples Center is right by the Convention Center). Too bad they play the
25th (the night before the conference starts) and the 30th (the night
after the conference ends). I’m pretty much boxed in on both ends so I
can’t come down early or stay late.

Are there any plans yet for blogger get-togethers in LA? Sorry I missed
the Crossroads on Wednesday, but I was out of the country.
