He&#8217;s ex-Army, so it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s out of character for him. Of course, the camo netting has the exact opposite of it&#8217;s indented effect, making Rick&#8217;s cube very easy to find in the farm. </p>
<p>Unlike my last team, most of my <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!194.entry">teammates are conservatives</a>. But apparently we can find common ground in our opinions of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld. Rick called him an abysmal failure. I couldn&#8217;t agree more. <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com">Dale</a> joked that Rumsfeld was joining our team and moving into Rick&#8217;s newly camo festooned cube. Rick countered that Rumsfeld was actually joining the Enterprise Architecture group. Heh. </p>
<p>Update: Dale <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,d205a6b9-567e-4587-85e2-c2e3a55f6659.aspx#commentstart">points out</a> he made the joke about Rumsfeld joining EA, not Rick. My bad Dale. </p>
