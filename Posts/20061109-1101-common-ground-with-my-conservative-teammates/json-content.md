I came in this morning to discover my boss and next cube neighbor
[Rick](http://rickbarn.spaces.live.com/) had decided to spruce up his
cube with camo netting. He’s ex-Army, so it’s not like it’s out of
character for him. Of course, the camo netting has the exact opposite of
it’s indented effect, making Rick’s cube very easy to find in the farm.

Unlike my last team, most of my [teammates are
conservatives](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!194.entry).
But apparently we can find common ground in our opinions of Defense
Secretary Rumsfeld. Rick called him an abysmal failure. I couldn’t agree
more. [Dale](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com) joked that Rumsfeld was
joining our team and moving into Rick’s newly camo festooned cube. Rick
countered that Rumsfeld was actually joining the Enterprise Architecture
group. Heh.

**Update**: Dale [points
out](http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,d205a6b9-567e-4587-85e2-c2e3a55f6659.aspx#commentstart)
he made the joke about Rumsfeld joining EA, not Rick. My bad Dale.
