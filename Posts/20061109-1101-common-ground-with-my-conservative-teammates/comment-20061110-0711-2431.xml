  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Years ago, I knew a couple of guys that used camo netting over their cubes.  In my opinion, it really improved the lighting and the acoustics of their cubicles.  It was fun to visit them and collaborate in their cubicles -- we could really concentrate and get stuff done under the nets.

Neither guy was ex-Military and I have no idea about their political affiliation.

A maintenance guy came by and asked one of my co-workers to take down the net.  My co-worker refused.  The maintenance guy said "It is a fire hazard!".   My co-worker then explained that the netting conformed to MilSpec#Such-and-such and is completely fireproof.  I thought he was about to demonstrate this when he whipped out the coolest cigarette lighter I ever saw!

Last I remember, the netting was still up.]]></wp:comment_content>
