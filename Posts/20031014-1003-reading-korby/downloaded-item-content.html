<p align="left">Finally got around to <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/blogxbrowsing.asmx/GetRss?"> subscribing</a> to <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp">Korby Parnell&#8217;s</a> blog. I met Korby at Scoble&#8217;s last blogger&#8217;s dinner. He is a <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/permalink.aspx/1ce61a2c-a88b-484e-b9d8-c16f163337a3"> wealth</a> of <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/permalink.aspx/1ce61a2c-a88b-484e-b9d8-c16f163337a3"> information</a> on <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/permalink.aspx/6e856518-a69f-47b0-82f8-420d266c76c4"> VSS</a>. He&#8217;s also into Wikis, something I&#8217;m investigating as part of my new role. I like the idea one of his readers had on a <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/PermaLink.aspx/d214eb34-9617-4ef2-86c7-db2ea53378e3"> .NET doc wiki</a>. However, why would it need to be located at a MS-independent site? Wouldn&#8217;t it be more powerful if MSFT set up and hosted such a site as part of the &#8220;official&#8221; documentation?</p>
<p align="left">Korby also <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/PermaLink.aspx/14138b0e-b5a9-4366-98a0-e2a396633f0f"> blogged</a> on my <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=a6428efe-595e-479a-a3df-3897d6679977"> entry</a> regarding MC++ vs. C#. He did leave out the part that read: &#8220;If you&#8217;re wrapping an existing codebase with a C or C++ API&#8230;&#8221;. Looking back, I think I should have written &#8220;If you&#8217;re wrapping an existing codebase that exposes a C or C++ API&#8230;&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s a law of nature, but I&#8217;ve found it&#8217;s easier to add the managed parts to C++ than translate the whole API into C#.</p>
