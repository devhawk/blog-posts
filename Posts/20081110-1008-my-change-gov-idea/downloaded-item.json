There\u2019s not much up there yet: Obama\u2019s election-night <a href=\"http:\/\/change.gov\/newsroom\/entry\/president_elect_obama_speaks_on_the_eve_of_this_election\/\">Grant Park speech<\/a>, Obama\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/change.gov\/newsroom\/entry\/president_elect_obama_meets_with_economic_advisers_calls_for_swift_action_o\/\">first press conference<\/a> and first <a href=\"http:\/\/change.gov\/newsroom\/entry\/president_elect_obama_calls_for_swift_action_on_the_economy_in_weekly_democ\/\">radio address<\/a> as president-elect, the <a href=\"http:\/\/change.gov\/newsroom\/entry\/emanuel_to_be_obamas_white_house_chief_of_staff\/\">announcement<\/a> that Rahm Emanuel will be Chief of Staff and transition co-chair <a href=\"http:\/\/change.gov\/newsroom\/entry\/transition_team_co_chair_valerie_jarrett_discusses_priorities_on_meet_the_p\/\">Valerie Jarrett\u2019s MTP appearance<\/a>. Of course, it has been less than a week since the election \u2013 there\u2019s only so much that could get done in that time, even when you hit the ground running.<\/p>\n<p>Most interesting about the site is how it invites average American citizens to participate. Maybe not surprising, given the Politics 2.0 campaign Obama ran, but it\u2019s nice to see an administration that\u2019s interested in <a href=\"http:\/\/change.gov\/page\/s\/yourstory\">my story about the election<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/change.gov\/page\/s\/yourvision\">my vision for what America can be<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/change.gov\/page\/s\/ofthepeople\">my ideas about solving our biggest challenges<\/a>. Obviously, it remains to be seen how an Obama administration will use this information, but there\u2019s little reason to ask for everyone\u2019s opinions if you\u2019re not really interested in reading or acting on them.<\/p>\n<p>The one criticism I\u2019d make about the site is that it looks like these stories, visions and ideas aren\u2019t publicly published to the site. Obama\u2019s campaign site had <a href=\"http:\/\/my.barackobama.com\/\">My.BarackObama<\/a> (which will <a href=\"http:\/\/my.barackobama.com\/page\/community\/post\/chrishughesatthecampaign\/gGxZvh\">\u201clive on\u201d<\/a>) but there\u2019s no corollary My.Change.gov \u2013 at least, not yet. On the other hand, with only 71 days until we drop \u201celect\u201d from \u201cpresident-elect\u201d, maybe it makes more sense to hold off on deploying that kind of infrastructure to a more permanent home. Personally, I\u2019m rooting for My.WhiteHouse.gov. My.USA.gov, My.House.Gov and My.Senate.Gov would also be nice to have. Since Change.gov doesn\u2019t publicly publish stories, visions or ideas, I wanted to post my idea here as well. <\/p>\n<p>(Side note, is it just me or is <a title=\"http:\/\/www.usa.gov\/\" href=\"http:\/\/www.usa.gov\/\">http:\/\/www.usa.gov\/<\/a> a pretty crappy home page?)<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, there are immediate <a href=\"http:\/\/change.gov\/agenda\/economy\/\">economic issues<\/a> to deal with and we need to <a href=\"http:\/\/change.gov\/agenda\/iraq\/\">bring the troops home from Iraq<\/a>. But after those, I would like to see the Obama administration put <a href=\"http:\/\/change.gov\/agenda\/energyenvironment\/\">renewable energy<\/a> at the top of it\u2019s priority list. I believe that investing in renewable energy as well as the infrastructure to deliver that energy (the so called \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.repoweramerica.org\/elements\/national-unified-smart-grid\/\">smart grid<\/a>\u201d) should be our top priority because I believe it provides the most bang for the buck when it comes policy. <\/p>\n<p>First off, it will create jobs which is probably the most critical step for turning the economy around. We\u2019ve lost <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/jec.nr0.htm\">1.2 million jobs in the past year<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=96746406\">unemployment is at a 14 year high<\/a>.\u00a0 Second, I\u2019m a big believer in <a href=\"http:\/\/my.barackobama.com\/page\/content\/newenergy_more#oil\">Obama\u2019s long-stated goal<\/a> of eliminating our dependency on foreign oil. This would have the dual benefit of improving our own economy while reducing the economic strength of petro-dictatorships, some of which sponsor terrorism. Third, shifting to clean renewable energy will reduce our carbon emissions. We need to do more on the climate change front, but it\u2019s a good start. Finally, a smart grid would essentially be a new nationwide market for energy. Even though many Republicans are in the pocket of big oil, they are also big believers in free markets and individual responsibility, so maybe smart grid legislation can be passed in a bipartisan way rather than over the Republican\u2019s wishes. <\/p>\n<p>There seems to be a lot of indication already that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/11\/09\/us\/politics\/09promises.html\">energy is Obama\u2019s top priority after an economic stimulus package<\/a>, so maybe he doesn\u2019t need to hear it from me. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the soon-to-be President is continuing to embrace to concepts of Politics 2.0 in an effort to bring Americans together to solve our toughest challenges. Here\u2019s hoping he keeps it up long after \u201celect\u201d is dropped from his title.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The words everyone is using to describe President-Elect Obama\u2019s transition is \u201chit the ground running.\u201d Of all the aspects of the transition, I wanted to call out Change.gov, the new website dedicated to the transition.
