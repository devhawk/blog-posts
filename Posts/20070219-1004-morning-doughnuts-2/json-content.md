-   [Joel Dehlin](http://www.ldscio.org/about-joel/), the CIO of the
    [LDS](http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg) church has an
    interesting [blog
    entry](http://www.ldscio.org/2007/02/16/customization/) on buy
    versus build this morning. His main point is that buying is often
    cheaper, but only if you can move your business processes to match
    the processes in the off-the-shelf software.
-   The search for [Jim Gray](http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/) by
    his friends and colleagues has been [called
    off](http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/16732358.htm).
    Even with a massive high-tech [effort](http://www.helpfindjim.com/)
    no new clues have been turned up. For the sake of his family I do
    hope that the mystery is solved. I would imagine it is very hard to
    not know what happened to him.
-   I am currently running a Build and Deployment Task Force. We are
    trying to ensure that our team follows best practices when building
    new applications. The
    [project](http://devhawk.net/2006/09/07/SOA+Sample+Scenario.aspx)
    that Harry and I are working on seems to be a good test bed for the
    process.
-   For those of you who read my
    [blog](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/) you know I am
    [passionate](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!309.entry)
    about how we implement Service-Oriented Architecture in the real
    world. I have been reading a book titled [Service-Oriented
    Architecture: A Planning and Implementation Guide for Business and
    Technology](http://www.amazon.com/Service-Oriented-Architecture-SOA-Implementation-Technology/dp/0471768944/sr=8-3/qid=1171907563/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/002-9835182-0675229?ie=UTF8&s=books).
    I find the description of real business objections, and how to solve
    them quite refreshing.
-   It appears that the [San Diego Chargers](http://www.chargers.com/)
    are [going](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2771126) to
    hire [Norv
    Turner](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/TurnNo0.htm)
    to replace [Marty
    Schottenheimer](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/SchoMa0.htm)
    as their head coach. I don’t see how fans of the Chargers can
    possibly see this as an improvement.
