<ul><li><a href="http://www.ldscio.org/about-joel/">Joel Dehlin</a>, the CIO of the <a href="http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg">LDS</a> church has an interesting <a href="http://www.ldscio.org/2007/02/16/customization/">blog entry</a> on buy versus build this morning. His main point is that buying is often cheaper, but only if you can move your business processes to match the processes in the off-the-shelf software.</li><li>The search for <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/">Jim Gray</a> by his friends and colleagues has been <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/16732358.htm">called off</a>. Even with a massive high-tech <a href="http://www.helpfindjim.com/">effort</a> no new clues have been turned up. For the sake of his family I do hope that the mystery is solved. I would imagine it is very hard to not know what happened to him.</li><li>I amÂ currently running a Build and Deployment Task Force. We are trying to ensure that our team follows best practices when building new applications. The <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/09/07/SOA+Sample+Scenario.aspx">project</a> that Harry and I are working on seems to be a good test bed for the process.</li><li>For those of you who read my <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/">blog</a> you know I am <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!309.entry">passionate</a> about how we implement Service-Oriented Architecture in the real world. I have been reading a book titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Service-Oriented-Architecture-SOA-Implementation-Technology/dp/0471768944/sr=8-3/qid=1171907563/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/002-9835182-0675229?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Service-Oriented Architecture: A Planning and Implementation Guide for Business and Technology</a>. I find the description of real business objections, and how to solve them quite refreshing.</li><li>It appears that the <a href="http://www.chargers.com/">San Diego Chargers</a> are <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2771126">going</a> to hire <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/TurnNo0.htm">Norv Turner</a> to replace <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/SchoMa0.htm">Marty Schottenheimer</a> as their head coach. I don't see how fans of the Chargers can possibly see this as an improvement.</li></ul>
