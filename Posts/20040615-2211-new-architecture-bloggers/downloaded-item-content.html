<p>We&#8217;ve updated the Architecture Center <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/blogs">blog page</a>. We added <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon">John Evdemon</a> (who I already <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=f389142b-8686-41d1-a100-67b364557d4b">blogged</a>), <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/">Stuart Kent</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alan_cameron_wills">Alan Cameron Wills</a>. Stuart and Alan work on the Enterprise Frameworks and Tools team which is producing the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vsts-arch.asp">VS2005 modeling tools</a> formerly known as Whitehorse. They are mostly blogging about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/alan_cameron_wills/archive/2004/04/13/112473.aspx">domain-specific languages</a> (DSL), <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/alan_cameron_wills/archive/2004/04/13/112431.aspx">software product lines</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2004/06/14/155132.aspx">code generation from models</a> and a variety of other <a href="http://www.softwarefactories.com/">Software Factories</a> related ideas. They also touch on the relationship of the DSL/Factories approach to the UML/MDA approach. Stuart has a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/articles/142330.aspx">great response</a> to a post by <a href="http://www.booch.com/architecture/blog.jsp">Grady Booch</a> where Grady disparages the DSL approach stating that he &#8220;always found the DSL play to be one of classic over-engineering&#8221;. Given the recent &#8220;<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnwantedModelingLanguage.html">Unwanted Modeling Language</a>&#8221; backlash against UML 2, I&#8217;m not sure how fair it is for Grady to be calling any modeling approach over-engineered.</p>
