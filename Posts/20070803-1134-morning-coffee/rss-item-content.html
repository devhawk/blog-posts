<ul><li>Libor Soucek <a href="http://lsblog.wordpress.com/2007/07/30/epilog-on-durable-message-discussion/">continues our conversation</a> about durable messaging. We still don't agree, but he says he "fine" with durable messaging. He does go out of his way to differentiate between *enterprise* and *supporting* systems. But when you're building connected systems, does that differentiation still matter?</li><li>After taking a few months off, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John deVadoss</a> is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2007/08.aspx">back at the blog</a>. Check out his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2007/08/02/big-soa-little-soa-soa-in-the-real-world.aspx">Big SOA/Little SOA post</a>. I especially like his snowball analogy "How do you build a big snowball? You start with a small snowball.") though he's also on this "middle out" bandwagon. Do we really believe "middle out" works, or are we just saying it because we know top down and bottom up don't? And John: You're welcome!</li><li>Anyone coming to the <a href="http://www.mssoaandbpconference.com/">Microsoft SOA &amp; Business Process Conference</a> this fall? Maybe we can have a shindig / blogger dinner / unconference / something?</li><li>Remus Rusanu <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/remusrusanu/archive/2007/07/31/dynamic-routing-service.aspx">writes about</a> SSB's dynamic routing. One of the (many) cool things about SSB is that all the addressing is logical, not physical. Routing is what binds logical addresses to physical addresses, and it's extensible. </li><li>Martin Fowler <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OneLanguage.html">discusses</a> the value of sticking to one language. I agree with his points about large frameworks being as difficult to learn as a new language. I've said for a long time "If you build a framework, build tools to make it easy to use your framework". Language is obviously a core example of a tool. Another interesting point Martin makes is the traditional "intimate relationship" between scripting languages and C, but that the rise of JVM &amp; CLR makes them impossible to ignore. Does the need to play well in a managed environment hinder a C based language like Ruby when compared to a natively managed scripting language like Powershell? Finally, Martin's "jigger of 80 proof ugliness" quote made me laugh. </li><li>Politics 2.0 Watch: EJ Dionne <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/02/AR2007080202023.html">says that</a><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/">DailyKos</a> is doing for Democrats what <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/">Rush Limbaugh</a> did for Republicans almost twenty years ago: mobilization. Josh Marshall <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/016166.php">points out</a> that "what's happening today is vastly more participatory and distributed...than anything happening back then."</li></ul>
