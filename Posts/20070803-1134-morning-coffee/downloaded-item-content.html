<li>Libor Soucek <a href="http://lsblog.wordpress.com/2007/07/30/epilog-on-durable-message-discussion/">continues our conversation</a> about durable messaging. We still don&#8217;t agree, but he says he &#8220;fine&#8221; with durable messaging. He does go out of his way to differentiate between *enterprise* and *supporting* systems. But when you&#8217;re building connected systems, does that differentiation still matter?</li>
<li>After taking a few months off, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John deVadoss</a> is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2007/08.aspx">back at the blog</a>. Check out his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2007/08/02/big-soa-little-soa-soa-in-the-real-world.aspx">Big SOA/Little SOA post</a>. I especially like his snowball analogy &#8220;How do you build a big snowball? You start with a small snowball.&#8221;) though he&#8217;s also on this &#8220;middle out&#8221; bandwagon. Do we really believe &#8220;middle out&#8221; works, or are we just saying it because we know top down and bottom up don&#8217;t? And John: You&#8217;re welcome!</li>
<li>Anyone coming to the <a href="http://www.mssoaandbpconference.com/">Microsoft SOA &amp; Business Process Conference</a> this fall? Maybe we can have a shindig / blogger dinner / unconference / something?</li>
<li>Remus Rusanu <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/remusrusanu/archive/2007/07/31/dynamic-routing-service.aspx">writes about</a> SSB&#8217;s dynamic routing. One of the (many) cool things about SSB is that all the addressing is logical, not physical. Routing is what binds logical addresses to physical addresses, and it&#8217;s extensible. </li>
<li>Martin Fowler <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OneLanguage.html">discusses</a> the value of sticking to one language. I agree with his points about large frameworks being as difficult to learn as a new language. I&#8217;ve said for a long time &#8220;If you build a framework, build tools to make it easy to use your framework&#8221;. Language is obviously a core example of a tool. Another interesting point Martin makes is the traditional &#8220;intimate relationship&#8221; between scripting languages and C, but that the rise of JVM &amp; CLR makes them impossible to ignore. Does the need to play well in a managed environment hinder a C based language like Ruby when compared to a natively managed scripting language like Powershell? Finally, Martin&#8217;s &#8220;jigger of 80 proof ugliness&#8221; quote made me laugh. </li>
<li>Politics 2.0 Watch: EJ Dionne <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/02/AR2007080202023.html">says that</a><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/">DailyKos</a> is doing for Democrats what <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/">Rush Limbaugh</a> did for Republicans almost twenty years ago: mobilization. Josh Marshall <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/016166.php">points out</a> that &#8220;what&#8217;s happening today is vastly more participatory and distributed&#8230;than anything happening back then.&#8221;</li>
