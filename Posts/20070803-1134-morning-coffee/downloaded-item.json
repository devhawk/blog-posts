Check out his <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jdevados\/archive\/2007\/08\/02\/big-soa-little-soa-soa-in-the-real-world.aspx\">Big SOA\/Little SOA post<\/a>. I especially like his snowball analogy &#8220;How do you build a big snowball? You start with a small snowball.&#8221;) though he&#8217;s also on this &#8220;middle out&#8221; bandwagon. Do we really believe &#8220;middle out&#8221; works, or are we just saying it because we know top down and bottom up don&#8217;t? And John: You&#8217;re welcome!<\/li>\n<li>Anyone coming to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mssoaandbpconference.com\/\">Microsoft SOA &amp; Business Process Conference<\/a> this fall? Maybe we can have a shindig \/ blogger dinner \/ unconference \/ something?<\/li>\n<li>Remus Rusanu <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/remusrusanu\/archive\/2007\/07\/31\/dynamic-routing-service.aspx\">writes about<\/a> SSB&#8217;s dynamic routing. One of the (many) cool things about SSB is that all the addressing is logical, not physical. Routing is what binds logical addresses to physical addresses, and it&#8217;s extensible. <\/li>\n<li>Martin Fowler <a href=\"http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/bliki\/OneLanguage.html\">discusses<\/a> the value of sticking to one language. I agree with his points about large frameworks being as difficult to learn as a new language. I&#8217;ve said for a long time &#8220;If you build a framework, build tools to make it easy to use your framework&#8221;. Language is obviously a core example of a tool. Another interesting point Martin makes is the traditional &#8220;intimate relationship&#8221; between scripting languages and C, but that the rise of JVM &amp; CLR makes them impossible to ignore. Does the need to play well in a managed environment hinder a C based language like Ruby when compared to a natively managed scripting language like Powershell? Finally, Martin&#8217;s &#8220;jigger of 80 proof ugliness&#8221; quote made me laugh. <\/li>\n<li>Politics 2.0 Watch: EJ Dionne <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2007\/08\/02\/AR2007080202023.html\">says that<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailykos.com\/\">DailyKos<\/a> is doing for Democrats what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rushlimbaugh.com\/\">Rush Limbaugh<\/a> did for Republicans almost twenty years ago: mobilization. Josh Marshall <a href=\"http:\/\/talkingpointsmemo.com\/archives\/016166.php\">points out<\/a> that &#8220;what&#8217;s happening today is vastly more participatory and distributed&#8230;than anything happening back then.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Libor Soucek continues our conversation about durable messaging.
