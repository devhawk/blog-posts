  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Business Week recently ran a story focusing how on the Gates Foundation is trying (and apparently failing) to help fix the troubles with school systems here in the US.  Throwing money at the problem isn't fixing anything - we've been doing this for decades with nothing to show for it. 

I personally think there are two major problems with public schools (neither of which anyone seems to want to fix):  

1) The governement shouldn't be in the education business - make it a private sector effort.  Force schools to compete for students.

2) The teachers unions (NEA and AF) care more about polticial issues than students.   

Fix those two massive problems and the schools (and students) will be much better off.]]></wp:comment_content>
