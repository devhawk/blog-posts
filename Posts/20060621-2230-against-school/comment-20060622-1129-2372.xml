  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Gatto is right on.  While it is possible to get an education in the public school system, it is not typical.  My suggestion to you with respect to school is to homeschool your little bright ones.  I've been following your wife's blog and Harry, I think the woman could educate a rock.  

We homeschooled most of our kids and the results were pretty good -- the public education racket likes to make a big deal about how qualified they are compared to parents (as in "don't try this at home -- WE'RE professionals), but they are blowing smoke.]]></wp:comment_content>
