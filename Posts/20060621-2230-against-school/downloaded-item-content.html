<p><a href="http://grahamglass.blogs.com/main/2006/06/thought_provoki.html">Graham Glass</a> called <a href="http://www.wesjones.com/gatto1.htm">this article</a> &#8220;thought provoking&#8221;. Calling that an understatement is an understatement it and of itself. The article is by <a href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/">John Taylor Gatto</a>, former NY State and NYC teacher of the year. In this article, he completely shreds the modern school system. He describes our education system as &#8220;deliberately designed to produce mediocre intellects, to hamstring the inner life, to deny students appreciable leadership skills, and to ensure docile and incomplete citizens &#8211; all in order to render the populace &#8216;manageable&#8217;&#8221;. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve long had issues with the education system (I&#8217;d say &#8220;of this country&#8221; but it&#8217;s fairly universal) but I couldn&#8217;t ever articulate them. I&#8217;ve been known to say stuff like &#8220;a diploma is evidence of attendance, not intelligence&#8221; and &#8220;never let school stand in the way of your education&#8221;. I got better at understanding the problem after reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Wave_%28book%29">The Third Wave</a>. Toffler points out the need for an industrial society to have a mass education system to turn children into factory workers. But Toffler doesn&#8217;t really get into the downside of the mass education approach the way Gatto does. Note to self, pick up Gatto&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/index.htm">The Underground History of American Education</a>.</p>
<p>As I type this, I wonder if I&#8217;ll regret blogging this when my kids are in school. I can almost hear the argument now: &#8220;Dad, why should I have to go to school if you think it&#8217;s designed to produce mediocre intellects?&#8221; Frankly, I don&#8217;t have a good answer for that now and I doubt I&#8217;ll have a good one then. (&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Go ask your mother.&#8221; Kidding!) </p>
<p>You know, now that I think about it, I&#8217;m looking forward to that conversation with my kids. Gatto suggests teaching your own children to be leaders and adventures instead of letting schools train them to be employees and servants. A frank discussion about the value of school sounds much more like leadership than servitude to me.</p>
