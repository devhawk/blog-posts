The big new feature is the integrated desktop search. I&#8217;ve been running internal builds for a while, and I love it. Obviously, comparisons will be drawn to Google Desktop but I can&#8217;t comment because Google Desktop wouldn&#8217;t run on my machine because I have the Microsoft ISA Server client (according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/desktop.google.com\/support\/bin\/answer.py?answer=10742\">Google Desktop Help Center<\/a>, the latest version of the ISA client should work, but that&#8217;s what I was running). However, from looking at the <a href=\"http:\/\/desktop.google.com\/screenshots.html\">Google Desktop screen shots<\/a>, I know that Google doesn&#8217;t have my favorite feature of the MSN Toolbar &#8211; the <a href=\"http:\/\/beta.search.msn.com\/docs\/toolbar.aspx?t=MSNTbar_CONC_AboutDeskbar.htm\">Deskbar<\/a>. It&#8217;s available via keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-Alt-M) and supports program execution (type \u201c=appname\u201d to launch appname) as well as <a href=\"http:\/\/beta.search.msn.com\/docs\/toolbar.aspx?t=MSNTBar_CONC_AboutDeskbarShortcuts.htm&amp;v=02.00.00\">typing shortcuts<\/a>. I also like the search results page as I can narrow where my search executes in real time. For example, if I type \u201cOOPSLA\u201d into my deskbar it auto executes the the search across all locations on my desktop. As you would expect, the search screen is near-instant &#8211; just the time it takes to draw the window. Then I can narrow down to just show results from Documents, Email, Music, Pictures &amp; Video, Email Attachments, Meetings, Contacts, etc.\u00a0- in all around 19 different locations. I&#8217;m also only one click away from searching the web, news or images online from the search results screen.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The new MSN Toolbar is now publicly available in beta.
