I finally got to see [The Matrix
Revolutions](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rv_img/revolutions_teaser.jpg).
My whole division saw it on opening day, but since that was during
[SAF](http://devhawk.net/2003/11/04/saf-day-one/), our
team couldn’t go. So we went en masse on Monday. I guess I’m in the
minority, both in blogsphere and on the team, but I really enjoyed it. I
also just finished playing [Enter The
Matrix](http://www.enterthematrixgame.com). Funny coincidence, I reached
the point of the game that corresponds to the end of [The Matrix
Reloaded](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_img/poster_intnl_smith.jpg)
on Sunday, saw Revolutions Monday, finished the game Tuesday. The game
got somewhat decent ratings, but again I liked it. Probably because I
was more interested in it as an adjunct to the movies than as a game.
One review I read complained about the amount of action that took place
during cinematic cut-scenes rather than in the game itself. But since I
played the game primarily for the story, I didn’t mind.
