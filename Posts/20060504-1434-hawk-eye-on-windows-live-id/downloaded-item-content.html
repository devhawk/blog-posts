<p>I am so digging the new new <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/winliveid/blog/cns!AEE1BB0D86E23AAC!222.entry">Windows Live Sign-in Assistant</a>. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, it provides easy signin for people w/ multiple <strike>Passports</strike> Windows Live IDs. I use <a href="http://domains.live.com/">Windows Live Custom Domains</a> to manage my devhawk.net email (which also rocks) which means I have my personal hotmail ID as well as my devhawk email ID. With the sign-in assistant, I get a slick login UI that lets me log in with either ID with a single click. Very nice. So far, the new sign-in only seems to be enabled for <a href="http://ideas.live.com/">Windows Live Ideas</a>, but I assume that will expand over time.</p>
<p>BTW, if you want this new sign-in experience, it looks like you need the new beta of <a href="http://www.ideas.live.com/programPage.aspx?versionId=0eccd94b-eb48-497c-8e60-c6313f7ebb73">Windows Live Messenger</a>. There&#8217;s a bunch of other new stuff in the <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/messengersays/Blog/cns!5B410F7FD930829E!14406.entry">latest beta</a>&nbsp;- new features, better perf and a more polished experience. AFAIK, you still need to be invited to join the beta. I have a bunch of invites &#8211; if you want one, <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net?subject=WLM Invite">drop me a line</a>.</p>
