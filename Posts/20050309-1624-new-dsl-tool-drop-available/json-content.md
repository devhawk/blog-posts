I’ve been doing a bunch of thinking about the use of heavily stereotyped
UML class diagrams and how similar it is to the DSL approach. I’m
working on a new post, but I wanted to parrot
[Gareth](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj) who
[announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/03/09/391276.aspx)
earlier today that the [March 05
CTP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=43636) build of the DSL
toolkit is now available. I’m installing it as I type. Well, not exactly
true – I’m installing VC++. This drop apparently requires it.
