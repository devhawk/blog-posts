<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a bunch of thinking about the use of heavily stereotyped UML class diagrams and how similar it is to the DSL approach. I&#8217;m working on a new post, but I wanted to parrot <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj">Gareth</a> who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/03/09/391276.aspx">announced</a> earlier today that the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=43636">March 05 CTP</a> build of the DSL toolkit is now available. I&#8217;m installing it as I type. Well, not exactly true &#8211; I&#8217;m installing VC++. This drop apparently requires it. </p>
