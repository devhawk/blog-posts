<p>Back in college, I used to DJ for <a href="http://kscr.org/">KSCR</a>, USC&#8217;s student run radio station. I&#8217;ve got a bunch of old cassette of my &#8220;work&#8221;. Now, with the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/drives/6908/">PlusDeck</a>, I could actually install a tape deck in a free 5.25&#8243; drive bay of my home computer. But for $150, I think I&#8217;d rather just plug my old tape deck from the garage into the sound card.</p>
