Back in college, I used to DJ for [KSCR](http://kscr.org/), USC’s
student run radio station. I’ve got a bunch of old cassette of my
“work”. Now, with the
[PlusDeck](http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/drives/6908/), I could
actually install a tape deck in a free 5.25″ drive bay of my home
computer. But for \$150, I think I’d rather just plug my old tape deck
from the garage into the sound card.
