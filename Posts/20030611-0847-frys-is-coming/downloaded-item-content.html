<p>I&#8217;m not the <a href="http://technovangelist.com/blogs/default.aspx?date=06/11/03">first</a> to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/06/11.html#a3311">report</a> this, but <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134930115_frys07.html"> Fry&#8217;s is coming to Renton in mid-July</a> (30 minutes from MSFT Campus). That&#8217;s Fry&#8217;s Electronics, not <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=7a035f70-8234-45b0-9a10-37b51eb175cd">Fry&#8217;s Food &amp; Drug</a>. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group120" alt=":)">  Scoble called it the &#8220;most important news of the day&#8221;. Matt calls it &#8220;Heaven&#8221;. +1</p>
<p>I moved up from Los Angeles to Seattle about 2 years ago and was shocked there wasn&#8217;t a Fry&#8217;s anywhere nearby. (I didn&#8217;t know about the one <a href="http://technovangelist.com/">Matt</a> mentioned in Oregon). Glad to see this oversight is going to be rectified by next month.</p>
