<p>I'm not the <a href="http://technovangelist.com/blogs/default.aspx?date=06/11/03">first</a> to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/06/11.html#a3311">report</a> this, but <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134930115_frys07.html"> Fry's is coming to Renton in mid-July</a> (30 minutes from MSFT Campus). That's Fry's Electronics, not <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=7a035f70-8234-45b0-9a10-37b51eb175cd">Fry's Food &amp; Drug</a>. :) Scoble called it the "most important news of the day". Matt calls it "Heaven". +1</p><p>I moved up from Los Angeles to Seattle about 2 years ago and was shocked there wasn't a Fry's anywhere nearby. (I didn't know about the one <a href="http://technovangelist.com/">Matt</a> mentioned in Oregon). Glad to see this oversight is going to be rectified by next month.</p>
