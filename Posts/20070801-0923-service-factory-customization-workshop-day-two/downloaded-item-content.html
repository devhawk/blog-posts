<p>As expected, day two of the WSSF customization workshop was much meatier than <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/07/31/Service+Factory+Customization+Workshop+Day+One.aspx">day one</a>. If you look at the technologies that power these p&amp;p <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718951.aspx">software factories</a> &#8211; <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718948.aspx">GAT</a> and <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718368.aspx">DSL</a> &#8211; you&#8217;ll notice that they&#8217;re not very well integrated. They share a text templating engine and there are <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905334.aspx">some docs</a>, but that&#8217;s pretty much it. WSSF v3 is the first factory from p&amp;p to heavily use both technologies, and they&#8217;ve had to do significant integration work to make them play nice. </p>
<p>In the new WSSF, there&#8217;s a special &#8220;model project&#8221; where you define data and service contracts independently of an implementation technology. This allows you to postpone your implementation decision as long as possible. For WSSF, this seems pretty pointless &#8211; if you&#8217;re starting a new service project from scratch, why would you build on ASMX instead of WCF? &#8211; but conceptually the idea is rock solid. But this requires a variety of cross-model and cross-project code generation and validation. The vanilla DSL toolkit doesn&#8217;t support that, so the p&amp;p guys had to build it themselves. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see p&amp;p take their GAT/DSL integration work and package it separately from WSSF. As it currently stands, you&#8217;ve got to install GAT &amp; the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700819.aspx">VS SDK</a> (to get DSLs) plus the integration bits from WSSF. There&#8217;s also the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/GEL">GAX Extension Library</a> (aka GEL) plus Clarius&#8217; <a href="http://www.softwarefactoriestoolkit.net/">Software Factory Toolkit</a>. How about a single install to get all that stuff guys?</p>
<p>BTW, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2007/07/03/gax-1-3-for-orcas-announced.aspx">new version of GAT</a> coming soon that will support both VS05 and VS08 Beta 2. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vsxteam/archive/2007/07/01/VSX-Community-Letter-for-July-2007.aspx">According to the VSX team</a>, VS08 beta 2 SDK should also be available &#8220;early August&#8221;. So if you&#8217;re moving over to VS08 (I am), you can still get down and dirty with software factories.</p>
<p>Update: VS08 SDK for Beta 2 is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=d9000e2c-bd3f-4717-a181-723960814e16&displaylang=en">now available</a>. The new version of GAT is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2007/07/19/shipping-gax-1-3.aspx">apparently done</a>, but isn&#8217;t available for download yet.</p>
<p>Later Update: GAX/GAT July CTP is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2007/08/02/new-gax-gat-july-2007-released.aspx">now available</a>.</p>
