Got an email from [Denis Bauer](http://www.denisbauer.com) of [ASP.NET
Version
Switcher](http://www.denisbauer.com/NETTools/ASPNETVersionSwitcher.aspx)
fame. Apparently, I had the wrong link in my toolbox. So I’ve updated
it, plus added [Denis’ blog](http://www.denisbauer.com/weblog) to my MS
BlogRoll. However, I can’t reach Denis’ site right now, so I’m assuming
the URL’s he sent me are right.

I wonder if Denis is in any way related to the [Bauer
Hockey](http://www.bauer.com) equipment maker. Given Microsoft’s
[interest in hockey](http://www.mshockeychallenge.com), it would be good
to know.
