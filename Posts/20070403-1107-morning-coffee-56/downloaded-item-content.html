<li>I survived the weekend no problem. My wife has <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!691.entry">the details</a> of what <em>she</em> did for the weekend while I played Mr. Mom. The kids were great, we even went to see the Easter Bunny on Sunday.&nbsp;Wish the weather had been better, but we did get to go on a little walk around the neighborhood between hailstorms Sunday after naps. </li>
<li>Between taking the kids all morning until Jules got home from the airport and going to <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/recaps/2007/04/02/17528_recap.html">opening day</a> for a team morale event, I worked about 30 minutes yesterday. In case you&#8217;re wondering, that&#8217;s way below average. I typically work at least twice that every day. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group926" alt=":)"> </li>
<li>After maintaining a post a day average for January and February, I slipped a bit in March. Twenty seven posts in thirty one days. So that puts me five posts behind for the year as of this one. </li>
<li><a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/">Dale</a> let me borrow Madden 07 for the weekend so I could <a href="http://live.xbox.com/en-US/profile/Achievements/ViewAchievementDetails.aspx?tid=%09%5D:dh)k0%02p&compareTo=RayTracer">pump my gamerscore</a> (a practice called <a href="http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=4798">gamerscore whoring</a>). I still need 255 points by April 22nd to complete the <a href="http://xboxrewards.msgamestudios.com/challengesandrewards/ChallengeDetail.aspx?id=4">Old Spice Experience Challenge</a>. I&#8217;m not proud of it, but it&#8217;s not like I have much time to play these days.</li>
<li>Mads Kristensen has a new .NET blog engine intuitively called <a href="http://blog.madskristensen.dk/post/Getting-started-with-BlogEngineNET.aspx">BlogEngine.NET</a>. I wonder how it compares to <a href="http://www.dasblog.info/">dasBlog</a>, which powers DevHawk. (via <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/aspnet/The_launch_of_BlogEngine_NET">DotNetKicks</a>)</li>
<li>I wrote a <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/29/Morning+Coffee+55.aspx">last week</a> that unit test support should be in the Express editions of VS. Thanks to Jamie Cansdale, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2007/04/02/express-sku-support.aspx">it is</a>.

<li>Scott Hanselman saved his C# <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/RescuingTheTinyOSInC.aspx">Tiny OS project</a> from the impending shutdown of GDN and reposted it to his blog. I first met Scott at TechEd Malaysia 2002, so I remember seeing him present this &#8220;back in the day&#8221;.</li>
<li>EMI is going to <a href="http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2007/press18.htm">start offering songs</a> sans DRM @ $1.29 a pop. Assuming other labels follow suit, this is gonna be huge. (via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lokeuei/archive/2007/04/02/death-of-drm.aspx">Loke Uei</a>)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Jomo Fisher <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jomo_fisher/archive/2007/03/28/fast-switching-with-linq.aspx">writes</a> about using LINQ as a string switch compiler that&#8217;s about 900% faster than using a hash table. Money quote: &#8220;Any time I see a data structure with a capability I&#8217;m not using it makes me wonder whether I can trade that capability for something I <i>do</i> need&#8212;in this case a speed boost.&#8221; LINQ is turning out to be much more interesting than just a (much) better way to query databases.
