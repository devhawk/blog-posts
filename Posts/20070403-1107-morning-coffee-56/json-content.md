-   I survived the weekend no problem. My wife has [the
    details](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!691.entry)
    of what *she* did for the weekend while I played Mr. Mom. The kids
    were great, we even went to see the Easter Bunny on Sunday. Wish the
    weather had been better, but we did get to go on a little walk
    around the neighborhood between hailstorms Sunday after naps.
-   Between taking the kids all morning until Jules got home from the
    airport and going to [opening
    day](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/recaps/2007/04/02/17528_recap.html)
    for a team morale event, I worked about 30 minutes yesterday. In
    case you’re wondering, that’s way below average. I typically work at
    least twice that every day.
    :smile:
-   After maintaining a post a day average for January and February, I
    slipped a bit in March. Twenty seven posts in thirty one days. So
    that puts me five posts behind for the year as of this one.
-   [Dale](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/) let me borrow Madden 07
    for the weekend so I could [pump my
    gamerscore](http://live.xbox.com/en-US/profile/Achievements/ViewAchievementDetails.aspx?tid=%09%5D:dh\)k0%02p&compareTo=RayTracer)
    (a practice called [gamerscore
    whoring](http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=4798)). I
    still need 255 points by April 22nd to complete the [Old Spice
    Experience
    Challenge](http://xboxrewards.msgamestudios.com/challengesandrewards/ChallengeDetail.aspx?id=4).
    I’m not proud of it, but it’s not like I have much time to play
    these days.
-   Mads Kristensen has a new .NET blog engine intuitively called
    [BlogEngine.NET](http://blog.madskristensen.dk/post/Getting-started-with-BlogEngineNET.aspx).
    I wonder how it compares to [dasBlog](http://www.dasblog.info/),
    which powers DevHawk. (via
    [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/aspnet/The_launch_of_BlogEngine_NET))
-   I wrote a [last
    week](http://devhawk.net/2007/03/29/morning-coffee-55/) that
    unit test support should be in the Express editions of VS. Thanks to
    Jamie Cansdale, [it
    is](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2007/04/02/express-sku-support.aspx).

-   Scott Hanselman saved his C\# [Tiny OS
    project](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/RescuingTheTinyOSInC.aspx)
    from the impending shutdown of GDN and reposted it to his blog. I
    first met Scott at TechEd Malaysia 2002, so I remember seeing him
    present this “back in the day”.
-   EMI is going to [start offering
    songs](http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2007/press18.htm) sans DRM @
    \$1.29 a pop. Assuming other labels follow suit, this is gonna be
    huge. (via [Loke

-   Jomo Fisher
    [writes](http://blogs.msdn.com/jomo_fisher/archive/2007/03/28/fast-switching-with-linq.aspx)
    about using LINQ as a string switch compiler that’s about 900%
    faster than using a hash table. Money quote: “Any time I see a data
    structure with a capability I’m not using it makes me wonder whether
    I can trade that capability for something I *do* need—in this case a
    speed boost.” LINQ is turning out to be much more interesting than
    just a (much) better way to query databases. (via
    [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/csharp/Fast_Switching_with_LINQ))
