Actually, my team has been bugging her team for longer than either of us have been in these jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Last week\u2019s CodePlex release includes a feature known as \u201cEditor Role\u201d. If you look at the <a href=\"http:\/\/ironpython.codeplex.com\/People\/ProjectRoles.aspx\">Project Role Matrix<\/a>, you\u2019ll notice two primary differences from what the standard logged-in user can do: they can create\/edit wiki pages and they <em>can\u2019t <\/em>rate releases. Developers and Coordinators can\u2019t rate releases either \u2013 I guess the idea is that they don\u2019t want members of the team rating their own releases (5 Stars! Again! Wow, we\u2019re awesome!).<\/p>\n<p>Until now, the only way to give members of the community the ability to edit the wiki also gave permission to edit work items, check in source code and make releases. We\u2019re still working on getting Microsoft at large to understand the <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2009\/06\/03\/Strengthening+The+Microsoft+Ecosystem+With+Source+Code.aspx\">benefits of community collaboration aspect in open source<\/a>, but in the meantime we just can\u2019t give those permissions to people off the team. However, we would love to have contributions to our documentation wiki. [1] With the new Editor Role, we\u2019ll be able to grant wiki editor access without any of the other permissions.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the whole idea of \u201cwiki permissions\u201d kinda flies in the face of the basic <a href=\"http:\/\/c2.com\/cgi\/wiki?WikiDesignPrinciples\">wiki design principles<\/a>. So we\u2019re going to be pretty liberal about handing out editor permissions. If you\u2019re interested in editing the wiki, <a href=\"mailto:harry.pierson@microsoft.com?subject=IronPython Wiki Editor Role\">drop me a line<\/a> and I\u2019ll get you hooked up.\u00a0 <\/p>\n<p>Big mega-thanks to the CodePlex team for making this feature happen. I guess I\u2019ll have to find something new to bug Sara about!<\/p>\n<p>[1] You can tell we\u2019re a real open source project because we\u2019re begging for documentation help! <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Ask Sara, I have been bugging her for a LONG time for this CodePlex feature.
