My boss was originally scheduled to do this. Or should I say, my ex-boss?

IronPython is fast\u2014in fact, up to 1.8 times faster than Python-2.4 on the standard pystone benchmark. It supports an interactive interpreter with fully dynamic compilation as well as static compilation to produce pre-compiled executables. It&#8217;s well integrated with the rest of the framework and makes all .NET libraries easily available to Python programmers. This session shows how IronPython brings the power of .NET to Python and the power of Python to .NET. At OSCON 2004, the first public release of IronPython was announced. This session demonstrates the latest IronPython version in a range of situations from using GUI frameworks to driving Microsoft Office applications to working with a variety of external libraries. We also discuss other scripting languages on .NET.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m also going to do a talk on Dynamic Languages in Web Development, focused on Silverlight and ASP.NET. I got asked to do a second session at the last minute (technically, later than the last minute) so this one has no abstract. <\/p>\n<p><strong><u><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px\" height=\"64\" alt=\"teched\" src=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/WindowsLiveWriter\/DevHawkWorldTour2008_DC84\/teched_3.jpg\" width=\"204\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" \/> TechEd <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/nz\/teched08\/index.aspx\">New Zealand<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com.au\/teched\/default.aspx\">Australia<\/a><br \/><\/u><\/strong>Sept 1st &#8211; 5th, Auckland, New Zealand and Sydney, Australia\u00a0 <\/p>\n<p>I did TechEd NZ &amp; Australia back in 2004 and had a blast, so I&#8217;m looking forward to coming back this year.
