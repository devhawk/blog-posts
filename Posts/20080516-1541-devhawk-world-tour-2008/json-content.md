As expected, my new role is going to involve much more travel than my
old role. Here’s a list of all the places I’m going / have been this
year. I’ll be updating this post periodically as I get tapped for more
presentations. There are several other conferences I’m considering,
submitting sessions for, in discussions with, but these are the ones
that are confirmed.

**May 22nd – 23rd, Amsterdam, The Netherlands

This is a kinda last minute pickup. My boss was originally scheduled to
do this. Or should I say, my ex-boss? (I’ve been here less than two
months and already scared off my boss!
![:)](http://devhawk.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) I’m
doing two talks, but I only have the abstract for one of them.

> **DEV315 – “IronPython” and Dynamic Languages on .NET\
> **“IronPython” is the codename for a new implementation of the Python
> programming language on the .NET Framework. IronPython is fast—in
> fact, up to 1.8 times faster than Python-2.4 on the standard pystone
> benchmark. It supports an interactive interpreter with fully dynamic
> compilation as well as static compilation to produce pre-compiled
> executables. It’s well integrated with the rest of the framework and

> IronPython version in a range of situations from using GUI frameworks
> to driving Microsoft Office applications to working with a variety of
> external libraries. We also discuss other scripting languages on .NET.

I’m also going to do a talk on Dynamic Languages in Web Development,
focused on Silverlight and ASP.NET. I got asked to do a second session
at the last minute (technically, later than the last minute) so this one
has no abstract.

and [Australia](http://www.microsoft.com.au/teched/default.aspx)\
**Sept 1st – 5th, Auckland, New Zealand and Sydney, Australia 

I did TechEd NZ & Australia back in 2004 and had a blast, so I’m looking
forward to coming back this year. Content isn’t locked down yet, but I’m
looking to do both a dynamic languages session as well as an
architecture session. There’s also rumor of a web futures panel
discussion that I’ll be participating in.

**Oct 27th – 30th, Los Angeles, California

I’m not doing a session, but I’m helping drive PDC content for my group,
so I’m assuming I’ll be at the conference in some capacity. I’m thinking
we need a dynamic language [open space
session](http://microsoftpdc.com/Agenda/UnSessions.aspx#open-space).

Nov 3rd-7th, Redmond, Washington

I really enjoy p&p Summit because
[Keith](http://weblogs.asp.net/kpleas/) lets me experiment with somewhat
off the wall sessions like “Developer 2.0” and “Moving Beyond Industrial
Software”. Frankly, I have NO idea what I’m going to do at this years’
Summit, but I’m looking to stay outside the box like I have in the past.
