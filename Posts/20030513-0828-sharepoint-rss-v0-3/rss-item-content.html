<p>I've posted an update to my <a href="prj_sharepointsynd.aspx">SharePoint RSS Feed Generator</a> (which I now abbreviate WSS RSS). New features of v0.3 are support for <a href="http://www.opml.org">OPML</a> and support for feed configuration. Now, the admin can specify which top level sites, which subwebs and which lists are included in the RSS or OPML feeds. I've also done a bunch of structural stuff - no more need to edit web.config files. I've also produced separate binary and source archives, which is much easier if you just want to install the bits rather than play with the code.</p><p>I also modified the RSS feed to support <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox">Don's</a><a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx#nn2003-05-11T03:20:30Z"> RSS 2.0 Profile</a> (profile link might be wrong, GDN is down). Here is the OPML profile that I am using in WSS RSS:</p><p>/outline/@type<br /> mandatory - xsd:string<br /> must equal "rss"</p><p>/outline/@title<br /> mandatory if no description, optional otherwise - xsd:string (no embedded markup)<br /> title of the RSS feed (i.e. same as /item/title in RSS)</p><p>/outline/@description<br /> mandatory if no title, optional otherwise - xsd:string (no embedded markup)<br /> description of the RSS feed (i.e. same as /item/description in RSS)</p><p>/outline/@xmlUrl<br /> mandatory - xsd:anyURI (SHOULD be absolute)<br /> url of RSS feed</p><p>/outline/@htmlUrl<br /> mandatory - xsd:anyURI (SHOULD be absolute)<br /> Url of HTML page</p>
