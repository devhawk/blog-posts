<p>Among my other duties, I am co-ower of the <a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/tracks.aspx#a7c12aff-c193-4de3-977c-a8623c7acbe3">architecture track</a> at this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/teched">TechEd</a>. We&#8217;ve got a great track lined up, including two new sessions from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland">Pat Helland</a> in his Metropolis series. You can see an earlier version of the original Metropolis session as part of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series/">Architecture Strategy Series</a> or read an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj2metrop.asp">article</a> about Metropolis&nbsp;in the latest <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal">JOURNAL</a>. I&#8217;m presenting a session on information architecture (guess I gotta get the slides done soon!). Plus there are 15 other great sessions to see on architecture. We&#8217;re also running two precon&#8217;s on architecture : One on <em><a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/precons.aspx#PRC003">patterns and practices</a></em> (run by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kpleas/">Keith Pleas</a>, my recent partner-in-crime on <a href="http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=61">.NET Rocks</a>) and one on <a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/precons.aspx#PRC012">identity management</a>. </p>
<p>After the precons on Sunday night, we&#8217;re having a party &#8211; the <a href="http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp">Architect Road Rally</a>&nbsp;@ the <a href="http://www.sdautomuseum.org/">San Diego Auto Museum</a>.&nbsp;Party goers get a close up look at the <a href="http://www.sdautomuseum.org/exhibit.html">history of Porshe</a>, race RC cars and play the new <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/rallisportchallenge2">Rallisport Challenge 2</a>&nbsp;on Xbox. We&#8217;re also giving away some RC cars as well as copies of RSC2. Plus, food &amp; beer all evening (i.e. this is not an hor&#8217;dourves party). So please <a href="http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp">register</a> and come have a good time.</p>
<p>Finally, we&#8217;re also planning on running focus groups @ TechEd &#8211; your chance to help us help you better with architecture. Also, people chosen to participate in the focus groups get something Cool. <a href="http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp">Register</a> for the focus groups when you register for the road rally.</p>
<p>See you in San Diego! </p>
