They don&#8217;t handle feeds that require authentication. Windows SharePoint is designed to be a team collaboration tool. Obviously, part of team collaboration is not allowing non-team members access.

I was able to add support for credentials via one line of code (request.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;).
