I've got an internal customer running my <a href="prj_sharepointsynd.aspx"> WSS RSS</a> feed generator (perhaps <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/05/16.html#a3046">Scoble will be next</a>?) and I've discovered a common issue with most news aggregators. They don't handle feeds that require authentication. Windows SharePoint is designed to be a team collaboration tool. Obviously, part of team collaboration is not allowing non-team members access. I checked through the source code to <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=cb8d3173-9f65-46fe-bf17-122e3703bb00"> RSS Bandit</a> and discovered that while it handles many HTTP errors, including redirection and moved permanently, it doesn't handle unauthorized. I was able to add support for credentials via one line of code (request.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;). Of course, what I want is to try the default credentials first, then pop up a dialog to allow the user to enter alternative credentials. XP provides some of this plumbing, but I'm not sure how much is exposed via BCL.
