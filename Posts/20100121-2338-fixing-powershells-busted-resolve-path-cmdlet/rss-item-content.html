<div>Usually, my <a href="http://devhawk.net/CategoryView,category,PowerShell.aspx">PowerShell posts</a> are effusive in their praise. However, who thought up this “feature” gets no praise from me:</div>
<pre class="brush: text">PS»Resolve-Path ~missing.file
Resolve-Path : Cannot find path 'C:Usershpiersonmissing.file' because it does not exist.</pre>
<div>In my opinion, this is a bad design. Resolve-Path assumes that if the filename being resolved doesn’t exist, then it must be an error. But in the script I’m building, I’m resolving the path of a file that I’m going to create. In other words, I know a priori that the file doesn’t exist. Yet Resolve-Path insists on throwing an error. I would have expected there to be some switch you could pass to Resolve-Path telling it to skip path validation, but there’s not.</div>
<div>And the worst thing is, I can see that Resolve-Path came up with the “right” answer – it’s right there in the error message!</div>
<div>Searching around, I found <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/powershell/24603-resolve-path-non-existing-file.html">a thread</a> where someone else was having the same problem. Jeffrey Snover – aka Distinguished Engineer, inventor of Powershell and <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/2009/talks/23-ErikMeijer-LiveLabsReactiveFramework.html">target of Erik Meijer’s Lang.NET coin throwing stunt</a> – suggested using <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2006/11/03/erroraction-and-errorvariable.aspx">–ErrorAction and –ErrorVariable</a> to ignore the error and retrieve the resolved path from the TargetObject property error variable. Like Maximilian from the thread, using this approach feels fragile and frankly kinda messy, but I needed a solution. So I wrote the following function that wraps up access to the error variable so at least I don’t have fragile messy code sprinkled through out my script.</div>
<pre class="brush: powershell">function force-resolve-path($filename)
{
  $filename = Resolve-Path $filename -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
                                     -ErrorVariable _frperror
  if (!$filename)
  {
    return $_frperror[0].TargetObject
  }
  return $filename
}</pre>
<div>The script is pretty straightforward. –ErrorAction SilentlyContinue is PowerShell’s version of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5hsw66as.aspx">On Error Resume Next</a> in Visual Basic. If the cmdlet encounters an error, it gets stashed away in the variable specified by ErrorVariable (it’s also added to $Error so you can still retrieve the error object if ErrorVariable isn’t specified) and continues processing. Then I manually check to see if resolve-path succeeded – i.e. did it return a value – and return the TargetObject of the Error object if it didn’t.</div>
<div>As I said, fragile and kinda messy. But it works.</div>
