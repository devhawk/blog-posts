<p>Tanya, my cohort on the Architecture Strategy Marketing team, has finally &#8211; after much promising and subsequent delays &#8211; starter <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/wabi-sabi/">her blog</a>. So far, just she&#8217;s just written a <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/wabi-sabi/Blog/cns!1pr7xQL7OitNcPJpkPBJltuA!105.entry">hello world post</a> where she explains why she named her blog &#8220;Wabi-Sabi&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course, long time readers are probably wondering: &#8220;Did he just say &#8216;Marketing team&#8217;?&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes. Yes I did.</p>
<p>About two weeks ago, I was re-orged to be reporting to <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/">Norman</a>. While you might expect me to be displeased about this, I&#8217;m really ok with it. First off, I was acting as the marketing director for about six months, so the fact that we now have three people doing marketing instead of just me is a huge bonus. Secondly, while I was acting as the marketing director (badly I might add) I was in total firefighting mode &#8211; no opportunity to do advance planning whatsoever. Now, I have the opportunity to focus on doing a great job on a few things well (like the <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ceed2cfc-c011-4f39-aa2b-d98f3bfa9be6">TechEd Architecture track</a>) rather than doing just enough to keep a ton of things from completely falling apart. It&#8217;s taken a while to shift gears, but now I spend more time doing and less time running around like a chicken with my head cut off.</p>
<p>Finally, my move to the marketing team is inherently temporary. Yeah, it&#8217;s fun while it lasts and I&#8217;m learning a ton, but don&#8217;t think this is a long term career change. Before it even happened, Adam (head of Architecture Strategy) explained that he expects me to be over on the architecture side of the house &#8220;soon&#8221;. Norman and I have already started planning that transition. </p>
<p>So get your &#8220;<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kpleas/archive/2004/12/15/316136.aspx">marketing slime</a>&#8221; digs in while you can! (Apparently, we marketing slime prefer the term &#8220;marketing flacks&#8221;.)</p>
