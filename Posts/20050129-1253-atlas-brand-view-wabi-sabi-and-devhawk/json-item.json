Yes I did.<\/p>\n<p>About two weeks ago, I was re-orged to be reporting to <a href=\"http:\/\/atlasbrandview.blogspot.com\/\">Norman<\/a>. While you might expect me to be displeased about this, I&#8217;m really ok with it. First off, I was acting as the marketing director for about six months, so the fact that we now have three people doing marketing instead of just me is a huge bonus. Secondly, while I was acting as the marketing director (badly I might add) I was in total firefighting mode &#8211; no opportunity to do advance planning whatsoever. Now, I have the opportunity to focus on doing a great job on a few things well (like the <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ceed2cfc-c011-4f39-aa2b-d98f3bfa9be6\">TechEd Architecture track<\/a>) rather than doing just enough to keep a ton of things from completely falling apart. It&#8217;s taken a while to shift gears, but now I spend more time doing and less time running around like a chicken with my head cut off.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, my move to the marketing team is inherently temporary. Yeah, it&#8217;s fun while it lasts and I&#8217;m learning a ton, but don&#8217;t think this is a long term career change. Before it even happened, Adam (head of Architecture Strategy) explained that he expects me to be over on the architecture side of the house &#8220;soon&#8221;. Norman and I have already started planning that transition. <\/p>\n<p>So get your &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/kpleas\/archive\/2004\/12\/15\/316136.aspx\">marketing slime<\/a>&#8221; digs in while you can!
