  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wow, I wish the hour I spent on the phone with them working through a bug in their software would have had the same success.  They were telling me that it was Microsoft's fault.  Then the guy proceeded to make up a bunch of technical nonsense to explain why.  When I called him on it, he admitted that he just made it up.  Thirty minutes later, he was telling me that I couldn't be experiencing that problem because it works fine on his computers at home.  :S]]></wp:comment_content>
