FYI, my [Introducing IronPython
article](http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0809071) from
the [.NET Languages issue CoDe
magazine](http://www.code-magazine.com/DisplayIssue.aspx?id=e3b92e0b-1ec4-49d5-a4fb-4c8d4a6d4311)
is now available online in it’s entirety. Previously, only the
introduction was available online. And while we’re on the subject, major
thanks to the folks who at the CoDe magazine booth at PDC, who gave me
several copies of that issue.
