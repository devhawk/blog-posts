If I connect to my host across the virtual network to the loopback adapter then the install works fine. As I said, weird.<\/p>\n<p>On a related note, anyone know a good, simple, free\/cheap DHCP server for XP? The one issue w\/ using the loopback adapter is that you either hardcode network addresses or use the \u201cAutomatic Private Address\u201d (i.e. the 169.254.*.* address). The auto private address works fine, except that it takes a while for the DHCP to time out before assigning the private address. Plus, in XP SP2, there&#8217;s an annoying tray icon that pops up to tell you that the loopback adapter failed to get a DHCP address. If I had a DHCP server for the virtual network hanging off the loopback adapter, then I could avoid all that timeout and annoying pop up tray icon stuff.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m setting up a new SQL 2005 \/ VS 2005 VPC.
