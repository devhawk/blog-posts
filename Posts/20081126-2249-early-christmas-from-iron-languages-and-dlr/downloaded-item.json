With December holidays coming soon, RC2 has a pretty small window before we declare RTM so now is the time to download the release and try your code out.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/rubyforge.org\/frs\/?group_id=4359&amp;release_id=28422\">IronRuby 1.0 Alpha 2<\/a>\u00a0 <br \/>There\u2019s been zero blog traffic on this, just a <a href=\"http:\/\/rubyforge.org\/pipermail\/ironruby-core\/2008-November\/003231.html\">notice on the IronRuby mailing list<\/a>. As per said notice, \u201cNotable features\u201d include \u201cthe inclusion of iirb.bat, igem.bat, irails.bat, irake.bat\u201d. <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/dlr\">New DLR CodePlex Project<\/a> T      <br \/>he DLR source has been available as part of IronPython for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/IronPython\/Release\/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=438\">over a year<\/a> but now they have their own home on CodePlex. Check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/dlr\/Wiki\/View.aspx?title=0.9%20beta%20release%20notes&amp;referringTitle=Home\">Release Notes<\/a> for an overview, reads some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/dlr\/Wiki\/View.aspx?title=Docs%20and%20specs&amp;referringTitle=0.9%20beta%20release%20notes\">Docs and Specs<\/a> or just download their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/dlr\/Release\/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=19885#ReleaseFiles\">initial v0.9 beta<\/a>. Their v0.9 beta is synced with IPy 2.0 RC2 (and their v0.9 final will sync with IPy 2.0 RTM) but it also includes synced versions of IronRuby and ToyScript in both source and binaries. Plus, Sesh <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/seshadripv\/archive\/2008\/11\/26\/dlr-v0-9-beta-released-in-codeplex.aspx\">has promised<\/a> \u201cweekly code drops\u201d. Finally, unlike IronPython and IronRuby, DLR is using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/dlr\/Thread\/List.aspx\">discussion section<\/a> of their CodePlex site \u2013 I\u2019m eager to see how well the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/codeplex\/archive\/2008\/07\/23\/codeplex-project-discussions-mailing-lists.aspx\">new-ish discussion\/mailing list integration<\/a> works.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So there you go, new versions of IronPython and IronRuby plus a whole new DLR CodePlex project to boot.
