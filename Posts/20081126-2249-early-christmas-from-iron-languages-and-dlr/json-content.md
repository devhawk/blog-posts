Tomorrow may be Thanksgiving, but the Microsoft DevDiv dynamic language
teams are trying to make it feel like Christmas with three separate
pre-holiday releases.

1.  [IronPython 2.0
    RC2](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=19841) \
    We were really hoping to only have one release candidate, but we
    ended up with a couple of significant bugs that we couldn’t push off
    to 2.0.1. With December holidays coming soon, RC2 has a pretty small
    window before we declare RTM so now is the time to download the
    release and try your code out.
2.  [IronRuby 1.0 Alpha
    2](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=4359&release_id=28422) \
    There’s been zero blog traffic on this, just a [notice on the
    IronRuby mailing
    list](http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/ironruby-core/2008-November/003231.html).
    As per said notice, “Notable features” include “the inclusion of
    iirb.bat, igem.bat, irails.bat, irake.bat”.
3.  [New DLR CodePlex Project](http://www.codeplex.com/dlr) T\
    he DLR source has been available as part of IronPython for [over a
    year](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=438)
    but now they have their own home on CodePlex. Check out the [Release
    Notes](http://www.codeplex.com/dlr/Wiki/View.aspx?title=0.9%20beta%20release%20notes&referringTitle=Home)
    for an overview, reads some [Docs and
    Specs](http://www.codeplex.com/dlr/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Docs%20and%20specs&referringTitle=0.9%20beta%20release%20notes)
    or just download their [initial v0.9
    beta](http://www.codeplex.com/dlr/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=19885#ReleaseFiles).
    Their v0.9 beta is synced with IPy 2.0 RC2 (and their v0.9 final
    will sync with IPy 2.0 RTM) but it also includes synced versions of
    IronRuby and ToyScript in both source and binaries. Plus, Sesh [has
    promised](http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/11/26/dlr-v0-9-beta-released-in-codeplex.aspx)
    “weekly code drops”. Finally, unlike IronPython and IronRuby, DLR is
    using the [discussion
    section](http://www.codeplex.com/dlr/Thread/List.aspx) of their
    CodePlex site – I’m eager to see how well the [new-ish
    discussion/mailing list
    integration](http://blogs.msdn.com/codeplex/archive/2008/07/23/codeplex-project-discussions-mailing-lists.aspx)
    works.

So there you go, new versions of IronPython and IronRuby plus a whole
new DLR CodePlex project to boot. Enjoy.
