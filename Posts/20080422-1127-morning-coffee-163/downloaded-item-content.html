<p>Between MVP summit last week, ALT.NET this past weekend and an internal brown-bag presentation yesterday, my unread email and blog posts have piled up. Most of the following is old news, but I wanted to get <em>something</em> out. Especially since I feel a case of <a href="http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=361256">Caps Fever coming on</a> that will force &#8211; <em><strong>force</strong></em>you understand &#8211; me to head home early today.</p>
<p>DyLang Stuff</p>
<ul>
<li>My teammate Srivatsn <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/srivatsn/archive/2008/04/12/turning-your-net-object-models-dynamic-for-ironpython.aspx">demonstrates</a> how to make your static C# types act more dynamic in order to interop better with DLR languages. For example, by implementing GetBoundMember and SetMemberAfter, you can support setting arbitrary attributes on a C# class from Python. Cool.  </li>
<li>Today&#8217;s Michael Foord link: <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2008_04_12.shtml#e960">On Testing: Some Programmers Refuse to Get it</a>. He&#8217;s responding to a comment by Allen Holub suggesting that having 110k of test code for 30k of production code is &#8220;a real indictment of the language&#8221; (IronPython). I&#8217;m with Michael on this, Holub&#8217;s suggestion is laughable and worse radically uninformed. I like the way Larry O&#8217;Brien (who passed on Holub&#8217;s comment in the first place) <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,1e1d2066-8a6f-4eb9-aff8-4298736712bc.aspx">describes</a> the views of tests from inside and outside the agile community. I also like his description of tests as &#8220;quality diodes&#8221;.</li>

<p>Other Stuff</p>

<li>Werner Vogels <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/04/persistent_storage_for_amazon.html">posts</a> about a new Amazon EC2 feature: Persistent local storage. Basically, you can create an empty volume up to a terabyte in size and then mount it to your images as a drive. The objective seems to be able to run relational databases in the images, rather than being limited to S3 and SimpleDB. Kinda interesting, but given <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2008/04/introducing-google-app-engine-our-new.html">Google&#8217;s announcement</a> last week, I think the shine is off EC2 a bit.  </li>
<li>This past weekend&#8217;s Twitter outage has Dave Winer <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/04/21/ifThisWereANormalDayOnTwit.html">re-thinking</a> the idea of building networks on a single point of failure. While obviously I agree with the concept, I don&#8217;t agree with his solution that &#8220;We need some big infrastructure companies to get into this game&#8221;. While there are some big blog infrastructures out there, most of that network was built on a massive number of small infrastructures. Why wouldn&#8217;t the same thing work for microblogging?</li>
