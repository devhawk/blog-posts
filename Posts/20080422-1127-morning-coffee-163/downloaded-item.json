For example, by implementing GetBoundMember and SetMemberAfter, you can support setting arbitrary attributes on a C# class from Python. Cool.  <\/li>\n<li>Today&#8217;s Michael Foord link: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.voidspace.org.uk\/python\/weblog\/arch_d7_2008_04_12.shtml#e960\">On Testing: Some Programmers Refuse to Get it<\/a>. He&#8217;s responding to a comment by Allen Holub suggesting that having 110k of test code for 30k of production code is &#8220;a real indictment of the language&#8221; (IronPython). I&#8217;m with Michael on this, Holub&#8217;s suggestion is laughable and worse radically uninformed. I like the way Larry O&#8217;Brien (who passed on Holub&#8217;s comment in the first place) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.knowing.net\/PermaLink,guid,1e1d2066-8a6f-4eb9-aff8-4298736712bc.aspx\">describes<\/a> the views of tests from inside and outside the agile community. I also like his description of tests as &#8220;quality diodes&#8221;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Other Stuff<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Werner Vogels <a href=\"http:\/\/www.allthingsdistributed.com\/2008\/04\/persistent_storage_for_amazon.html\">posts<\/a> about a new Amazon EC2 feature: Persistent local storage. Basically, you can create an empty volume up to a terabyte in size and then mount it to your images as a drive. The objective seems to be able to run relational databases in the images, rather than being limited to S3 and SimpleDB. Kinda interesting, but given <a href=\"http:\/\/googleappengine.blogspot.com\/2008\/04\/introducing-google-app-engine-our-new.html\">Google&#8217;s announcement<\/a> last week, I think the shine is off EC2 a bit.  <\/li>\n<li>This past weekend&#8217;s Twitter outage has Dave Winer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scripting.com\/stories\/2008\/04\/21\/ifThisWereANormalDayOnTwit.html\">re-thinking<\/a> the idea of building networks on a single point of failure. While obviously I agree with the concept, I don&#8217;t agree with his solution that &#8220;We need some big infrastructure companies to get into this game&#8221;. While there are some big blog infrastructures out there, most of that network was built on a massive number of small infrastructures. Why wouldn&#8217;t the same thing work for microblogging?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Between MVP summit last week, ALT.NET this past weekend and an internal brown-bag presentation yesterday, my unread email and blog posts have piled up.
