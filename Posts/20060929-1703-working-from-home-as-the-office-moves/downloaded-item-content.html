<p>Even though I moved offices <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/09/06/Here+Has+Moved+And+Will+Move+Again.aspx">just a month</a> ago, we moved again today. New office won&#8217;t be ready until Monday, so I &#8220;worked from home&#8221;. Of course, with two kids too young for school, getting much actual work done is essentially impossible. I did manage to get my blog upgraded to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DasBlog19Released.aspx">dasBlog 1.9</a> during the kids&#8217; naps.</p>
<p>My new office building is &#8220;Issaquah Black&#8221; which is a much cooler name than &#8220;18&#8243; or &#8220;Sammamish C&#8221;. The building used to be a Boeing building. In fact, my old next door neighbor used to work in this building, back when he and I lived a scant 2.5 mile / 6 minute commute from here. Boeing moved him to Everett and apparently decided to get rid of the building. A year ago, I moved to a new house on the outskirts of Redmond, so my commute is 12.5 miles / 20 minutes. Significantly longer than if I had never moved, but I love my house and can easily deal with a 20 minute commute. Even though main campus is closer (only 8 miles), with all the rush hour traffic it takes closer to 45 to get there!</p>
