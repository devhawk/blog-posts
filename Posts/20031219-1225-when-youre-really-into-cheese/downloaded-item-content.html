<p>And I mean you love cheese. As in you rate cheese and say things to co-workers like &#8220;this is one of my top 15 cheeses in the world&#8221;. You&#8217;ve got to check out <a href="http://www.cheesesociety.org/">The American Cheese Society</a>&nbsp;and their <a href="http://www.cheesesociety.org/pdf/JudgingBrochure03.pdf">annual conference and award winners</a>. They judged over 600 cheeses in 70 categories such as &#8220;Fresh Unripened Hispanic and Portuguese Style&#8221; and &#8220;Sheep&#8217;s Milk Washed Rind&#8221;.
