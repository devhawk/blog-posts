And I mean you love cheese. As in you rate cheese and say things to
co-workers like “this is one of my top 15 cheeses in the world”. You’ve
got to check out [The American Cheese
Society](http://www.cheesesociety.org/) and their [annual conference and
award winners](http://www.cheesesociety.org/pdf/JudgingBrochure03.pdf).
They judged over 600 cheeses in 70 categories such as “Fresh Unripened
Hispanic and Portuguese Style” and “Sheep’s Milk Washed Rind”.

Too bad they didn’t judge any [Venezuelan Beaver
Cheese](http://www.minderella.com/words/cheeseshop.htm).
