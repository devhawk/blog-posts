-   In a surprise to exactly nobody, the Caps [let coach Glen Hanlon
    go](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3123386) yesterday.
    I gotta say I feel for the guy. I mean, he had to go, but still. The
    Caps promoted the coach of their minor league team Bruce Boudreau.
    Makes sense – the farm team is where you develop players, why not
    coaches to? The team responded by beating the Flyers in overtime,
    though they did blow a 3 goal lead along the way.
-   It won’t get them back in the national title hunt, but [thrashing
    ASU](http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273260009) may earn
    USC a ticket to a BCS bowl, or the Rose Bowl if the Ducks can’t win
    without Dennis Dixon.
-   I finally finished [Dead
    Rising](http://www.xbox.com/games/deadrising) today. A sequel has
    been
    [rumored](http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/04/capcom_dead_ris.html)
    and [hinted
    at](http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=71678), but [not
    confirmed](http://www.xboxic.com/news/3327) even though the ending
    left the door wide open. I really enjoyed it, so here’s hoping. I’m
    going to hold off on starting anything new until I get back from
    Canada, but it’ll probably be
    [R6:Vegas](http://www.xbox.com/games/tomclancyrainbowsixvegas/).
    Don’t really have time between now and Christmas to finish [Blue
    Dragon](http://www.xbox.com/games/bluedragonxbox360/) and it’s 3
    DVDs.
-   In more “Screw Turkey Day, we’re shipping anyway” news, p&p shipped
    a new version of the [Web Service Software
    Factory](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb931187.aspx).
    This one’s called the “Modeling Edition”. I saw some of this stuff
    [back in
    August](http://devhawk.net/2007/08/01/service-factory-customization-workshop-day-two/),
    and I like what those p&p folks are doing. It’s worth a look, just
    to see how they’ve integrated DSL and GAT.
-   My old team shipped a [new
    version](http://www.codeplex.com/LitwareHR/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8439)
    of their S+S demo app LitwareHR. There’s also some
    [tools](http://www.codeplex.com/LitwareHR/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8440)
    for testing multi-tenant databases.
-   Quick reminder: I’m @ [DevTeach](http://www.devteach.com/) Vancouver
    next week, so blogging will be light. I’ve got a series of thoughts
    on F\# ready to post, but we’ll see when I get network access to
    post them. Given that I took a month off from blogging a short while
    back, I didn’t bother asking
    [Dale](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/) to cover for me.
