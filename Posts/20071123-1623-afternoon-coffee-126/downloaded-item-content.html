<li>In a surprise to exactly nobody, the Caps <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3123386">let coach Glen Hanlon go</a> yesterday. I gotta say I feel for the guy. I mean, he had to go, but still. The Caps promoted the coach of their minor league team Bruce Boudreau. Makes sense &#8211; the farm team is where you develop players, why not coaches to? The team responded by beating the Flyers in overtime, though they did blow a 3 goal lead along the way.

<li>It won&#8217;t get them back in the national title hunt, but <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273260009">thrashing ASU</a> may earn USC a ticket to a BCS bowl, or the Rose Bowl if the Ducks can&#8217;t win without Dennis Dixon.

<li>I finally finished <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/deadrising">Dead Rising</a>&nbsp;today. A sequel has been <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/04/capcom_dead_ris.html">rumored</a> and <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=71678">hinted at</a>, but <a href="http://www.xboxic.com/news/3327">not confirmed</a>&nbsp;even though the ending left the door wide open. I really enjoyed it, so here&#8217;s hoping. I&#8217;m going to hold off on starting anything new until I get back from Canada, but it&#8217;ll probably be <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/tomclancyrainbowsixvegas/">R6:Vegas</a>. Don&#8217;t really have time between now and Christmas to finish <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bluedragonxbox360/">Blue Dragon</a> and it&#8217;s 3 DVDs.

<li>In more &#8220;Screw Turkey Day, we&#8217;re shipping anyway&#8221; news, p&amp;p shipped a new version of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb931187.aspx">Web Service Software Factory</a>. This one&#8217;s called the &#8220;Modeling Edition&#8221;. I saw some of this stuff <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/08/01/Service+Factory+Customization+Workshop+Day+Two.aspx">back in August</a>, and I like what those p&amp;p folks are doing. It&#8217;s worth a look, just to see how they&#8217;ve integrated DSL and GAT.

<li>My old team shipped a <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/LitwareHR/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8439">new version</a> of their S+S demo app LitwareHR. There&#8217;s also some <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/LitwareHR/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8440">tools</a> for testing multi-tenant databases.

<li>Quick reminder: I&#8217;m @ <a href="http://www.devteach.com/">DevTeach</a> Vancouver next week, so blogging will be light. I&#8217;ve got a series of thoughts on F# ready to post, but we&#8217;ll see when I get network access to post them. Given that I took a month off from blogging a short while back, I didn&#8217;t bother asking <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/">Dale</a> to cover for me. </li>
