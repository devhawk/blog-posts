Makes sense &#8211; the farm team is where you develop players, why not coaches to? The team responded by beating the Flyers in overtime, though they did blow a 3 goal lead along the way.\n<\/li>\n<li>It won&#8217;t get them back in the national title hunt, but <a href=\"http:\/\/scores.espn.go.com\/ncf\/recap?gameId=273260009\">thrashing ASU<\/a> may earn USC a ticket to a BCS bowl, or the Rose Bowl if the Ducks can&#8217;t win without Dennis Dixon.\n<\/li>\n<li>I finally finished <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/deadrising\">Dead Rising<\/a>\u00a0today. A sequel has been <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.wired.com\/games\/2007\/04\/capcom_dead_ris.html\">rumored<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eurogamer.net\/article.php?article_id=71678\">hinted at<\/a>, but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xboxic.com\/news\/3327\">not confirmed<\/a>\u00a0even though the ending left the door wide open. I really enjoyed it, so here&#8217;s hoping. I&#8217;m going to hold off on starting anything new until I get back from Canada, but it&#8217;ll probably be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/tomclancyrainbowsixvegas\/\">R6:Vegas<\/a>. Don&#8217;t really have time between now and Christmas to finish <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/bluedragonxbox360\/\">Blue Dragon<\/a> and it&#8217;s 3 DVDs.\n<\/li>\n<li>In more &#8220;Screw Turkey Day, we&#8217;re shipping anyway&#8221; news, p&amp;p shipped a new version of the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/bb931187.aspx\">Web Service Software Factory<\/a>. This one&#8217;s called the &#8220;Modeling Edition&#8221;. I saw some of this stuff <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/08\/01\/Service+Factory+Customization+Workshop+Day+Two.aspx\">back in August<\/a>, and I like what those p&amp;p folks are doing. It&#8217;s worth a look, just to see how they&#8217;ve integrated DSL and GAT.\n<\/li>\n<li>My old team shipped a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/LitwareHR\/Release\/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8439\">new version<\/a> of their S+S demo app LitwareHR. There&#8217;s also some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/LitwareHR\/Release\/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8440\">tools<\/a> for testing multi-tenant databases.\n<\/li>\n<li>Quick reminder: I&#8217;m @ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.devteach.com\/\">DevTeach<\/a> Vancouver next week, so blogging will be light. I&#8217;ve got a series of thoughts on F# ready to post, but we&#8217;ll see when I get network access to post them.
