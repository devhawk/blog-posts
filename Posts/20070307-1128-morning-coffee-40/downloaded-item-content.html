<li>My boss let me borrow a Tecra M4 that he scavenged from his boss. The display is fairly twitchy, I think it&#8217;s a motherboard issue. But it&#8217;s very intermittent and I&#8217;ll get help desk to take a look. In the meantime, it sure is nice to driving a Tablet PC again. And it&#8217;s Vista ready to boot.  </li>
<li>Speaking of Vista, Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 Update for Windows Vista. It&#8217;s a mouthful but it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=90E2942D-3AD1-4873-A2EE-4ACC0AACE5B6&displaylang=en">now available</a>. Soma <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2007/mar07/03-06VisualStudio.mspx">answers questions</a> about the new release on MS PressPass. </li>
<li>The DSL tools team keeps on rolling with the power toys. First it was the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bfba74af-4f28-44cc-8de5-0c3c55d21863&displaylang=en">Designer Integration PowerToy</a>, now it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/dsltreegrideditor">DSL Tree Grid Editor PowerToy</a>. Jeff Santos <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jezzsa/archive/2007/03/01/dsl-user-experience-powertoy.aspx">has the details</a>. </li>
<li>I missed the TechFest keynote yesterday, but it&#8217;s <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/">available on demand</a>. They also have <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/demos.aspx">descriptions</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/videos/default.aspx">videos</a>&nbsp;of some of the technologies on display. (well, only one video so far, but I assume since the page is labeled &#8220;TechFest 2007 Videos&#8221; that more are on the way.)  </li>
<li>There&#8217;s new support for integrating WCF and WF coming in VS &#8220;Orcas&#8221;. Moustafa Khalil Ahmed <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/moustafa/archive/2007/03/04/visual-studio-orcasand-wf-wcf-rules-changes.aspx">has the details</a> on what&#8217;s new for WF &amp; WCF in the latest CTP drop. For me personally, the WCF/WF integration is some of the most important stuff coming in Orcas, second only to LINQ.</li>
