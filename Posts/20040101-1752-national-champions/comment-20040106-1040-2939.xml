  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[What I found most interesting about the final coaches poll is that 3 coaches actually broke from their contractual obligation and voted for USC as #1.  

A couple of weeks ago I heard an interview with Grant Teaff, the Executive Director of the American Football Coaches Association, which is the group that does the coaches poll and agreed to name the BCS champion as their champion, and he claimed that on the final ballot they only had slots for 2-25 -- that they truly couldn't vote for #1 even if they wanted to.  So I wonder what those three coaches did, or was Teaff just blowing smoke?

More interesting would be to find out who those three coaches were and see if they are invited to participate next year.]]></wp:comment_content>
