  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[True, but the general consensus from the articles I've read is that the BCS really screwed up on this one. The fact is that the coaches were forced to vote LSU, rather than being allowed to honestly vote their opinion. I wonder how many coaches would have droped USC to #2 if they had had any choice in the matter.

Though, truth be told, I'm glad LSU won. I didn't think OU deserved to be there and based on what I've read about the game, they proved that on the field. ]]></wp:comment_content>
