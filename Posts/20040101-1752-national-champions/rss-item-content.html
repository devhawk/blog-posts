Congrats to <a href="http://uscfootball.com/">SC</a> for their 28-14 victory over Michigan @ the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls03/bowl?game=rose">Rose Bowl</a> and for winning at least a share of the national championship. Now, my Sunday night is clear since I don't need to watch the Nokia "Battle for Second Place" bowl (which I <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e2d55e21-3063-40ba-a23d-b1ac4d569d8f">blogged</a> a month ago).  </p><p>UPDATE: I added a link to a picture my son all decked out in his Trojan gear and smiling wide after winning the national championship (actually, his mother is making faces off camera).</p><p>Another UPDATE: I found a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jasonsalas/archive/2004/01/06/47798.aspx">great post</a> on the subject of the BCS by Jason Salas via <a href="http://bryan.daneman.org/?entryID=550">Bryan's Weblog of Stuff</a>. Jason is a .NET developer and a sportscaster, so his views on the BCS from both sides are facinating (though he did mix up the AP and the Coaches poll).</p>
