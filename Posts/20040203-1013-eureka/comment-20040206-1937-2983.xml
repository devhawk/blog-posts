  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[One of my best friends in college used this technique religiously. If he ever got stuck on a problem, he would go take a shower - and emerge 10 minutes later with an answer. 

In fact, his only problem was that once he figured things out, he never actually wanted to DO them. To him, the "challenging" part was already done.
