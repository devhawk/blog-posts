<blockquote><p>I had a great idea while I was in the shower this morning (all great ideas come while bathing, at least in my experience), and it proved to work famously. [<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/archive/2004/02/03/66689.aspx">Robert McLaws</a>]</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve joked in the past that if I took more showers I&#8217;d be filthy rich. Apparently, I&#8217;m not the only one who does their best thinking while bathing. It&#8217;s a rich tradition, dating back to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AhHa">Archimedes</a> who figured out in the bath that you can measure the volume of an irregular object (in his case, a crown) by measuring the volume of the water it displaced. </p>
<p>Actually, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the bathing &#8211; it&#8217;s the disconnection. In my office I have a phone, two laptops connected to the Internet, four virtual PCs, <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=dd06efd1-cf51-4eed-927a-c82a01273b47">twelve books</a>, about a ream of various papers plus a pretty nice view of outside. In the shower, I have nothing but soap (not SOAP) and my thoughts. </p>
