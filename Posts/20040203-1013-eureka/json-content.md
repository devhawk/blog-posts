I’ve joked in the past that if I took more showers I’d be filthy rich.
Apparently, I’m not the only one who does their best thinking while
bathing. It’s a rich tradition, dating back to
[Archimedes](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AhHa) who figured out in the bath
that you can measure the volume of an irregular object (in his case, a
crown) by measuring the volume of the water it displaced.

Actually, I don’t think it’s the bathing – it’s the disconnection. In my
office I have a phone, two laptops connected to the Internet, four
virtual PCs, [twelve
books](http://devhawk.net/2004/02/02/my-work-bookshelf/), about
a ream of various papers plus a pretty nice view of outside. In the
shower, I have nothing but soap (not SOAP) and my thoughts.
