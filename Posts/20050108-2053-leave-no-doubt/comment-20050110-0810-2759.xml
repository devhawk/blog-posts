  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, we can agree on this.  USC is the proud new owner of an uncontested national championship, and it is well deserved.  I personally don't think things like "how convincing was the win" should come into play in the rankings, but the bottom line is, while I think Auburn would have put up more of a fight than OU, I don't think they would have won.  USC came to play, and claimed their national title with fervor.

Congrats.]]></wp:comment_content>
