I got to watch the game with several college buddies (the benefit of vacationing in LA) and we just had a ball. After the bittersweet shared championship last year, this feels great. Who would have thought it would be over at halftime? I called it &#8220;in the refrigerator&#8221; 4 minutes into the third when SC went up 45-10. I would have called it at half time, but I figured OU would come out with some life in the second half, but they didn&#8217;t.</p>

Even the most die-hard Auburn fan, having watched their team nearly blow the Sugar Bowl the night before, has got to be hard pressed to honestly argue that they deserve to be #1. Especially when they think to the last time they played USC &#8211; they got <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=232420002">shutout at home 23-0</a>. Sure, Auburn isn&#8217;t the same team but then again, neither is USC.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s already talk of USC being a <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls04/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&id=1959543">dynasty</a> and of a threepeat (or should that be three-Pete?) Frankly, that talk is a little premature in my opinion. But given the massive drought USC football went through when I was in school there (during the decade long plus losing streak to Notre Dame) it sure is nice to be on top.</p>
