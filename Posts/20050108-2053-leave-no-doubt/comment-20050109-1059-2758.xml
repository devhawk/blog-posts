  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I disagree on the Auburn comment- I think they can make a credible claim. They had a close game with Va. Tech, which probably should have beaten USC earlier in the season. That was a very close game with some questionable calls. Those kinds of calls are part of every game though, and USC did win. But it was close (closer than the score indicates). Also, I think it is clear that the SEC is a tougher conference to play in, and Auburn ran the table.

Having said all that, my personal opinion is that USC proved that they deserve it this year.]]></wp:comment_content>
