-   I forgot to add a number to my [last morning coffee
    post](http://devhawk.net/2007/08/03/Morning+Coffee.aspx). However,
    after extensive research, I have determined that it was \#108. So
    thing are continuing as usual today with \#109. On the other hand,
    do you really want development and architecture opinions from a guy
    who can barely count?

-   The finalists in the [Dream-Build-Play
    contest](http://www.dreambuildplay.com/)[have been
    announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/08/03/dream-build-play-finalists-announced.aspx).
    I haven’t played any of them yet (some are [available for
    download](http://swampthingtom.blogspot.com/2007/08/congrats-to-dbp-winners.html))
    but they several of them sure look good.
-   And speaking of gaming, MS
    [announced](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/08/06/PriceDropAug8FP.aspx)
    an Xbox 360 price drop yesterday. So if you want to get in on some
    of the XNA action, here’s your chance (or you could just build for
    your PC – take your pick).
-   Finally on the gaming front, if you’re not busy Monday you can
    [watch the first
    day](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LetsKillDave/~3/141730154/gamefest-webcasts-keynote-plus-first-day-of-xna-game-studio-track.aspx)
    of [Gamefest 2007](http://www.xnagamefest.com/) online. Get the
    scoop on XNA 2.0 as well as the new XNA networking support. I, alas,
    am busy Monday so I’ll have to catch it on demand.
-   On to, you know, actual geek stuff things. Scott Guthrie seems to
    have retired his LINQ to SQL series and [moved
    on](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/08/07/using-linq-to-xml-and-how-to-build-a-custom-rss-feed-reader-with-it.aspx)
    to LINQ to XML. He shows how to build an RSS reader application with
    LINQ to XML. An oldie demo, but a goodie.
-   Wanna learn F\#, there’s a [whole site of
    samples](http://www.codeplex.com/fsharpsamples) up on CodePlex. (via
    [Don
    Syme](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/08/03/new-codeplex-project-f-programming-samples.aspx))
-   Jeff Atwood is annoyed at how many different products you have to
    install to get a current & complete setup of VS 2005. Of course, MS
    shipped two parts of that stack since VS05 shipped (TFS & DBPro),
    three service packs (VS05 SP1, SQL 05 SP2 and DBPro SR1) and a major
    OS upgrade (VS Vista update). Doesn’t the same thing happen with any
    shipping product after a few years? BTW, if this is such a huge
    hassle, I wonder why Jeff doesn’t create a [slipstreamed VS
    installer](http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2006/12/16/slipstreaming-visual-studio-2005-service-pack-1.aspx)?
-   Udi Dahan has a [great post on
    estimation](http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/08/06/dont-trust-developers-with-project-management/)
    where he claims “Developers don’t know how to estimate.” No
    argument, but the way he phrases it sounds like it’s the developer’s
    fault they suck at estimation. It’s not. Developing – by definition
    – is building something you’ve never built before. Is it any
    surprise we suck at estimating how long it will take us to do
    something we’ve never done before?
