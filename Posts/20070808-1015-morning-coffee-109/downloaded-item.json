I haven&#8217;t played any of them yet (some are <a href=\"http:\/\/swampthingtom.blogspot.com\/2007\/08\/congrats-to-dbp-winners.html\">available for download<\/a>) but they several of them sure look good. <\/li>\n<li>And speaking of gaming, MS <a href=\"http:\/\/gamerscoreblog.com\/team\/archive\/2007\/08\/06\/PriceDropAug8FP.aspx\">announced<\/a> an Xbox 360 price drop yesterday. So if you want to get in on some of the XNA action, here&#8217;s your chance (or you could just build for your PC &#8211; take your pick).<\/li>\n<li>Finally on the gaming front, if you&#8217;re not busy Monday you can <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/LetsKillDave\/~3\/141730154\/gamefest-webcasts-keynote-plus-first-day-of-xna-game-studio-track.aspx\">watch the first day<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xnagamefest.com\/\">Gamefest 2007<\/a> online. Get the scoop on XNA 2.0 as well as the new XNA networking support. I, alas, am busy Monday so I&#8217;ll have to catch it on demand.<\/li>\n<li>On to, you know, actual geek stuff things. Scott Guthrie seems to have retired his LINQ to SQL series and <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2007\/08\/07\/using-linq-to-xml-and-how-to-build-a-custom-rss-feed-reader-with-it.aspx\">moved on<\/a> to LINQ to XML. He shows how to build an RSS reader application with LINQ to XML. An oldie demo, but a goodie.<\/li>\n<li>Wanna learn F#, there&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/fsharpsamples\">whole site of samples<\/a> up on CodePlex. (via <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dsyme\/archive\/2007\/08\/03\/new-codeplex-project-f-programming-samples.aspx\">Don Syme<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Jeff Atwood is annoyed at how many different products you have to install to get a current &amp; complete setup of VS 2005. Of course, MS shipped two parts of that stack since VS05 shipped (TFS &amp; DBPro), three service packs (VS05 SP1, SQL 05 SP2 and DBPro SR1) and a major OS upgrade (VS Vista update). Doesn&#8217;t the same thing happen with any shipping product after a few years? BTW, if this is such a huge hassle, I wonder why Jeff doesn&#8217;t create a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/heaths\/archive\/2006\/12\/16\/slipstreaming-visual-studio-2005-service-pack-1.aspx\">slipstreamed VS installer<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li>Udi Dahan has a <a href=\"http:\/\/udidahan.weblogs.us\/2007\/08\/06\/dont-trust-developers-with-project-management\/\">great post on estimation<\/a> where he claims &#8220;Developers don\u2019t know how to estimate.&#8221; No argument, but the way he phrases it sounds like it&#8217;s the developer&#8217;s fault they suck at estimation. It&#8217;s not. Developing &#8211; by definition &#8211; is building something you&#8217;ve never built before. Is it any surprise we suck at estimating how long it will take us to do something we&#8217;ve never done before? <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I forgot to add a number to my last morning coffee post.
