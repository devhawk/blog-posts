<li>I forgot to add a number to my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/08/03/Morning+Coffee.aspx">last morning coffee post</a>. However, after extensive research, I have determined that it was #108. So thing are continuing as usual today with #109. On the other hand, do you really want development and architecture opinions from a guy who can barely count? <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group1024" alt=":)"> </li>
<li>The finalists in the <a href="http://www.dreambuildplay.com/">Dream-Build-Play contest</a><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/08/03/dream-build-play-finalists-announced.aspx">have been announced</a>. I haven&#8217;t played any of them yet (some are <a href="http://swampthingtom.blogspot.com/2007/08/congrats-to-dbp-winners.html">available for download</a>) but they several of them sure look good. </li>
<li>And speaking of gaming, MS <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/08/06/PriceDropAug8FP.aspx">announced</a> an Xbox 360 price drop yesterday. So if you want to get in on some of the XNA action, here&#8217;s your chance (or you could just build for your PC &#8211; take your pick).</li>
<li>Finally on the gaming front, if you&#8217;re not busy Monday you can <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LetsKillDave/~3/141730154/gamefest-webcasts-keynote-plus-first-day-of-xna-game-studio-track.aspx">watch the first day</a> of <a href="http://www.xnagamefest.com/">Gamefest 2007</a> online. Get the scoop on XNA 2.0 as well as the new XNA networking support. I, alas, am busy Monday so I&#8217;ll have to catch it on demand.</li>
<li>On to, you know, actual geek stuff things. Scott Guthrie seems to have retired his LINQ to SQL series and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/08/07/using-linq-to-xml-and-how-to-build-a-custom-rss-feed-reader-with-it.aspx">moved on</a> to LINQ to XML. He shows how to build an RSS reader application with LINQ to XML. An oldie demo, but a goodie.</li>
<li>Wanna learn F#, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/fsharpsamples">whole site of samples</a> up on CodePlex. (via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/08/03/new-codeplex-project-f-programming-samples.aspx">Don Syme</a>)</li>
<li>Jeff Atwood is annoyed at how many different products you have to install to get a current &amp; complete setup of VS 2005. Of course, MS shipped two parts of that stack since VS05 shipped (TFS &amp; DBPro), three service packs (VS05 SP1, SQL 05 SP2 and DBPro SR1) and a major OS upgrade (VS Vista update). Doesn&#8217;t the same thing happen with any shipping product after a few years? BTW, if this is such a huge hassle, I wonder why Jeff doesn&#8217;t create a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2006/12/16/slipstreaming-visual-studio-2005-service-pack-1.aspx">slipstreamed VS installer</a>?</li>
<li>Udi Dahan has a <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/08/06/dont-trust-developers-with-project-management/">great post on estimation</a> where he claims &#8220;Developers don&#8217;t know how to estimate.&#8221; No argument, but the way he phrases it sounds like it&#8217;s the developer&#8217;s fault they suck at estimation. It&#8217;s not. Developing &#8211; by definition &#8211; is building something you&#8217;ve never built before. Is it any surprise we suck at estimating how long it will take us to do something we&#8217;ve never done before? </li>
