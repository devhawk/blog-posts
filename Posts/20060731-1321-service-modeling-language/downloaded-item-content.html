<p>On the one hand, this seems like a somewhat arbitrary name change &#8211; from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/sdm.mspx">System Defintion Model</a> to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/serviceml.mspx">Service Modeling Language</a>. And the use of the term &#8220;Service&#8221; instead of &#8220;System&#8221; seems sketchy to me.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you gotta love this line from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jul06/07-31SMLPR.mspx">press release</a>: &#8220;The group plans to submit the draft specification to an industry standards organization later this year.&#8221; Given the companies involved in &#8220;the group&#8221; &#8211; MSFT, IBM, BEA, Sun, Dell, BMC, Cicso, Intel, HP and EMC &#8211; you gotta think SML has a bright future. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping that publishing the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/serviceml.mspx">SML spec</a> is the first step in a public-workshop-based revision process, a la the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/community/workshops/default.aspx">Web Services Protocol Workshops</a>. </p>
