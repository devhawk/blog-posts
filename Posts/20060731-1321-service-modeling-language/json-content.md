On the one hand, this seems like a somewhat arbitrary name change – from
[System Defintion
Model](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/sdm.mspx) to
[Service Modeling
Language](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/serviceml.mspx).
And the use of the term “Service” instead of “System” seems sketchy to
me.

On the other hand, you gotta love this line from the [press
release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jul06/07-31SMLPR.mspx):
“The group plans to submit the draft specification to an industry
standards organization later this year.” Given the companies involved in
“the group” – MSFT, IBM, BEA, Sun, Dell, BMC, Cicso, Intel, HP and EMC –
you gotta think SML has a bright future.

Here’s hoping that publishing the [SML
spec](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/serviceml.mspx)
is the first step in a public-workshop-based revision process, a la the
[Web Services Protocol
Workshops](http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/community/workshops/default.aspx).
