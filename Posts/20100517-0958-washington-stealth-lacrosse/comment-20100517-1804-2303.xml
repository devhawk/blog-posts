  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm sorry sir, but as a Pens fan, I completely object to the idea that we got beaten by a drum in Game 7 against the Habs.

We got our a$$e$ whipped and handed back to us in a burlap sack.

Please correct this oversight...LOL.

Boston's performance has to be the worst because it is so historic.  The #1 seed has lost in the first round before (forgetting the year, but the Wings did it at least once, if not twice...which might bode well for the Caps as much as I cringe to think about it as a Pens fan...back in the day, I think there was a movement to dump Yzerman from the Wings because he couldn't win...think about that for a minute).]]></wp:comment_content>
