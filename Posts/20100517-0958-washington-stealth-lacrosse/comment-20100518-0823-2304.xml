  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I dunno - teams have blown 3-1 series leads and #1 seeds have lost to #8 seeds, but the combination of #1 seed blowing a 3-1 series hasn't ever happned, so I still think it's worse than Boston's performance, though maybe only worse by a little bit.

Comparisons to Yzerman's Wings as well as Gretzky's Oilers have been plentiful in Washington. I just hope management doesn't hear those and think nothing has to change. The team doesn't need to be blown up and rebuild, but it does need tweaking. ]]></wp:comment_content>
