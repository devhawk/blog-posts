<p>I may be at Strategic Architect Forum, but I&#8217;ve actually been coding off and on today -&nbsp;using WSE2 to expose web services. I hadn&#8217;t realized that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wseref/html/T_Microsoft_Web_Services2_Messaging_SoapService.asp">SoapService</a>&nbsp;supports auto generation of WSDL &#8211; pretty cool. I dug around with Reflector to figure out how it works. Turns out that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wseref/html/T_Microsoft_Web_Services2_Messaging_SoapReceiver.asp">SoapReceiver</a> (parent of SoapService) exposes a method called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wseref/html/M_Microsoft_Web_Services2_Messaging_SoapReceiver_GetDescription_1_19f87a31.asp">GetDescription</a> that returns the WSDL as an XmlDocument. The SoapReceiver version of GetDescription returns null, but the SoapService implementation uses an internal class called WsdlCreator to generate construct a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemWebServicesDescriptionServiceDescriptionClassTopic.asp">ServiceDescription</a> from SoapService type that you write. Pretty cool. </p>
<p>The only downside is that if you use raw <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wseref/html/T_Microsoft_Web_Services2_SoapEnvelope.asp">SoapEnvelope</a>s as the input and output parameter of the SoapService methods, the WsdlCreator has no way to know what schema to use for the corrisponding SOAP messages. So, it punts and represents a SoapEnvelope as sequence of xsd:any tags. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_sad.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group449" alt=":(">  If you use XML serializable types for parameters, then the WsdlCreator generates the associated schema in the WSDL. Only issue, I gave up on XML serialization <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5643b052-f1f2-4c53-ac33-e33d0910f917">a while ago</a>. </p>
<p>I wish there was a way to adorn the SoapService methods with an attribute indicating the associated message schemas (with the ability to&nbsp;validate those messages automatically). </p>
