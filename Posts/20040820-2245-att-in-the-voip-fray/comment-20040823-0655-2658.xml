  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[hey Harry!

Yeah, I use Vonage for my business line at home as it was MUCH cheaper then installing my own land line, or having an additional phone drop added to my office (yes, my builder didn't put a phone line in my office. GRR).

So far Vonage has been awesome! I pay $15/month for 500 minutes (I never use that much, personally). And, have all the great features (more then what I get on my land line and pay an arm and a leg for).

It's good to see AT&T pushing their VOIP. Traditional phone companies should be scared. This technology is awesome, and a low price point. 


Take care!
