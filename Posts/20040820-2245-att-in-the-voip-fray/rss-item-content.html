<p>Watching the Olympics I've seen ads for AT&amp;T's <a href="http://www.usa.att.com/callvantage/">CallVantage</a>, a VOIP service similar to <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> and <a href="https://www.lingo.com/guWeb/">Lingo</a> (any others?). All three have the basics - Unlimited calling to US &amp; Canada, voicemail, call waiting/forwarding, 911 support, caller ID &amp; 3-way calling. However, each has a feature or two that the others don't. AT&amp;T has Do Not Disturb (no big deal) and Personal Conferencing up to nine people (wow!). Vonage has a soft phone (i.e. an app that acts like a phone so you can call and receive calls while on the road). Lingo is the cheapest ($20 a month + 3 free months) and Western Europe is included in the unlimited free calling area (hello brother-in-law from Germany). I'm leaning towards Lingo as I don't need personal conferencing (I organize groups of people outside my immediate family with email) and when I travel with my family, I don't really spend much time online so the soft phone is of limited use. One issue - checking out <a href="http://www.broadbandreports.com/isplist?t=voip">Broadband Reports VOIP reviews</a>, <a href="http://www.broadbandreports.com/reviews/2475">Lingo sounds like</a> it's got really awful tech support. But, with three months free, I'm hoping I can try it out and cancel it if it's a problem.</p><p>Update - I called Lingo and they confirmed they have an activation fee as well as aÂ 30 day cancellation policy. So while the first three months are free, you pay $10 S&amp;H and $30 to activate. If you cancel the service in the first 30 days, you can get your $30 back. And there is no service contract, so you can cancel anytime (not sure if the other services require a contract or not).</p>
