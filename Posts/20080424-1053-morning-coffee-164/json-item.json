I&#8217;ve been running it for about a month, and I&#8217;m really digging it. Make sure you check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/livemesh\/\">team blog<\/a> and watch the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mesh.com\/Welcome\/TourDeveloper.aspx\">developer tour video<\/a> (be on the lookout for IPy about half way thru the video)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>ALT.NET<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I had a great time @ the <a href=\"http:\/\/altdotnet.org\/\">ALT.NET<\/a> open space conference last weekend. I was somewhat distracted on Saturday as due to a family communication mixup, I had to bring my son Patrick with me. <a href=\"http:\/\/codebetter.com\/blogs\/jeffrey.palermo\/\">Jeffrey Palermo<\/a> shot a <a href=\"http:\/\/codebetter.com\/blogs\/jeffrey.palermo\/archive\/2008\/04\/19\/alt-net-attendees-video-posted.aspx\">cute video of him<\/a> (3 minutes in) where he explains that he&#8217;s at the conference &#8220;to be with my dad&#8221;. Having a five year old is a little distracting, but everyone was amazingly cool with having him around. When he gets a little older I have no doubt he&#8217;ll be attending conferences and leading open sessions.  <\/li>\n<li>I did a session on F#, but it felt kinda all over the place. I hadn&#8217;t touched F# in a few months and it showed IMO. <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/podwysocki\/default.aspx\">Matt Podwysocki<\/a> was there to help keep the session from devolving into mass chaos. Thanks Matt.  <\/li>\n<li>My favorite session of the conference was Scott Hanselman&#8217;s &#8220;Are We Innovating?&#8221; talk, which I think originated from a question I asked him: There are many examples of large OSS projects in other dev communities that get ported to .NET (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hibernate.org\/343.html\">NHibernate<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/nant.sourceforge.net\/\">NAnt<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.castleproject.org\/monorail\/index.html\">MonoRail<\/a>, etc). Can you name one that&#8217;s gone the other way? I can&#8217;t.  <\/li>\n<li>I took <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/podwysocki\/archive\/2008\/04\/24\/alt-net-open-spaces-closing-day-recap.aspx\">Matt&#8217;s advice<\/a> and joined the local <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/altnetseattle\">ALT.NET Seattle group<\/a>. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>DyLang Stuff<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Martin Maly <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mmaly\/archive\/2008\/04\/22\/dlr-caches.aspx\">posts about<\/a> how dynamic method dispatches are cached in three different layers by the DLR. You shouldn&#8217;t care about this stuff if you&#8217;re a DLR language user, but you will certainly care about it if you&#8217;re a DLR language builder.  <\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m really excited to see Phil Haack (whom I met F2F @ ALT.NET) is <a href=\"http:\/\/haacked.com\/archive\/2008\/04\/22\/defining-asp.net-mvc-routes-and-views-in-ironruby.aspx\">experimenting with IronRuby &amp; ASP.NET MVC<\/a>. True, I&#8217;d rather it was IPy, but his Routes.LoadFromRuby would work with Python with very little code change.  <\/li>\n<li>Note to self, take a deeper look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.t3rse.com\/twining\/\">Twining<\/a>, the IPy database DSL by <a href=\"http:\/\/metadeveloper.blogspot.com\/\">David Seruyange<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Daily Michael Foord &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.voidspace.org.uk\/python\/weblog\/arch_d7_2008_04_19.shtml#e968\">Ironclad 0.2 Released<\/a>. Ironclad is a project to implement <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.python.org\/api\/api.html\">Python&#8217;s C extension API<\/a> in C# so that IronPython could load standard Python C modules like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scipy.org\/\">SciPy<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.numpy.org\/\">NumPy<\/a>. So far, they&#8217;re able to load the <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.python.org\/lib\/module-bz2.html\">bz2 module<\/a>.\u00a0 <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Other Stuff<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Congrats to <a href=\"http:\/\/bradwilson.typepad.com\/blog\/2008\/04\/xunitnet-10-rel.html\">Brad<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/jamesnewkirk.typepad.com\/posts\/2008\/04\/xunitnet-10-rel.html\">Jim<\/a> for shipping <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/xunit\/Release\/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=12516\">xUnit.net 1.0<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Everyone seems to be jumping on the functional C# coding bandwagon. Bart De Smet&#8217;s series on pattern matching in C# is <a href=\"http:\/\/community.bartdesmet.net\/blogs\/bart\/archive\/2008\/04\/16\/pattern-matching-in-c-part-8.aspx\">currently at eight posts<\/a>. Now Luca Bolognese is in on the action, with three posts so far on <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/lucabol\/archive\/2008\/04\/21\/a-c-library-to-write-functional-code-part-iii-records.aspx\">functional code in C#<\/a>. I like how Luca keeps writing that the C# syntax is &#8220;not terrible&#8221; for functional programming. Again, why suffer thru the &#8220;not terrible&#8221; syntax when you could be using F# instead?
