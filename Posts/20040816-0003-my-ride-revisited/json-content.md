I’m not sure how this happened, but I overwrote the following post from
[July 27th](http://devhawk.net/default.aspx?date=2004-07-27). Found the
original in [Google’s
cache](http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:RVMCz2V4UzQJ:devhawk.net/default.aspx?date=2004-07-28+july+site:devhawk.net&hl=en),
but not before I deleted the original. So here it is again:

wants to know what kind of cars ‘softies drive. I drive a green 2002
Chevy Blazer. This picture is from Patrick’s trip home from the
hospital. In the picture, you can see my old car – a purple ’97 GMC
Sonoma pickup truck. That got traded in earlier this year for a [Nissan
Quest
minivan](http://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/ModelHomePage/0,,29706,00.html).
Those two cars take a fair bit of gas, so we’re thinking of getting a
hybrid – Ford has a [hybrid Escape
SUV](http://www.fordvehicles.com/escapehybrid/home/index.asp) coming
this year. My mom has a hybrid Honda and loves it. In the meantime, I
try to carpool or bus (or hit [John](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/) up
for a ride) to work as often as possible.
