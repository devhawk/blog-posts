<p>I&#8217;m not sure how this happened, but I overwrote the following post from <a href="http://devhawk.net/default.aspx?date=2004-07-27">July 27th</a>. Found the original in <a href="http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:RVMCz2V4UzQJ:devhawk.net/default.aspx?date=2004-07-28+july+site:devhawk.net&hl=en">Google&#8217;s cache</a>, but not before I deleted the original. So here it is again:</p>

I drive a green 2002 Chevy Blazer. This picture is from Patrick&#8217;s trip home from the hospital. In the picture, you can see my old car &#8211; a purple &#8217;97 GMC Sonoma pickup truck. That got traded in earlier this year for a <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/ModelHomePage/0,,29706,00.html">Nissan Quest minivan</a>. Those two cars take a fair bit of gas, so we&#8217;re thinking of getting a hybrid &#8211; Ford has a <a href="http://www.fordvehicles.com/escapehybrid/home/index.asp">hybrid Escape SUV</a> coming this year. My mom has a hybrid Honda and loves it. In the meantime, I try to carpool or bus (or hit <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/">John</a> up for a ride) to work as often as possible.</p>
