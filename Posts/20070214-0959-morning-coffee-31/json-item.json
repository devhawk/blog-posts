Chapter 8 is called &#8220;ScriptBlocks and Objects&#8221; and it is specifically about meta-programming. After reading that chapter, PS seems <em>more<\/em> flexible in this space than Ruby, which is the current industry darling for metaprogramming. For example, in Ruby you can optionally pass a block of code to any method. In PS, you can define a ScriptBlock like any other parameter. That means you can tell from the method signature that the ScriptBlock is used. Or you can define a function that takes multiple ScriptBlock parameters. Much more thought on this is needed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Architect MVP business news keeps on coming.
