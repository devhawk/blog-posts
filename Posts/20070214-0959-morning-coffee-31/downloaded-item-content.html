<li>Architect MVP business news keeps on coming. Today it&#8217;s Corillian &#8211; the company Scott Hansleman works for &#8211; <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheNextStepCheckFreeToAcquireCorillianFor245m.aspx">getting acquired by CheckFree</a>. </li>
<li>Los Angeles is looking to provide <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-fi-wifi14feb14,0,3502072.story">city-wide low-cost (maybe free) wireless access</a>. My father has often suggested that Internet access be treated like other utilities like water and power. Sounds like LA is heading down that path. I wonder if they&#8217;re looking at WiMAX?</li>
<li>The <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/embedded/bb267253.aspx">.NET Micro Framework</a> &#8211; which powers <a href="http://direct.msn.com/">the SPOT watch</a> &#8211; now has an SDK. For those keeping track, that makes three embedded solution platforms from Microsoft, the Micro FX, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/embedded/eval/wince">Windows CE</a> (which also just shipped a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/feb07/02-11WM6SoftwarePR.mspx">new version</a>) and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/embedded/eval/xpe">Windows XP Embedded</a>.

<li>The final version of <a href="http://mobile.search.live.com/about/">Live Search for Mobile</a> was released a few days ago. This program rocks.&nbsp;I&#8217;m using the Windows Mobile version, but there&#8217;s also&nbsp;J2ME version as well.

<li>Any lingering interest I had in Ruby vanished yesterday as got to chapter 8 of <a href="http://www.manning.com/payette/">Windows Powershell in Action</a>. Chapter 8 is called &#8220;ScriptBlocks and Objects&#8221; and it is specifically about meta-programming. After reading that chapter, PS seems <em>more</em> flexible in this space than Ruby, which is the current industry darling for metaprogramming. For example, in Ruby you can optionally pass a block of code to any method. In PS, you can define a ScriptBlock like any other parameter. That means you can tell from the method signature that the ScriptBlock is used. Or you can define a function that takes multiple ScriptBlock parameters. Much more thought on this is needed.</li>
