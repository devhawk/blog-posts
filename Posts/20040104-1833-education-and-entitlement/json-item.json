The deal is that many people believe in the \u201cequality\u201d phase our culture has cultivated. What I mean is, treating people in the most PC or Fair way has led many children to feel that they are owed something in their future. No one is owed a thing. We are lucky to live in a country where our rights are honored, to be sure, but believe me; we are not striving very hard as a culture to maintain our supremacy of success.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are slowly becoming a nation of people who wield our sense of entitlement recklessly and at the cost of our own opportunity<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0I wish she&#8217;d come work for Microsoft&#8217;s learning business unit.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I sent my wife a link to Joshua&#8217;s entry on offshoring.

I sometimes come across as bing down on the whole educational system, but my point really is that a teacher can never *make* a student learn; teachers exist to give the *opportunity* to the students, and it&#8217;s (for the most part) up to the students to take advantage of the opportunity.  We still have the best opportunities for education in the world, but increasingly kids have other priorities and distractions.<\/p>\n","parent":0}],"attachments":[],"comment_count":2,"comment_status":"closed","custom_fields":{"dasblog_entryid":["e45706ad-f832-4503-8c4c-3ec2431fcb3b"],"dasblog_compressedtitle":["Education+And+Entitlement"],"dasblog_compressedtitleunique":["2004\/01\/05\/Education+And+Entitlement"]}},"previous_url":"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2004\/01\/04\/eating-dogfood\/","next_url":"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2004\/01\/04\/another-neat-blogger\/"}
