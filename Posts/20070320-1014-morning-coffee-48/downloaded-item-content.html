<li>Yesterday, I followed on Martin Fowler&#8217;s post on going transactionless. As I said yesterday, I didn&#8217;t agree with the idea of no transactions inside a service, but I agree 100% with no transactions between services. Via Paul Brown, <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2007/03/20/not-quite-no-transactions">we learn</a> that EBay does allow forbids the use of <u><em>client-side or distributed transactions</em></u>, but doesn&#8217;t outlaw the use of transactions in general. That makes much more sense to me since transactions between services would have to be are distributed.</li>

<li>DevHawk made Todd Bishop&#8217;s Microsoft Blog Directory. It&#8217;s in the &#8220;Software Development and Design&#8221; section. Not sure why I&#8217;m listed <em>above </em><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/">Raymond Chen</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/johnmont">John Montgomery</a>, <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">Chris Sells</a> and <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/">Don Box</a> in that section, but that&#8217;s nice company to be included with.</li>
