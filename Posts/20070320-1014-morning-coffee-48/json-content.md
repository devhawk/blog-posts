-   [John Backus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Backus), leader of
    the team that developed the first high-level programming language,
    [died
    yesterday](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/19/obituaries/20cnd-backus.html?ex=1332043200&en=adde3ee5a1875330&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink).
    It’s been a hard year so far for IT industry luminaries. (via [Good

-   Yesterday, I followed on Martin Fowler’s post on going
    transactionless. As I said yesterday, I didn’t agree with the idea
    of no transactions inside a service, but I agree 100% with no
    transactions between services. Via Paul Brown, [we
    learn](http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2007/03/20/not-quite-no-transactions)
    that EBay does allow forbids the use of *client-side or distributed
    transactions*, but doesn’t outlaw the use of transactions in
    general. That makes much more sense to me since transactions between
    services would have to be are distributed.

    “Cool toys and fun projects you and your kids do together”.

-   DevHawk made Todd Bishop’s Microsoft Blog Directory. It’s in the
    “Software Development and Design” section. Not sure why I’m listed
    *above* [Raymond Chen](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/), [John
    Montgomery](http://blogs.msdn.com/johnmont), [Chris
    Sells](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/) and [Don
    Box](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/) in that section, but that’s
    nice company to be included with.
