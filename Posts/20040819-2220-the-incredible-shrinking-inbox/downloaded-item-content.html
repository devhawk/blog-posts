<p>My inbox is getting to be reasonable again. After two weeks on the road, it got up over 300 messages even though <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=2b81fdd2-5613-4e1c-9cee-8a8c271db283">I cleaned it out before I left</a>. Now, it&#8217;s back down to 45 messages. I already use rules to break out messages that come to various mailing lists, that come to our team alias, or ones that I&#8217;m cc&#8217;ed on. I&#8217;ve realized that everything that comes into my inbox falls into one of three categories: shit I need to know, shit I need to do, and shit I don&#8217;t need. I&#8217;m trying to be really diligent getting all these things out of my inbox. Shit I need to do gets moved to the task list. Shit I need to know gets moved into some other folder &#8211; usually by category though I have <a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/">Lookout</a> if I need to search for it. Shit I don&#8217;t need gets deleted. Of course, once I&#8217;m done with my inbox, I&#8217;ve still got to tackle those nearly 400 messages in my cc, team and not to me folders. I&#8217;m hoping this will help me stay better organized &#8211; something I manager tells me that I need to work on (along with focusing on what&#8217;s important and improving my diplomacy). One thing that taking <a href="http://devhawk.net/default.aspx?date=2003-09-22">this job</a> has taught me, you can always get more email, whether you want it or not!</p>
