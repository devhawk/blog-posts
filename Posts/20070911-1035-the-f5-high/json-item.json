Sorry about that, Loren.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>The F5 High<\/h3>\n<h4>Hunting and farming in the next generation of software development<\/h4>\n<p>A little while ago I was having an intense discussion with a colleague of mine Scott Colestock while we were both out at Microsoft.\u00a0 We were discussing the ever present need some developers have to build things themselves instead of looking for something to leverage or using an off the shelf product.\u00a0 After we were postulating a couple of off the wall, overly judgmental and holier than thou theories behind this phenomenon, Scott said something that really hit home and opened my eyes to an interesting explanation of what might really be going on.\u00a0 He offhandedly said maybe it is not about ego or fear of less than adequate solutions at all; maybe it is actually bout the F5 high instead.\u00a0 The F5 high\u2026 hmmm have not heard of that one.\u00a0 What is the F5 high I asked him?\u00a0 The F5 high, you know, that feeling you get when you hit F5 in the development environment and something happens.\u00a0 Come on, admit it, It feels good.\u00a0 As I took in the idea, I realized that he was totally right, it does feel good, it is a sense of accomplishment, it is an ultra quick hit, and more importantly, it makes us want to do it again.\u00a0 This simple button and the rote process wrapped around it is a gateway to experiencing indisputable proof of our own creativity.\u00a0 So to some extent, we are able to become our own dealer, dolling out small packets of that near harmless drug called satisfaction whenever we want.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So after this grand near religious realization of our true essence and this new found understanding behind that very special little key, we moved back on topic and continued our discussion about architecture.<\/p>\n<p>Later on I was replaying the discussion between Scott and I with another colleague of mine, Jon Tobey.\u00a0 Jon is one of the most avid fisherman I know.\u00a0 Right in the middle of my F5 story, just when I thought mans greatest revelation had been already been achieved, if you can even imaging anything greater, he proceeded to add yet another improvement to the growing theory.\u00a0 He took the F5 high concept and explained it in the context of fishing.\u00a0 As a sportsman, fishing is about the hunt, it is about the building feeling you get when there is a bite and the exhilaration that courses through your veins as you attempt to catch and reel in the unknown trophy on the other end of you line.\u00a0 In the case of fishing, we don\u2019t even keep the fish, we throw it back for reuse.\u00a0 Considering that we return the fish to the pond or stream from which we caught it, fishing is clearly much more about the rewards of the process and not about the value proposition of the actual fish.<\/p>\n<p>If we approached fishing trips like software projects there would be some very strange consequences.\u00a0 Firstly, we would have to keep everything we caught \u2013 even if it is not a fish and even if we did not catch it.\u00a0\u00a0 Then we would bring them back to office and try and probably have to cram them though the little slots on the sharepoint server or something.\u00a0 Reusing fish would be dramatically less fulfilling, we would just take the dead fish, somehow work a hook into its mouth, throw it across the floor, and then yank the rod with excitement on a par with a kid on the traveling carnival merry go round.\u00a0 Then drag the lifeless fish corpse across the floor by reeling it in until it reached the end of our rod.\u00a0 Take it off and throw it back across the floor, repeat.\u00a0 Man, that sounds exciting doesn\u2019t it?\u00a0 So where does that leave us?\u00a0 Right now we have a very smelly server closet and a bunch of drug crazed developers yanking dead fish around the office hoping to somehow score an F5 fix while wondering when fish serialization technology will reach the point where the rehydrated fish are slightly more exciting.\u00a0 They are all very excited about the new social network called FishTank 2.0 where anyone can reel in anyone else\u2019s dead fish.\u00a0 This does not look good \u2013 I must need a quick hit of F5 &#8211; {F5} \u2013 crap, well not so exciting, it turns out that F5 in word fires up the find and replace box and I remain unfulfilled.<\/p>\n<p>So it appears that good developers, aka hunters, need to do some fishing every once in a while to keep the monotony of eating fish every day in check.\u00a0 For when this get too far out of balance, the devs usually start using the project managers as the fish and the requirements of the project as the river.\u00a0 They bait the project managers and try to yank them off the page and into something new, something that will give them that F5 fix they so desperately need.\u00a0 When the PMs tell them NO, they might go to the users, a different company, who knows?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>A while back, my good friend and MAAB cohort Loren Goodman sent me the following.
