If you think Washington can&#8217;t be a hockey town, you are sorely mistaken.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of the Caps, they are establishing a &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/capitals.nhl.com\/team\/app\/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=23007\">spirit squad<\/a>&#8220;? Is that really necessary? (short answer: no). <a href=\"http:\/\/peerlessprognosticator.blogspot.com\/2008\/07\/weve-got-spirit-how-bout-you.html\">Peerless&#8217; take<\/a> is hilarious.  <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/seshadripv\">Seshadri Vijayaraghavan<\/a> is a tester on the DLR team and he&#8217;s been writing quite a bit about the DLR hosting API. He&#8217;s got a series of posts about <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/seshadripv\/archive\/2008\/06\/24\/how-to-write-a-simple-dlr-host-in-c-using-hosting-api.aspx\">hosting<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/seshadripv\/archive\/2008\/06\/30\/how-to-invoke-a-python-function-from-c-using-the-dlr-hosting-api.aspx\">invoking<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/seshadripv\/archive\/2008\/07\/08\/how-to-redirect-output-from-python-code-using-the-dlr-hosting-api.aspx\">redirecting output<\/a> from IronPython in a C# application. <\/li>\n<li>I haven&#8217;t seen an official announcement, but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.liveside.net\/blogs\/main\/archive\/2008\/07\/17\/microsoft-opens-up-live-mesh-for-basic-mobile-access.aspx\">mobile access to Live Mesh is available<\/a> by pointing your phone browser to <a href=\"http:\/\/m.mesh.com\">http:\/\/m.mesh.com<\/a>. It&#8217;s mostly a web view of the Live Desktop, though there is a feature to upload photos from your phone. However, for some reason that feature doesn&#8217;t work for me right now. I don&#8217;t get the &#8220;browse&#8221; button. <\/li>\n<li>ASP.NET MVC Preview 4 is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/aspnet\/Release\/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=15389\">available for download<\/a>. Phil Haack has <a href=\"http:\/\/haacked.com\/archive\/2008\/07\/16\/aspnetmvc-codeplex-preview4.aspx\">a few details<\/a> that ScottGu didn&#8217;t cover. Scott Hanselman shows off <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/ScottHanselman\/~3\/337456906\/ASPNETMVCPreview4UsingAjaxAndAjaxForm.aspx\">some AJAX stuff<\/a>. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Scott Hanselman, he <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/LearningOpportunityNETTerrariumIsBack.aspx\">highlights<\/a> the <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/bsimser\/archive\/2008\/07\/16\/reintroducing-terrarium-now-with-2-0-goodness.aspx\">return of Terrarium<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/bsimser\/default.aspx\">Bil Simser<\/a>. Scott mentions that most Terrarium animal implementations were big collections of nested if statements. I wonder if F# pattern matching would be a cleaner approach?  <\/li>\n<li>Ted Neward obviously never &#8220;even tangentially&#8221; touched politics, as I think they have far worse flame wars far more often than we have in the software industry. However, certainly the Scala flame war <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/07\/16\/Of+Zealotry+Idiocy+And+Etiquette.aspx\">he&#8217;s commenting on<\/a> seems fairly counterproductive.  <\/li>\n<li>Brad Wilson <a href=\"http:\/\/bradwilson.typepad.com\/blog\/2008\/07\/creating-nullab.html\">runs into a wall<\/a> trying to convert a string to an arbitrary Nullable&lt;T&gt;.He doesn&#8217;t find an answer, but I found reading thru the steps he took to try and find an answer strangely compelling. <\/li>\n<li>Jeff Atwood argues that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codinghorror.com\/blog\/archives\/001152.html\">Maybe Normalization isn&#8217;t Normal<\/a>. It&#8217;s mostly a collection of information from other places, including a compilation of high-scale database case studies. But it&#8217;s a useful collection of info and links, with a little common-sense thrown in for good measure. <\/li>\n<li>I have a hard time imagining <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/pathelland\/archive\/2008\/07\/16\/a-weekend-at-foo-camp.aspx\">Pat Helland camping<\/a>. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Check out the crowd for a the Washington Capitals developmental camp scrimmage last week (My parents are in their somewhere).
