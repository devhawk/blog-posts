Standing room only in the practice facility to watch a bunch of kids, most of whom won&#8217;t ever make it to the NHL, in July. If you think Washington can&#8217;t be a hockey town, you are sorely mistaken.  </li>
<li>Speaking of the Caps, they are establishing a &#8220;<a href="http://capitals.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NHLPage&id=23007">spirit squad</a>&#8220;? Is that really necessary? (short answer: no). <a href="http://peerlessprognosticator.blogspot.com/2008/07/weve-got-spirit-how-bout-you.html">Peerless&#8217; take</a> is hilarious.  </li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv">Seshadri Vijayaraghavan</a> is a tester on the DLR team and he&#8217;s been writing quite a bit about the DLR hosting API. He&#8217;s got a series of posts about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/06/24/how-to-write-a-simple-dlr-host-in-c-using-hosting-api.aspx">hosting</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/06/30/how-to-invoke-a-python-function-from-c-using-the-dlr-hosting-api.aspx">invoking</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/07/08/how-to-redirect-output-from-python-code-using-the-dlr-hosting-api.aspx">redirecting output</a> from IronPython in a C# application. </li>
<li>I haven&#8217;t seen an official announcement, but <a href="http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2008/07/17/microsoft-opens-up-live-mesh-for-basic-mobile-access.aspx">mobile access to Live Mesh is available</a> by pointing your phone browser to <a href="http://m.mesh.com">http://m.mesh.com</a>. It&#8217;s mostly a web view of the Live Desktop, though there is a feature to upload photos from your phone. However, for some reason that feature doesn&#8217;t work for me right now. I don&#8217;t get the &#8220;browse&#8221; button. </li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC Preview 4 is <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=15389">available for download</a>. Phil Haack has <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/07/16/aspnetmvc-codeplex-preview4.aspx">a few details</a> that ScottGu didn&#8217;t cover. Scott Hanselman shows off <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/337456906/ASPNETMVCPreview4UsingAjaxAndAjaxForm.aspx">some AJAX stuff</a>. </li>
<li>Speaking of Scott Hanselman, he <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LearningOpportunityNETTerrariumIsBack.aspx">highlights</a> the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/2008/07/16/reintroducing-terrarium-now-with-2-0-goodness.aspx">return of Terrarium</a> from <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/default.aspx">Bil Simser</a>. Scott mentions that most Terrarium animal implementations were big collections of nested if statements. I wonder if F# pattern matching would be a cleaner approach?  </li>
<li>Ted Neward obviously never &#8220;even tangentially&#8221; touched politics, as I think they have far worse flame wars far more often than we have in the software industry. However, certainly the Scala flame war <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/07/16/Of+Zealotry+Idiocy+And+Etiquette.aspx">he&#8217;s commenting on</a> seems fairly counterproductive.  </li>
<li>Brad Wilson <a href="http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2008/07/creating-nullab.html">runs into a wall</a> trying to convert a string to an arbitrary Nullable&lt;T&gt;.He doesn&#8217;t find an answer, but I found reading thru the steps he took to try and find an answer strangely compelling. </li>
<li>Jeff Atwood argues that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001152.html">Maybe Normalization isn&#8217;t Normal</a>. It&#8217;s mostly a collection of information from other places, including a compilation of high-scale database case studies. But it&#8217;s a useful collection of info and links, with a little common-sense thrown in for good measure. </li>
<li>I have a hard time imagining <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2008/07/16/a-weekend-at-foo-camp.aspx">Pat Helland camping</a>. </li>
