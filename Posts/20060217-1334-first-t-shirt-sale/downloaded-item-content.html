<p>So I&#8217;ve already sold two of my <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/harrypierson*">new t-shirts</a>. Not quite enough to retire on, but it&#8217;s a start! <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group696" alt=":)"> </p>
<p>If nothing else, this has helped me realize just how popular Zazzle is. As I type this, my shirts are on page 20 of Zazzle&#8217;s <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/products/gallery/browse_results.asp?general_product_type=235">most recent shirt list</a>. That&#8217;s 304 new shirt designs since yesterday. That&#8217;s pretty impressive. </p>
