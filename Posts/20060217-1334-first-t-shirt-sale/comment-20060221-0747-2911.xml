  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, I found the T-Shirt delivery on my front porch as I was leaving to go to the SEASPIN meeting and David Anderson's presentation on the MSF Agile CMMI approach.  I was afraid of missing the bus, so I didn't wear it.  That would have been fun.

The cool thing is that the T-shirt shipped earlier than their promise and arrived a day earlier than the expected delivery as well.  It would be interesting to see how Zazzle works their just-in-time and delight the customer process so beautifully.

I'm still thinking about the model case for a T-shirt, and David's talk reminded me that I already have a design that would make for an interesting T-shirt at http://nfocentrale.net/TROST/info/2005/06/i050601.htm]]></wp:comment_content>
