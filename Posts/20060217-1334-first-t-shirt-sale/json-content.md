So I’ve already sold two of my [new
t-shirts](http://www.zazzle.com/harrypierson*). Not quite enough to
retire on, but it’s a start!
:smile:

If nothing else, this has helped me realize just how popular Zazzle is.
As I type this, my shirts are on page 20 of Zazzle’s [most recent shirt
list](http://www.zazzle.com/products/gallery/browse_results.asp?general_product_type=235).
That’s 304 new shirt designs since yesterday. That’s pretty impressive.
