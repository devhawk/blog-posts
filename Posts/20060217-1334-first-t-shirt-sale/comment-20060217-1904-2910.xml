  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I like your new site design too.  Although when I come to the comments page I get a "Caution: This website contains suspicious content" banner from the Phishing Filter."  

So, I just retrieved an e-mail from DHL Express confirming that the shirts were shipped today with estimated delivery of Tuesday (assuming the Menlo Park pickup came off as planned).

Hmm, modeling on a T-shirt.  I suppose so.  I was given one like that as a going-away present (in 1992 on taking a transfer to another organization) that has a printing-system architecture printed on it.  

Modeling.  That would be interesting. Now you've got me wondering what T-shirt I would want to wear at OOPSLA this year.  Hmm.  I need to do one that bridges between "What Computers Know" and "What Programmers Know," perhaps.]]></wp:comment_content>
