<p>So I've already sold two of my <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/harrypierson*">new t-shirts</a>. Not quite enough to retire on, but it's a start! :)</p><p>If nothing else, this has helped me realize just how popular Zazzle is. As I type this, my shirts are on page 20 of Zazzle's <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/products/gallery/browse_results.asp?general_product_type=235">most recent shirt list</a>. That's 304 new shirt designs since yesterday. That's pretty impressive. </p>
