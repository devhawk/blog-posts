I wanted to see how it worked under the hood, so I checked out the HTML source for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplegeek.com\/PermaLink.aspx\/5516e540-156a-4672-a804-54c21bedf5b7\">this page<\/a>. It includes around 115kb of XAML! We&#8217;ve seen ViewState and JavaScript page bloat, is XAML bloat next?\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.knowing.net\/PermaLink,guid,db319518-094a-4d77-b365-2b1b28b2aa38.aspx\">Larry O&#8217;Brien<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/ztrek.blogspot.com\/2007\/01\/presenting-threading-maturity-model.html\">Alan Zeichick<\/a> are talking about a Threading Maturity Model. Good ideas there, but frankly I think we need a language that recognizes concurrency as a first-order abstraction if we&#8217;re going to make much progress up the maturity model.\n<\/li>\n<li>Dare <a href=\"http:\/\/www.25hoursaday.com\/weblog\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=3e16e16a-fa4e-4cbf-b18f-ccd8d34eeba4\">recommends<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/programming.reddit.com\/\">programming.reddit.com<\/a>. Definitely worthy of a closer look.\n<\/li>\n<li>The BTS training I&#8217;m in yesterday and today is being held on Microsoft&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jobsblog\/archive\/2005\/07\/12\/438157.aspx\">Red West campus<\/a>, home of MSN &amp; Windows Live. It&#8217;s very nice looking and is a good size &#8211; five buildings &#8211; without being as huge as main campus. It even has a &#8220;ski-lodge&#8221; cafeteria, though given the slim pickings in my building&#8217;s cafe anything would be an improvement.\n<\/li>\n<li>One thing I don&#8217;t miss about working on campus is the commute. Getting to my office takes 20-30 minutes, depending on the traffic lights. Getting to campus, even though it&#8217;s physically closer, takes 45-60 minutes, most of it spent sitting still. Every time I wish we&#8217;d move to campus, I remember the traffic and decide I like where I am just fine.\n<\/li>\n<li>Two big learnings from BTS training yesterday:\n<ul>\n<li>Conceptually, BTS hasn&#8217;t changed much since the 2000\/2002 releases that I was more familiar with. In practice, it has heavily embraced .NET which is a good thing. I didn&#8217;t realize how much of a difference having tools like the pipeline and map editor inside VS would make, but it does. (I realize the orchestration editor is inside VS as well, but we get to that module of the class today).\n<\/li>\n<li>The MessageBox is a bigger deal than I remember or realized. <a href=\"http:\/\/pluralsight.com\/blogs\/matt\/\">Matt<\/a> called it the &#8220;heart of BizTalk&#8221;. I know BTS has had a SQL based message store since day one, but I don&#8217;t remember it being called out explicitly. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;ve <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/CommentView,guid,e7b99068-8f9b-47cd-b5d2-e09d5d250ccc.aspx#commentstart\">said before<\/a> that MessageBox is roughly analogous to SSB queues, though BTS wonks (like my teammates) typically jump down my throat when I do. MessageBox has a pub\/sub design philosophy which SSB does not. However, I&#8217;m guessing pub\/sub is used much more in messaging scenarios rather than orchestration scenarios. My efforts around SSB &amp; WF are much more focused on orchestration scenarios, so I&#8217;m guessing SSB&#8217;s lack of pub\/sub infrastructure is not a big deal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>According to Chris &#8220;Long Tail&#8221; Anderson (as opposed to Chris &#8220;Avalon Architect&#8221; Anderson), &#8220;Combined with the new low-cost distribution channels, from DVD to digital downloads, all you now need to be a filmmaker is talent.&#8221; Really?
