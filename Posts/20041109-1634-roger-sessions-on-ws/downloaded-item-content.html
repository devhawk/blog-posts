<p><a href="http://www.objectwatch.com/about_us.htm">Roger Sessions</a>, noted architectural guru, author and Microsoft Architect MVP, has posted his <a href="http://www.objectwatch.com/newsletters/ObjectWatchNewsletter048.pdf">latest newsletter</a> on the WS-* family of specs. In typical Roger fashion, he decides to give them his own name &#8211; WS-SCRAM with SCRAM standing for &#8220;Secure, Coordinated, Reliable Async Messages&#8221;. (I forget where, but I once heard Roger refer to &#8220;three-phase transactions&#8221; instead of the relatively standard &#8220;two-phase commit transactions&#8221;.) Roger claims MS et. al. are pushing WS-STAR where &#8220;STAR&#8221; is an acronym standing for &#8220;Secure, Transacted, Async, Reliable&#8221;. Personally, I&#8217;ve never seen it written out like a an acronym and I always thought the * in WS-* was used as a wildcard, but it is true that we are focused more on transactions than coordination. On the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn">Longhorn DevCenter</a>, Indigo is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/pillars/Indigo">described</a> as providing &#8220;secure, reliable, and transacted messaging along with interoperability.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is actually the second time Roger&#8217;s taken on transactions in a web services architecture. His <a href="http://www.objectwatch.com/newsletters/issue_41.htm">last newsletter</a> on the topic had a much more detailed but harder to follow example. He points out that there are two related specs in this space &#8211; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2004/10/ws-atomictransaction/">WS-AtomicTransaction</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2004/10/ws-businessactivity/">WS-BusinessActivity</a> but that he thinks only WS-BA is going to work in the long run. WS-AT requires holding locks open in the DB, which is highly unlikely between services in different trust boundaries communicating with async messaging. Am I really going to lock the records in my database while I wait for a service that I don&#8217;t trust to figure out if it is able to commit or abort? I don&#8217;t think so. Pat&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2004/08/12/213552.aspx">wrote a great scenario</a> showing how unrealistic the concept of long-running transactions really are.</p>
<p>However, at the end of the newsletter, Roger takes Indigo to task for implementing WS-AT and not WS-BA and I don&#8217;t agree with him. While I think WS-AT shouldn&#8217;t be used in web services architectures, Indigo is also responsible for moving existing technologies like COM+ forward. Leaving out WS-AT isn&#8217;t really an option in those scenarios. As for not implementing WS-BA, I&#8217;ve got to wonder just how valuable is WS-BA? While WS-BA avoids the DB locking issue of WS-AT, it still doesn&#8217;t deal with the delegation of control. WS-BA still leaves me beholden to the decision of some outside coordinator. This seems to violate two of <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox">Don&#8217;s</a><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/understanding/pillars/indigo/default.aspx?pull=/msdnmag/issues/04/01/Indigo/default.aspx">tenets of service orientation</a>: &#8220;Boundaries are Explicit&#8221; and &#8220;Services are Autonomous&#8221;.</p>
