In typical Roger fashion, he decides to give them his own name &#8211; WS-SCRAM with SCRAM standing for &#8220;Secure, Coordinated, Reliable Async Messages&#8221;. (I forget where, but I once heard Roger refer to &#8220;three-phase transactions&#8221; instead of the relatively standard &#8220;two-phase commit transactions&#8221;.) Roger claims MS et. al. are pushing WS-STAR where &#8220;STAR&#8221; is an acronym standing for &#8220;Secure, Transacted, Async, Reliable&#8221;. Personally, I&#8217;ve never seen it written out like a an acronym and I always thought the * in WS-* was used as a wildcard, but it is true that we are focused more on transactions than coordination. On the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/Longhorn\">Longhorn DevCenter<\/a>, Indigo is <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/Longhorn\/understanding\/pillars\/Indigo\">described<\/a> as providing &#8220;secure, reliable, and transacted messaging along with interoperability.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>This is actually the second time Roger&#8217;s taken on transactions in a web services architecture. His <a href=\"http:\/\/www.objectwatch.com\/newsletters\/issue_41.htm\">last newsletter<\/a> on the topic had a much more detailed but harder to follow example. He points out that there are two related specs in this space &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/ws\/2004\/10\/ws-atomictransaction\/\">WS-AtomicTransaction<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/ws\/2004\/10\/ws-businessactivity\/\">WS-BusinessActivity<\/a> but that he thinks only WS-BA is going to work in the long run. WS-AT requires holding locks open in the DB, which is highly unlikely between services in different trust boundaries communicating with async messaging. Am I really going to lock the records in my database while I wait for a service that I don&#8217;t trust to figure out if it is able to commit or abort? I don&#8217;t think so. Pat&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/pathelland\/archive\/2004\/08\/12\/213552.aspx\">wrote a great scenario<\/a> showing how unrealistic the concept of long-running transactions really are.<\/p>\n<p>However, at the end of the newsletter, Roger takes Indigo to task for implementing WS-AT and not WS-BA and I don&#8217;t agree with him. While I think WS-AT shouldn&#8217;t be used in web services architectures, Indigo is also responsible for moving existing technologies like COM+ forward. Leaving out WS-AT isn&#8217;t really an option in those scenarios. As for not implementing WS-BA, I&#8217;ve got to wonder just how valuable is WS-BA? While WS-BA avoids the DB locking issue of WS-AT, it still doesn&#8217;t deal with the delegation of control. WS-BA still leaves me beholden to the decision of some outside coordinator. This seems to violate two of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pluralsight.com\/blogs\/dbox\">Don&#8217;s<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/longhorn\/understanding\/pillars\/indigo\/default.aspx?pull=\/msdnmag\/issues\/04\/01\/Indigo\/default.aspx\">tenets of service orientation<\/a>: &#8220;Boundaries are Explicit&#8221; and &#8220;Services are Autonomous&#8221;.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Roger Sessions, noted architectural guru, author and Microsoft Architect MVP, has posted his latest newsletter on the WS-* family of specs.
