<p>So my time off ended a month ago, but I haven&#8217;t blogged significantly in over two months. New kid + new job + new house will do that to you. However, I spent the time this morning upgrading DevHawk to the new 1.8 version of <a href="http://wiki.shahine.com/default.aspx/DasBlog/homepage.html">dasBlog</a> and I&#8217;m ready to jump back in. </p>
<p>Back when I was still on leave, my new boss <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John deVadoss</a> this to say about my new job:</p>
<blockquote><div>Our current thinking is that Harry will focus on two top-level areas</div>
<ol>
<li>Being the storyteller (Metropolis, Connected Systems etc)
</li>
<li>Changing the way we evangelize Architecture &#8211; its not all about n-dimensional frameworks, with m layers of abstraction, about perspectives and viewpoints, with n-layers of capability mappings, and enterprise frameworks&nbsp;up and down the wazooo, blah blah blah. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I loved #2. Architecture is such different things to different people (more on that later) but I thought John&#8217;s description about what it&#8217;s <i>not</i> all about was priceless.</p>
