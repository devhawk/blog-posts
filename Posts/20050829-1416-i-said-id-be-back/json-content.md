So my time off ended a month ago, but I haven’t blogged significantly in
over two months. New kid + new job + new house will do that to you.
However, I spent the time this morning upgrading DevHawk to the new 1.8
version of
[dasBlog](http://wiki.shahine.com/default.aspx/DasBlog/homepage.html)
and I’m ready to jump back in.

Back when I was still on leave, my new boss [John
deVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/) this to say about my new job:

> <div>
>
> Our current thinking is that Harry will focus on two top-level areas
>
> </div>
>
> 1.  Being the storyteller (Metropolis, Connected Systems etc)
> 2.  Changing the way we evangelize Architecture – its not all about
>     n-dimensional frameworks, with m layers of abstraction, about
>     perspectives and viewpoints, with n-layers of capability mappings,
>     and enterprise frameworks up and down the wazooo, blah blah blah.

I loved \#2. Architecture is such different things to different people
(more on that later) but I thought John’s description about what it’s
*not* all about was priceless.
