I understand Sam&#8217;s feelings 100%. I maintained <a title=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/devhawk\/\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/devhawk\/\">blogs.msdn.com\/devhawk<\/a>\u00a0for these exactly these reasons. But since I&#8217;m no longer an evangelist (or MVP, natch) and my blog no longer graces the pages of the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/architecture\">MSDN Architecture Center<\/a>, I don&#8217;t bother to provide a dev-centric, politically sanitized and work safe version of this blog. As I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2004\/10\/14\/Waking+Up.aspx\">wrote several years ago<\/a>\u00a0that DevHawk is not a technical blog, it&#8217;s my personal blog. Like Sam, I don&#8217;t get paid to write it\u00a0and if you don&#8217;t want to put up with <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/CategoryView,category,Politics.aspx\">my politics<\/a> to get <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/CategoryView,category,Architecture.aspx\">my architecture insights<\/a>, you&#8217;re free to unsubscribe.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Sam, if you&#8217;re reading this,\u00a0I suggest that you have one &#8220;master&#8221; blog and one &#8220;sanitized&#8221; blog, rather than two independent ones. I&#8217;ve tried having two separate blogs, but one always suffered. My rationale was always that there is only one &#8220;me&#8221; and I wanted once place that reflects the things I am passionate about. If I felt a specific post needed to be sanitized for whatever reason (too personal, too vulgar, not technical, etc.) I would simply choose to not cross post it to my MSDN blog. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Sam Gentile decided to spawn a new blog because he doesn&#8217;t feel his CodeBetter blog is the place to write about &#8220;politics, music, family or life in general&#8221;.
