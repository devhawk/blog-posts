<p>Sam Gentile decided to spawn a <a href="http://web.mac.com/fusionclr/iWeb/Sam%20Gentile%20Personal%20Site/Blog/Blog.html">new blog</a> because <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/04/01/New-Personal_2C00_-Family-and-MAC-Site-and-Blog.aspx">he doesn&#8217;t feel his CodeBetter blog</a> is the place to write about &#8220;politics, music, family or life in general&#8221;. I understand Sam&#8217;s feelings 100%. I maintained <a title="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk/" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk/">blogs.msdn.com/devhawk</a>&nbsp;for these exactly these reasons. But since I&#8217;m no longer an evangelist (or MVP, natch) and my blog no longer graces the pages of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/architecture">MSDN Architecture Center</a>, I don&#8217;t bother to provide a dev-centric, politically sanitized and work safe version of this blog. As I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/10/14/Waking+Up.aspx">wrote several years ago</a>&nbsp;that DevHawk is not a technical blog, it&#8217;s my personal blog. Like Sam, I don&#8217;t get paid to write it&nbsp;and if you don&#8217;t want to put up with <a href="http://devhawk.net/CategoryView,category,Politics.aspx">my politics</a> to get <a href="http://devhawk.net/CategoryView,category,Architecture.aspx">my architecture insights</a>, you&#8217;re free to unsubscribe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam, if you&#8217;re reading this,&nbsp;I suggest that you have one &#8220;master&#8221; blog and one &#8220;sanitized&#8221; blog, rather than two independent ones. I&#8217;ve tried having two separate blogs, but one always suffered. My rationale was always that there is only one &#8220;me&#8221; and I wanted once place that reflects the things I am passionate about. If I felt a specific post needed to be sanitized for whatever reason (too personal, too vulgar, not technical, etc.) I would simply choose to not cross post it to my MSDN blog. </p>
