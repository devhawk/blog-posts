Added a link to the <a href="http://www.sscli.net/">Rotor Community Site</a>. Haven't had a chance for much spelunking, but it looks cool. Currently offers the <a href="http://sharedsourcecli.sscli.net/">SSCLI</a> and an <a href="http://cli-grande.sscli.net/">HPC</a> project up there for participation.
