<p>I started reading <a href="http://www.thenears.com/">The Nears</a> after <a href="http://blog.seanalexander.com/">Sean</a> linked to his <a href="http://www.thenears.com/index.php?p=80">comparison</a> of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/evaluation/devices/default.mspx">Media Center Extenders</a>. Today, there&#8217;s a great comparison of Media Center Extenders to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/devices/wmconnect/default.aspx">Windows Media Connect</a> devices. Very cool stuff. I&#8217;d love to have all my media on a central machine and then be able to listen to or watch it all over the house. The Nears linked to the <a href="http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/index.php">Roku SoundBridge</a> which plugs into your stereo system. Supports wired or 802.11b/g wireless in as well as analog, optical and coax audio out. Controllable via remote control or web app. Of course, what would be truly killer is web services support. Prices seem pretty reasonable. There are <a href="http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/models.php">three different models</a> with the same functionality &#8211; the only difference is the size and quality of the display.&nbsp;I think I need one or two of these&#8230;</p>
