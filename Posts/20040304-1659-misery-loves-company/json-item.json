Also, the annual <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seattlethunderbirds.com\/events\/mshc.html\">Microsoft Hockey Challenge<\/a> is next weekend. Traditionally, we played rival IT companies like Sun and AOL, thrashing them soundly on the ice (the one time I went, we been Sun 8-1). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seattlethunderbirds.com\/events\/mshc.html#sched\">This year<\/a>, there are a variety of intra-MSFT games and a series of MSFT vs. Customer games, but no industry rivalry games.
