  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dude, I was with you when the Sun ass-whuppin' was dealt out to Sun, wasn't I?

I think Sun filed some sort of law suit against Microsoft after that game, didn't they?  I think they said MS used unfair practices to beat them, and that MS had a monopoly on Hockey, and that MS was generally not nice to them, and that MS... oh, wait a second - I forgot, that wasn't about Hockey, was it?  Guess you guys have beaten them in at least two arenas now!

For those that haven't been, the MS Hockey Challenge is a great time, and it benefits a great charity, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Western Washington.  Take a friend, see some cool hockey, buy one of the very cool T-Shirts and support a great cause while you're at it.
