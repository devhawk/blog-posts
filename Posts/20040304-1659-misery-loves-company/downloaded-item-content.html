<p>Fellow &#8216;softie and Washington Caps fan <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/">Dan Fernandez</a><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/03/01/82415.aspx">feels my pain</a>. I called my father the other day and chirped: &#8220;Any new ex-Caps today?&#8221; and was very depressed to hear &#8220;Yeah, Gonchar&#8217;s gone&#8221;. I know I SAID&nbsp;my favorite&nbsp;Caps were on one way tickets out of town, but it&#8217;s depressing to be&nbsp;right. Between the fire sale and the upcoming CBA quagmire, I wonder if the Caps will sell ANY season tickets for next year. </p>
<p>I have a coworker who used to work for AOL in general and Ted &#8220;Hockey Abomination&#8221; Leonsis in particular. He&#8217;s watched a game from the owner box. I told him to give Ted a message for me : &#8220;Sell the Team&#8221;. Of course, I&#8217;m guessing he&#8217;s hearing that message on several fronts these days.</p>
<p>Update: Raymond Chen <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/02/82721.aspx">enjoyed</a> a Seattle Thunderbirds game recently. Also, the annual <a href="http://www.seattlethunderbirds.com/events/mshc.html">Microsoft Hockey Challenge</a> is next weekend. Traditionally, we played rival IT companies like Sun and AOL, thrashing them soundly on the ice (the one time I went, we been Sun 8-1). <a href="http://www.seattlethunderbirds.com/events/mshc.html#sched">This year</a>, there are a variety of intra-MSFT games and a series of MSFT vs. Customer games, but no industry rivalry games. Bummer!</p>
