Fellow ‘softie and Washington Caps fan [Dan
Fernandez](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/)[feels my
pain](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2004/03/01/82415.aspx). I
called my father the other day and chirped: “Any new ex-Caps today?” and
was very depressed to hear “Yeah, Gonchar’s gone”. I know I SAID my
favorite Caps were on one way tickets out of town, but it’s depressing
to be right. Between the fire sale and the upcoming CBA quagmire, I
wonder if the Caps will sell ANY season tickets for next year.

I have a coworker who used to work for AOL in general and Ted “Hockey
Abomination” Leonsis in particular. He’s watched a game from the owner
box. I told him to give Ted a message for me : “Sell the Team”. Of
course, I’m guessing he’s hearing that message on several fronts these
days.

a Seattle Thunderbirds game recently. Also, the annual [Microsoft Hockey
Challenge](http://www.seattlethunderbirds.com/events/mshc.html) is next
weekend. Traditionally, we played rival IT companies like Sun and AOL,
thrashing them soundly on the ice (the one time I went, we been Sun
8-1). [This
year](http://www.seattlethunderbirds.com/events/mshc.html#sched), there
are a variety of intra-MSFT games and a series of MSFT vs. Customer
games, but no industry rivalry games. Bummer!
