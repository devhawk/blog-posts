The big treat was his cousin Jack coming up for a visit. Here's a picture of the two of them at Patrick's party on Saturday. My wife has <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!2040.entry">all the details</a> on her blog. Update: My wife just <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!2065.entry">posted a whole slew</a> of Early Patrick Pictures.  </li><li>If my son is five, it means this blog is also five - I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/01/15/New+And+Improved+DevHawk.aspx">started this blog</a> about a month before <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/02/23/Welcome+Patrick.aspx">Patrick was born</a>. I never remember to mark the occasion until Paddy boy's big day comes around.  </li><li>Major props to the House of Representatives for growing a backbone and <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Bush_I_will_not_accept_any_0213.html">not caving</a> to President 30% Approval on telecom immunity...yet. Personally, I'd like to see the House bury the measure completely, though I'm not holding my breath. But given that even the right-wing Washington Times reports "<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080216/NATION/847451166/1002">Analysts say FISA will suffice</a>", maybe the House Dems will do the right thing.  </li><li>After tearing it up since Thanksgiving, the Caps have gone a little cold. 5-4-1 in their last ten and 2-2-1 in their last five. In the month of February, they're 1-3-1 against SE division opponents. Good news is that they're still even with Carolina (two points behind with two games in hand), half a game up on Atlanta, a game and a half up on Florida and two and a half games up on Tampa Bay.  </li><li>Bill Gates <a href="http://channel8.msdn.com/Posts/2047/">announced</a> a new program called <a href="https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/">DreamSpark</a> to provide college students access to all of Microsoft's developer and designer tools, including Visual Studio, Expression, SQL Server, Windows Server and XNA Creators Club membership. This looks like an outgrowth of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/academic/default.aspx">MSDN Academic Alliance</a> program. I think it's a great idea. Update: Looks like <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_8302312">high-school students</a> will be able to access the DreamSpark program too. However, since they're minors, they have to get the software via their teachers.

Of the five winners, <a href="http://www.strandyfamily.com/Specimen/">Specimen</a> looks the coolest to me. I wish I had more time to get into game development.

Xbox Live VP John Schappert is giving a <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/conference/keynotes.htm">keynote</a> on "Unleashing the Creative Community". XNA GM Chris Satchell <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16618">said last year</a> they would "announce full details on, and ... vision for, opening XNA creations to the community" sometime this year. I'm guessing this is said announcement.  </li><li>Speaking of Xbox, there's a <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23214808/">rumor</a> that Microsoft and Netflix will announce this week that Netflix is bringing their Watch Instantly service to Xbox 360. If true, sign me up!  </li><li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/default.aspx">Grigori Melnik</a> announces the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/02/15/gax-gat-february-2008-final-release.aspx">GAX/GAT February 2008 final release</a>. Key feature is VS08 support. Is it just me, or does calling it the "final release" make it sound like they won't be upgrading GAX/GAT further?  </li><li>Speaking of p&amp;p, Grigori also announces the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/02/12/unity-february-2008-community-technology-preview.aspx">Feb 2008 CTP of Unity</a>, p&amp;p's new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control">IoC</a> container. I've seem lots of folks echoing the announcement, but not much in the way of specifics on Unity itself. For example, Chris Brandsma <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2008/02/17/microsoft-releases-unity-an-ioc-library/">describes IoC and mentions Unity</a>, but he doesn't cover any Unity specifics. :(  </li><li>MSIT EA Nilesh Bhide has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nileshb">started blogging</a>. His first post is on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nileshb/archive/2008/01/29/customer-perception-of-service-quality-in-s-s-saas.aspx">Customer perception of Service Quality in S+S/SaaS</a>. I've worked closely with Nilesh in the past two years, so I'm excited to see him take to the blogosphere.

As Charlie Calvert <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/01/28/code-gallery-goes-live-new-site-for-samples.aspx">explained</a>, this is logical successor to GotDotNet's user samples area. Between Code Gallery and <a href="http://codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>, GotDotNet has finally been shuttered for good.  </li><li>Telligent, makers of the very popular <a href="http://communityserver.org/">Community Server</a>, have released <a href="http://graffiticms.com/">Graffiti CMS</a>, which looks like a more flexible content platform than Community Server. (via <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/products/Graffiti_1_0_Released">DNK</a>)  </li><li>In somewhat unexpected news (at least, unexpected by me) Microsoft has released specs for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx">Office <em>binary </em>file formats</a>. I'm not sure why this is happening now, rather than say when we released the specs for the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/news/TC45_current_work/TC45_available_docs.htm">Open Office XML file formats</a>.
