	:::
    The big treat was his cousin Jack
    coming up for a visit. Here’s a picture of the two of them at
    Patrick’s party on Saturday. My wife has [all the
    details](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!2040.entry)
    on her blog. **Update**: My wife just [posted a whole
    slew](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!2065.entry)
    of Early Patrick Pictures.
-   If my son is five, it means this blog is also five – I [started this
    blog](http://devhawk.net/2003/01/14/new-and-improved-devhawk/)
    about a month before [Patrick was
    born](http://devhawk.net/2003/02/23/welcome-patrick/). I never
    remember to mark the occasion until Paddy boy’s big day comes
    around.
-   Major props to the House of Representatives for growing a backbone
    and [not
    caving](http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Bush_I_will_not_accept_any_0213.html)
    to President 30% Approval on telecom immunity…yet. Personally, I’d
    like to see the House bury the measure completely, though I’m not
    holding my breath. But given that even the right-wing Washington
    Times reports “[Analysts say FISA will
    suffice](http://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080216/NATION/847451166/1002)“,
    maybe the House Dems will do the right thing.
-   After tearing it up since Thanksgiving, the Caps have gone a little
    cold. 5-4-1 in their last ten and 2-2-1 in their last five. In the
    month of February, they’re 1-3-1 against SE division opponents. Good
    news is that they’re still even with Carolina (two points behind
    with two games in hand), half a game up on Atlanta, a game and a
    half up on Florida and two and a half games up on Tampa Bay.
-   Bill Gates [announced](http://channel8.msdn.com/Posts/2047/) a new
    program called [DreamSpark](https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/) to
    provide college students access to all of Microsoft’s developer and
    designer tools, including Visual Studio, Expression, SQL Server,
    Windows Server and XNA Creators Club membership. This looks like an
    outgrowth of the [MSDN Academic
    Alliance](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/academic/default.aspx)
    program. I think it’s a great idea. **Update**: Looks like [high-school
    students](http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_8302312) will be able to
    access the DreamSpark program too. However, since they’re minors,
    they have to get the software via their teachers. (via

-   The winners of the [XNA Silicon Minds
    contest](http://dreambuildplay.com/main/winners.aspx) have been
    announced. Of the five winners,
    [Specimen](http://www.strandyfamily.com/Specimen/) looks the coolest
    to me. I wish I had more time to get into game development. (Via

-   Speaking of game development, this week is the [Game Development
    Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/), so be on the lookout for lots
    of game-related news. Xbox Live VP John Schappert is giving a
    [keynote](http://www.gdconf.com/conference/keynotes.htm) on
    “Unleashing the Creative Community”. XNA GM Chris Satchell [said
    last
    year](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16618)
    they would “announce full details on, and … vision for, opening XNA
    creations to the community” sometime this year. I’m guessing this is
    said announcement.
-   Speaking of Xbox, there’s a
    [rumor](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23214808/) that Microsoft and
    Netflix will announce this week that Netflix is bringing their Watch
    Instantly service to Xbox 360. If true, sign me up!
-   [Grigori Melnik](http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/default.aspx) announces
    the [GAX/GAT February 2008 final
    release](http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/02/15/gax-gat-february-2008-final-release.aspx).
    Key feature is VS08 support. Is it just me, or does calling it the
    “final release” make it sound like they won’t be upgrading GAX/GAT
    further?
-   Speaking of p&p, Grigori also announces the [Feb 2008 CTP of
    Unity](http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/02/12/unity-february-2008-community-technology-preview.aspx),
    p&p’s new [IoC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control)
    container. I’ve seem lots of folks echoing the announcement, but not
    much in the way of specifics on Unity itself. For example, Chris
    Brandsma [describes IoC and mentions
    Unity](http://elegantcode.com/2008/02/17/microsoft-releases-unity-an-ioc-library/),
    but he doesn’t cover any Unity specifics.
    :frowning:
-   MSIT EA Nilesh Bhide has [started
    blogging](http://blogs.msdn.com/nileshb). His first post is on
    [Customer perception of Service Quality in
    S+S/SaaS](http://blogs.msdn.com/nileshb/archive/2008/01/29/customer-perception-of-service-quality-in-s-s-saas.aspx).
    I’ve worked closely with Nilesh in the past two years, so I’m
    excited to see him take to the blogosphere. (via [Nick
    Malik](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2008/02/13/want-the-software-quality-attributes-of-a-service-ask-the-customer.aspx))
-   I don’t know how I missed it, but the [MSDN Code
    Gallery](http://code.msdn.com/) launched last month. As Charlie
    Calvert
    [explained](http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/01/28/code-gallery-goes-live-new-site-for-samples.aspx),
    this is logical successor to GotDotNet’s user samples area. Between
    Code Gallery and [CodePlex](http://codeplex.com/), GotDotNet has
    finally been shuttered for good.
-   Telligent, makers of the very popular [Community
    Server](http://communityserver.org/), have released [Graffiti
    CMS](http://graffiticms.com/), which looks like a more flexible
    content platform than Community Server. (via
    [DNK](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/products/Graffiti_1_0_Released))
-   In somewhat unexpected news (at least, unexpected by me) Microsoft
    has released specs for the [Office *binary* file
    formats](http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx).
    I’m not sure why this is happening now, rather than say when we
    released the specs for the [Open Office XML file
    formats](http://www.ecma-international.org/news/TC45_current_work/TC45_available_docs.htm).
