The big treat was his cousin Jack coming up for a visit. Here&#8217;s a picture of the two of them at Patrick&#8217;s party on Saturday. My wife has <a href=\"http:\/\/techiewife.spaces.live.com\/blog\/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!2040.entry\">all the details<\/a> on her blog. Update: My wife just <a href=\"http:\/\/techiewife.spaces.live.com\/Blog\/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!2065.entry\">posted a whole slew<\/a> of Early Patrick Pictures.  <\/li>\n<li>If my son is five, it means this blog is also five &#8211; I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2003\/01\/15\/New+And+Improved+DevHawk.aspx\">started this blog<\/a> about a month before <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2003\/02\/23\/Welcome+Patrick.aspx\">Patrick was born<\/a>. I never remember to mark the occasion until Paddy boy&#8217;s big day comes around.  <\/li>\n<li>Major props to the House of Representatives for growing a backbone and <a href=\"http:\/\/rawstory.com\/news\/2008\/Bush_I_will_not_accept_any_0213.html\">not caving<\/a> to President 30% Approval on telecom immunity&#8230;yet. Personally, I&#8217;d like to see the House bury the measure completely, though I&#8217;m not holding my breath. But given that even the right-wing Washington Times reports &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/apps\/pbcs.dll\/article?AID=\/20080216\/NATION\/847451166\/1002\">Analysts say FISA will suffice<\/a>&#8220;, maybe the House Dems will do the right thing.  <\/li>\n<li>After tearing it up since Thanksgiving, the Caps have gone a little cold. 5-4-1 in their last ten and 2-2-1 in their last five. In the month of February, they&#8217;re 1-3-1 against SE division opponents. Good news is that they&#8217;re still even with Carolina (two points behind with two games in hand), half a game up on Atlanta, a game and a half up on Florida and two and a half games up on Tampa Bay.  <\/li>\n<li>Bill Gates <a href=\"http:\/\/channel8.msdn.com\/Posts\/2047\/\">announced<\/a> a new program called <a href=\"https:\/\/downloads.channel8.msdn.com\/\">DreamSpark<\/a> to provide college students access to all of Microsoft&#8217;s developer and designer tools, including Visual Studio, Expression, SQL Server, Windows Server and XNA Creators Club membership. This looks like an outgrowth of the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/academic\/default.aspx\">MSDN Academic Alliance<\/a> program. I think it&#8217;s a great idea. Update: Looks like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/ci_8302312\">high-school students<\/a> will be able to access the DreamSpark program too. However, since they&#8217;re minors, they have to get the software via their teachers.

Of the five winners, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.strandyfamily.com\/Specimen\/\">Specimen<\/a> looks the coolest to me. I wish I had more time to get into game development.

Xbox Live VP John Schappert is giving a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gdconf.com\/conference\/keynotes.htm\">keynote<\/a> on &#8220;Unleashing the Creative Community&#8221;. XNA GM Chris Satchell <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gamasutra.com\/php-bin\/news_index.php?story=16618\">said last year<\/a> they would &#8220;announce full details on, and &#8230; vision for, opening XNA creations to the community&#8221; sometime this year. I&#8217;m guessing this is said announcement.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Xbox, there&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/23214808\/\">rumor<\/a> that Microsoft and Netflix will announce this week that Netflix is bringing their Watch Instantly service to Xbox 360. If true, sign me up!  <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/agile\/default.aspx\">Grigori Melnik<\/a> announces the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/agile\/archive\/2008\/02\/15\/gax-gat-february-2008-final-release.aspx\">GAX\/GAT February 2008 final release<\/a>. Key feature is VS08 support. Is it just me, or does calling it the &#8220;final release&#8221; make it sound like they won&#8217;t be upgrading GAX\/GAT further?  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of p&amp;p, Grigori also announces the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/agile\/archive\/2008\/02\/12\/unity-february-2008-community-technology-preview.aspx\">Feb 2008 CTP of Unity<\/a>, p&amp;p&#8217;s new <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inversion_of_Control\">IoC<\/a> container. I&#8217;ve seem lots of folks echoing the announcement, but not much in the way of specifics on Unity itself. For example, Chris Brandsma <a href=\"http:\/\/elegantcode.com\/2008\/02\/17\/microsoft-releases-unity-an-ioc-library\/\">describes IoC and mentions Unity<\/a>, but he doesn&#8217;t cover any Unity specifics. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_sad.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1104\" alt=\":(\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/>   <\/li>\n<li>MSIT EA Nilesh Bhide has <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/nileshb\">started blogging<\/a>.
