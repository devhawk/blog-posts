The basic idea is that when you&#8217;re stuck on a problem, you explain it <u>out loud<\/u> to an inanimate object &#8211; aka the rubber duck. (though when I originally heard about this practice, it was a teddy bear.) Maybe instgead of Coding Mindfully, we should be Coding Out Loud?  <\/li>\n<li>Quick side note to the previous bullet: I have often worked thru a problem by explaining it to <a href=\"http:\/\/techiewife.spaces.life.com\">my wife<\/a> who, like Scott&#8217;s wife, nods in all the right places, but cares not about such things. But calling your wife a rubber duck is bad for your health, so I&#8217;d rather call it Coding Out Loud.  <\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m a couple weeks behind on this, but Microsoft along with BEA, BMC, Cisco, Dell, EMC, HP, IBM, Intel, and Sun <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/Submission\/2007\/01\/\">submitted<\/a> the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/business\/dsi\/serviceml.mspx\">Service Modeling Language<\/a> to the W3C. For those not plauing along at home, SML is the new name for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/business\/dsi\/sdmwp.mspx\">System Definition Model<\/a> and is a core deliverable of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/business\/dsi\/\">Dynamic System Initiative<\/a>. Good to see it&#8217;s gotten such broad support for this. <\/li>\n<li>Jezz Santos and Edward Baker wrote a series of posts entitled &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jezzsa\/archive\/2007\/01\/25\/factories-201.aspx\">Factories 201<\/a>&#8220;. The entire series is good, but I particularly liked Jezz&#8217; post <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jezzsa\/archive\/2007\/02\/02\/factories-201-how-long-will-it-take.aspx\">How Long Will It Take?<\/a>\u00a0His rough estimate is that it takes at least five products built with a software factory before you recoup your investment in building the factory itself. Sounds like a fair assumption. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Scott Hanselman&#8217;s post on Mindful Coding reminded me of the practice of rubberducking.
