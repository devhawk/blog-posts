-   Scott Hanselman’s post on [Mindful
    Coding](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProgrammersKeepYourWitsAboutYouAndCodeMindfully.aspx)
    reminded me of the practice of
    [rubberducking](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking). The basic
    idea is that when you’re stuck on a problem, you explain it out loud
    to an inanimate object – aka the rubber duck. (though when I
    originally heard about this practice, it was a teddy bear.) Maybe
    instgead of Coding Mindfully, we should be Coding Out Loud?
-   Quick side note to the previous bullet: I have often worked thru a
    problem by explaining it to [my
    wife](http://techiewife.spaces.life.com) who, like Scott’s wife,
    nods in all the right places, but cares not about such things. But
    calling your wife a rubber duck is bad for your health, so I’d
    rather call it Coding Out Loud.
-   I’m a couple weeks behind on this, but Microsoft along with BEA,
    BMC, Cisco, Dell, EMC, HP, IBM, Intel, and Sun
    [submitted](http://www.w3.org/Submission/2007/01/) the [Service
    Modeling
    Language](http://www.microsoft.com/business/dsi/serviceml.mspx) to
    the W3C. For those not plauing along at home, SML is the new name
    for the [System Definition
    Model](http://www.microsoft.com/business/dsi/sdmwp.mspx) and is a
    core deliverable of the [Dynamic System
    Initiative](http://www.microsoft.com/business/dsi/). Good to see
    it’s gotten such broad support for this.
-   Jezz Santos and Edward Baker wrote a series of posts entitled
    “[Factories
    201](http://blogs.msdn.com/jezzsa/archive/2007/01/25/factories-201.aspx)“.
    The entire series is good, but I particularly liked Jezz’ post [How
    Long Will It
    Take?](http://blogs.msdn.com/jezzsa/archive/2007/02/02/factories-201-how-long-will-it-take.aspx) His
    rough estimate is that it takes at least five products built with a
    software factory before you recoup your investment in building the
    factory itself. Sounds like a fair assumption.
