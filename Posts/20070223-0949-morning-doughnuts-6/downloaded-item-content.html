<li>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/home/us"><font color="#669966">Wall Street Journal</font></a> is reporting that Massachusetts lawmakers are considering a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117211275783215723.html?mod=todays_us_marketplace"><font color="#669966">bill</font></a> to punish retailers for leaks in personal data. I wonder how long it will take for a law like that to go nationwide? Looks like there may be some good jobs in retail IT data security opening up shortly.

<li>There is an interesting <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/webservices/197006946"><font color="#669966">debate</font></a> on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/serviceproviders/saas/default.mspx"><font color="#669966">SAAS</font></a> architecture&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ddj.com/"><font color="#669966">Dr. Dobb&#8217;s Portal</font></a>. The money quote for me was as follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ajax and Web 2.0 are great technologies for casual use, but for mission critical you need the capabilities of a desktop app,&#8221; RightNow CEO Greg Gianforte says.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I have to admit I don&#8217;t agree with that quote at all. It seems pretty shortsighted in minimizing the capabilities of web based applications.</p>

He makes pretty good arguments for an against a SOA requiring web services and ultimately doesn&#8217;t answer the question. I would say that a SOA doesn&#8217;t require web services, but it is very likely in the range of 90% plus that a SOA within a company is going to have at least some web services in it.

<li>Harry returns from his secret mission and will be back blogging on Monday. I have really enjoyed stepping in being a replacement blogger this week. While my take on technology is a bit different that Harry&#8217;s I hope that my entries were interesting and offered a bit of a different perspective on IT.</li>
