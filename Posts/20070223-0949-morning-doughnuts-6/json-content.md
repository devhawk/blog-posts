-   The [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/home/us) is
    reporting that Massachusetts lawmakers are considering a
    [bill](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117211275783215723.html?mod=todays_us_marketplace)
    to punish retailers for leaks in personal data. I wonder how long it
    will take for a law like that to go nationwide? Looks like there may
    be some good jobs in retail IT data security opening up shortly.
-   There is an interesting
    [debate](http://www.ddj.com/dept/webservices/197006946) on the
    [SAAS](http://www.microsoft.com/serviceproviders/saas/default.mspx)
    architecture in [Dr. Dobb’s Portal](http://www.ddj.com/). The money
    quote for me was as follows:

> “Ajax and Web 2.0 are great technologies for casual use, but for
> mission critical you need the capabilities of a desktop app,” RightNow
> CEO Greg Gianforte says.

> I have to admit I don’t agree with that quote at all. It seems pretty
> shortsighted in minimizing the capabilities of web based applications.

-   As a follow-up to yesterdays
    [entry](http://devhawk.net/2007/02/22/Morning+Doughnuts+5.aspx)
    about the 12 steps to overcome [email
    addiction](http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/02/20/email.addiction.steps.reut/index.html)[here](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!300.entry)
    is a 12 step program to help you overcome being a SOAholic. There
    are also some symptoms you can look for to see if you are a
    [SOAholic](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!271.entry).

    on if SOA requires web services. He makes pretty good arguments for
    an against a SOA requiring web services and ultimately doesn’t
    answer the question. I would say that a SOA doesn’t require web
    services, but it is very likely in the range of 90% plus that a SOA
    within a company is going to have at least some web services in it.
-   Harry returns from his secret mission and will be back blogging on
    Monday. I have really enjoyed stepping in being a replacement
    blogger this week. While my take on technology is a bit different
    that Harry’s I hope that my entries were interesting and offered a
    bit of a different perspective on IT.
