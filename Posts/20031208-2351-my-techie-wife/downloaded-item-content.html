<p>It may not be <a href="http://www.gazitt.com/OhmBlog/PermaLink.aspx/8e32c6e4-02cd-4eea-91a9-e81b4058ff64">original anymore</a>, but I set up a <a href="http://techiewife.com/">weblog for my wife Julianne</a>. She&#8217;s always sending email out to all our friends with updates about our son, her job and other general goings-on, so I thought writing a weblog would be a good way for her to keep everyone up to date. She picked the name TechieWife in order to inspire the wives of techno-geeks everywhere. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group243" alt=":)"> </p>
<p>I noticed she got the address of my weblog wrong in her inaugural entry. What&#8217;s funny is that my friend Chris Church (no weblog yet) is so lazy that he bought <a href="http://devhawk.com/">devhawk.com</a> and set it to redirect to <a href="http://devhawk.net/">devhawk.net</a>. Now he can use IE&#8217;s ctrl-enter shortcut key to get to my weblog.</p>
