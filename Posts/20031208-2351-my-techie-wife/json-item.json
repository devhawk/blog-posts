She&#8217;s always sending email out to all our friends with updates about our son, her job and other general goings-on, so I thought writing a weblog would be a good way for her to keep everyone up to date. She picked the name TechieWife in order to inspire the wives of techno-geeks everywhere. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group243\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>I noticed she got the address of my weblog wrong in her inaugural entry. What&#8217;s funny is that my friend Chris Church (no weblog yet) is so lazy that he bought <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.com\/\">devhawk.com<\/a> and set it to redirect to <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/\">devhawk.net<\/a>. Now he can use IE&#8217;s ctrl-enter shortcut key to get to my weblog.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>It may not be original anymore, but I set up a weblog for my wife Julianne.
