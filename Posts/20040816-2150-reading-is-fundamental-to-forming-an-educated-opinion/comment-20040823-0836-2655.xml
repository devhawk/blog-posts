  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with Justin;  we're all supposedly "intelligent" people (God knows the average SlashDot fanboy claims to be incredibly moreso than the average bear) who can read without a lot of handholding.

I've been following and reading up on the concepts of software factories and totally get it and why it needs to happen, as I've witnessed too many reinventions of the wheel and far too little uptake of practices that would enable a good number of small and medium-sized software shops to punch well above their weight.

Bravo for supporting and helping champion the ideas.]]></wp:comment_content>
