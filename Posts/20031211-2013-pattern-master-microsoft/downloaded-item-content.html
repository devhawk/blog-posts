<p>I&#8217;m supposed to be on vacation, but it doesn&#8217;t look like this news has hit the blogosphere. <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>,&nbsp;inventor of the Wiki and general pattern wonk,&nbsp;has joined Microsoft. He&#8217;s got a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TipsForWardAtMicrosoft">wiki page</a> up for tips. I got to meet him on Tuesday and promised not to blog his arrival until he posted it on his site. Welcome Ward! I&#8217;ll be doing some very cool things with him, but more on that later. In the meantime, check out <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/Tsp/default.aspx">Testing Software Patterns</a> on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx">MSDN Architecture Center</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of wikis, the source code <a href="http://www.flexwiki.com">FlexWiki</a>, another .NET based wiki, is available online. I need to dig thru FlexWiki to see if having <a href="http://www.devhawk.net/prj_wiki.aspx">DevHawk Wiki</a> around anymore makes any sense.</p>
