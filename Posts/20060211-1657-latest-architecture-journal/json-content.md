It’s been a while coming, but the print subscriptions of [The
Architecture Journal](http://architecturejournal.net) are underway. I
got my copy of Journal 6 in the mail today. It’s not online yet, but you
can get the [back issues](http://architecturejournal.net/2005/issue4/)
and sign up for your [own free print
subscription](https://www.msarchitecturejournal.com) on the website.
