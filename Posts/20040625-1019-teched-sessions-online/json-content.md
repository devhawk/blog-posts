Streaming producer presenations from TechEd US have been posted.
However, the streaming presenation site has the same
[lack-of-url-addressability](http://devhawk.net/2004/03/04/url-addressability/)
issue that TechEd Breakout session list had. Is it so hard to just post
a simple HTML file with a list of all the sessions in a track? \<sigh\>

Anyway, here are links to the top 5 sessions from this year’s
architecture track. For those who could not make it to TechEd (or were
there, but missed these sessions) enjoy!

1.  Realizing SOA by [John deVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados) &
    [Ron Jacobs](http://blogs.msdn.com/RJacobs/)
2.  Data in SOA by Harry Pierson (i.e. yours truly)
3.  Patterns in the Enterprise by [Gregor
    Hohpe](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings.html)
4.  Improving Application Perf & Scale by [Chris
    Kinsman](http://www.vergentsoftware.com/blogs/ckinsman/)
5.  Building Apps with P&P App Blocks by Wojtek Kozaczynski

**UPDATE** – The streaming site has been taken down, so none of the
links work anymore. Sorry about that. We will be updating the
[Architecture Strategy
Series](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series) at some
point in the future with at least the Realizing SOA and Data in SOA
talks.
