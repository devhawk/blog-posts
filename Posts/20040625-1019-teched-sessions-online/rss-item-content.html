<p>Streaming producer presenations from TechEd US have been posted. However, the streaming presenation site has the same <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7933dc2b-d9ae-46d0-8827-f67e7a884b39">lack-of-url-addressability</a> issue that TechEd Breakout session list had. Is it so hard to just post a simple HTML file with a list of all the sessions in a track? &lt;sigh&gt;</p><p>Anyway, here are links to the top 5 sessions from this year's architecture track. For those who could not make it to TechEd (or were there, but missed these sessions) enjoy!</p><ol><li>Realizing SOA by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados">John deVadoss</a> &amp; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/RJacobs/">Ron Jacobs</a></li><li>Data in SOA by Harry Pierson (i.e. yours truly)

Sorry about that.
