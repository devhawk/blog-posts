Lots of digital ink have been spilled on this topic since we announced LINQ @ PDC 05, so I&#8217;ll just point out that I think this is the first OR\/M solution that really works well across the board.  <\/li>\n<li>David Ing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.from9till2.com\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d75637fe-a7cc-4f18-b0bd-aecddafb9542\">sucks the fun out of PopFly<\/a> by suggesting it might be a &#8220;nice data aggregation \/ reformatting service for technically-challenged managers [and] their business data&#8221;.

From the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.popfly.com\/Overview\/faq.aspx\">PopFly FAQ<\/a>: &#8220;We\u2019re going back to our roots in 1975 when Microsoft originally launched BASIC for the Altair 8080. Tools like BASIC and Visual Basic 1.0 democratized development by enabling users to easily build applications on DOS and Windows. We believe we can make Popfly a great tool for building and sharing applications on the Web.&#8221;  <\/li>\n<li>Scott Hanselman <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/ScottHanselman\/~3\/118288319\/IsMicrosoftLosingTheAlphaGeeks.aspx\">wonders<\/a> if Microsoft is losing the Alpha Geeks. In a related vein, I wonder if MS should be learning more aggressively from the community. MS has been the source of many developer innovations, but certainly not all. For ideas pioneered elsewhere,\u00a0we tend to eventually get it, but I think we could be better about it. <\/li>\n<li>Apparently, I&#8217;m just a little younger than video games.
