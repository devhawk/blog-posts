But I <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/martinesmann\/status\/4074900218\">got word<\/a> from my esteemed host <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/martinesmann\">Martin Esmann<\/a> that the <a href=\"http:\/\/channel9.msdn.com\/posts\/martinesmann\/Pumping-Iron-Dynamic-Languages-on-NET\/\">video of my TechTalk<\/a> had been posted to Channel 9, so it seems as good a time as any for my trip report.<\/p>\n<p>At each of these universities, I did two talks. The first was Pumping Iron: The State of Dynamic Languages on the .NET Framework. That\u2019s the one in the Channel 9 video. The other talk was <a href=\"http:\/\/cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com\/self.aspx\/DevHawk%20Content\/Presentations\/Developing%20on%20the%20DLR.pptx\">Developing with the DLR<\/a>, which I\u2019ve posted to my Skydrive. That talk was more focused on the CLR and DLR as a platform for language development. If there\u2019s interest (leave a comment), I\u2019ll record audio for that presentation and post it up on SlideShare or something like that. <\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/en.aau.dk\/\">Aalborg University<\/a><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/WindowsLiveWriter\/DanishUniversityTourTripReport_9595\/IronPython_DK_trip_on_a_map_2.png\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1288\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"IronPython_DK_trip_on_a_map\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IronPython_DK_trip_on_a_map\" align=\"right\" src=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/WindowsLiveWriter\/DanishUniversityTourTripReport_9595\/IronPython_DK_trip_on_a_map_thumb.png\" width=\"108\" height=\"124\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>First stop of the University Tour was Aalborg University \u2013 about a four hour drive from Copenhagen (or as the Danish spell it K\u00f8benhavn). As you can see on the map, we started with the furthest university away then worked our way back to Copenhagen. Martin picked me up at the airport and we hit the road. I was horribly jet lagged, but we spent most of the drive geeking out about programming languages (when I wasn\u2019t napping).<\/p>\n<p>Each of the universities had a different focus that I was interested in. At Aalborg, it was in teaching programming. Given the popularity of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.python.org\/community\/sigs\/current\/edu-sig\/\">Python in education<\/a>, we had lots to talk about. My host at Aalborg was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cs.aau.dk\/~bt\/\">Bent Thomsen<\/a> who has done <a href=\"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/u481122hk38w4j32\/\">significant research<\/a> on this topic, as has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/2267261t17202k77\/\">his wife Lone<\/a>. One of the areas we discussing in particular was about teaching classes vs. objects first. Apparently, these days there\u2019s significant momentum behind teaching class first, but the folks at Aalborg \u2013 as I understand it \u2013 have seen that approach has been ineffective. That squared with a talk I saw on teaching OOP with Python that I saw <a href=\"http:\/\/us.pycon.org\/2008\/conference\/talks\/?search=Goldwasser\">last year at PyCon<\/a> by <a href=\"http:\/\/euler.slu.edu\/~goldwasser\/publications\/\">Dr. Goldwasser<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The other area we discussed was teaching <a href=\"https:\/\/intranet.cs.aau.dk\/education\/courses\/2009\/spo\">compiler design<\/a>. Clearly, this is an area I thought the DLR could be a big help in. Bent primarily uses <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Programming-Language-Processors-Java-Interpreters\/dp\/0130257869\">Programming Language Processors in Java<\/a> to teach this course, but he finds that it\u2019s a little out of date + he\u2019s much more interested in the compiler aspect than the interpreter aspect of that book. The idea of generating DLR Expression Trees which can be compiled into IL with a simple call to <a href=\"http:\/\/dlr.codeplex.com\/SourceControl\/changeset\/view\/27854#580545\">LambdaExpression.Compile<\/a> and can then run directly on the CLR seemed to sound appealing to him. <\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.au.dk\/en\">Aarhus University<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Next up was Aarhus University. I didn\u2019t get to spend as much time with the folks from Aarhus, though our host <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brics.dk\/~danvy\/\">Olivier Danvy<\/a> did help me find a \u201cuniquely Danish\u201d gift for my wife (though I also brought her Danish bread &amp; chocolate). We spent some time talking about F# and compiler design, and Olivier made this great comment over lunch that \u201cOCaml is a domain specific language for compiler writers\u201d. That is very true.<\/p>\n<p>Olivier had to leave for a previous engagement, so <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brics.dk\/~jmi\/\">Jan Midtgaard<\/a> &#8211; who teaches Aarhus\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.daimi.au.dk\/dOvs\/\">Compilation class<\/a> \u2013 hosted me for the actual talks. In that class, they implement a subset of Java known as Joos in AspectJ. One of the cool things about this class is how they grade the compilers \u2013 you upload your complier code to a web site and they run it against an existing test framework. They couldn\u2019t give the students the test framework directly because it would be too easy to reverse engineer the tests from the compiled Java code (I assume the Java world has the equivalent of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.red-gate.com\/products\/reflector\/\">Reflector<\/a>?) Like Aalborg, I spent significant time discussing the idea of targeting the DLR in their compiler class. <\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sdu.dk\/?sc_lang=en\">University of Southern Denmark<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Of the four universities I visited, this was probably the poorest fit for the content I was delivering. On the other hand, it was awesome \u2013 USD has a strong focus on Robotics. They even have a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.robodays.com\/activities\/robodays-robot-festival-in-odense.aspx\">RoboDays Robot Festival<\/a> in Odense. Unfortunately, the festival was the weekend after I visited, so many of the robots were out in preparation for the festival. However, our host <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mip.sdu.dk\/people\/Staff\/ups.html\">Ulrik Schultz<\/a> did bring us to to visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/modular.mmmi.sdu.dk\/wiki\/Main_Page\">Modular Robotics Research Lab<\/a> so I got to see these guys in action:<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; width: 425px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px\" id=\"scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:03a073ea-5567-4e13-ba0d-d2b78cf96155\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">\n<div id=\"d33c395b-2d4e-4e85-b752-23636cfbfe64\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;\">\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SYizuooEs7s\" target=\"_new\"><img src=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/WindowsLiveWriter\/DanishUniversityTourTripReport_9595\/videod9804c33b78e.jpg\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1288\" style=\"border-style: none\" galleryimg=\"no\" onload=\"var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('d33c395b-2d4e-4e85-b752-23636cfbfe64'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/SYizuooEs7s&amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/SYizuooEs7s&amp;hl=en&quot; type=&quot;application\/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Real transforming robots! Not quite Optimus Prime mind you, but you gotta start somewhere. These robots are call <a href=\"http:\/\/modular.mmmi.sdu.dk\/wiki\/ATRON\">ATRON<\/a> and they\u2019re pretty impressive to see in action. However, they are kinda weak computationally \u2013 they only have 128k of flash memory + 4k of ROM. 4K! However, the next generation of these bots is supposed to have like 64MB of memory and a FPGA \u2013 more than enough power to use the the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/netmf\">Micro Framework<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ku.dk\/english\/\">University of Copenhagen<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>The final stop on my university tour was University of Copenhagen, where I was hosted by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diku.dk\/hjemmesider\/ansatte\/henglein\/\">Fritz Henglein<\/a> of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diku.dk\/Forskning\/algorithmsandprogramminlanguages\/\">Algorithms and Programming Languages Group<\/a>. He\u2019s done some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diku.dk\/hjemmesider\/ansatte\/henglein\/\/publications\/\/henglein94b.html\">research on dynamic languages<\/a>, but these days he and his team are doing some fascinating research on the intersection of business and programming languages. He leads a project called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.3gerp.org\/\">3gERP<\/a> in partnership with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/danmark\/mdcc\/default.mspx\">Microsoft Development Center Copenhagen<\/a> to \u201cdevelop a standardized, yet highly configurable and flexible, global ERP system for SME\u2019s based on fundamentally new software architecture.\u201d That topic isn\u2019t as interesting to me in my current role in the VS Languages team, but was very relevant to my background in services architecture and MSIT.<\/p>\n<h3>Copenhagen .NET Users Group<\/h3>\n<p>While I was in Denmark, I got to speak to the local .NET users group about IronPython. These are always fun since they are less formal. Also, this was a much more .NET knowledgeable crowd than I had had all week so I got some deeper questions about the .NET stack. Among the members of that user group is <a href=\"http:\/\/madskristensen.net\/\">Mads Kristensen<\/a>, founder of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dotnetblogengine.net\/\">BlogEngine.NET<\/a> project. So I put together a special demo \u201cintegrating\u201d IronPython into BlogEngine.NET. It was kinda silly \u2013 I wrote an extension that would execute any blog post as python that was in the RunPython category. But it was also mind-numbingly simple:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp\">\n[Extension(\"Extend .NET Blog Engine with IronPython\")]\npublic class IPyExtension\n{\n    static ScriptEngine _engine;\n\n    static IPyExtension()\n    {\n        _engine = IronPython.Hosting.Python.CreateEngine();\n        Post.Serving += new EventHandler&lt;ServingEventArgs&gt;(Post_Serving);\n    }\n\n\n    static void Post_Serving(object sender, ServingEventArgs e)\n    {\n        Post p = (Post)sender;\n        bool runpython = p.Categories.Exists(delegate(Category cat) { \n            return string.Compare(cat.Title, \"RunPython\", true) == 0; });\n        if (runpython)\n        {\n            e.Body = _engine.Execute&lt;string&gt;(e.Body);\n        }\n    }\n}\n<\/pre>\n<p>I\u2019d love to see REAL IronPython integration into BlogEngine.NET, but I needed something I could do in a couple of hours late at night in a code base I wasn\u2019t familiar with.<\/p>\n<h3>Pumping Iron TechTalk <\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/WindowsLiveWriter\/DanishUniversityTourTripReport_9595\/IMG_2297_2.jpg\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1288\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: 0px\" title=\"IMG_2297\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_2297\" align=\"right\" src=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/WindowsLiveWriter\/DanishUniversityTourTripReport_9595\/IMG_2297_thumb.jpg\" width=\"164\" height=\"124\" \/><\/a> Finally, on Friday I delivered my final talk of the week, which is available to watch and download from <a href=\"http:\/\/channel9.msdn.com\/posts\/martinesmann\/Pumping-Iron-Dynamic-Languages-on-NET\/\">Channel 9<\/a>.

My wife always tells me that she\u2019d love it if I got a 6-12 month assignment to work overseas, so I tried to convince the NAV team that they REALLY want to integrate IronPython like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.langnetsymposium.com\/2009\/talks\/13-RomanIvantsov-IronPythonMSDynamic.html\">Dynamics AX team<\/a> is doing.
