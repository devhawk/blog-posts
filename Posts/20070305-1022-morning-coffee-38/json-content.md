-   As predicted, the XNA guys had a [bunch of news to
    announce](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/03/04/it-s-time-once-more-for-the-game-developer-conference-gdc-and-we-ve-got-a-lot-of-exciting-news-to-share.aspx)
    at GDC. They launched the [XNA Creators Club
    Online](http://creators.xna.com/) with
    [samples](http://creators.xna.com/education/samples.aspx),
    [forums](http://creators.xna.com/forums/default.aspx) and a new
    [starter kit](http://creators.xna.com/Education/StarterKits.aspx).
    Also they announced some cool
    [partnerships](http://creators.xna.com/Resources/Partners.aspx) for
    Creators Club Premium members (aka the folks who paid \$99 a year to
    be able to run code on their Xbox 360) including access to the
    highly anticipated [Torque X
    Engine](http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque/x/).
-   From Don Syme, we here that the new 1.9 version of F\# is [almost
    ready](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/03/04/f-1-9-almost-ready.aspx).
    When I
    [shifted](http://devhawk.net/2007/02/06/Morning+Coffee+25.aspx) from
    learning F\# to learning PowerShell, it wasn’t because of a sudden
    lack of interest in F\#, so I’m glad to see them still chugging
    along. And by the time they release 2.0 later this year, I hope to
    have learned enough PowerShell that I can spend some time focusing
    on learning F\#.

    Lam](http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=161254) at
    Microsoft reviewed more than [10,000
    images](http://weblogs.asp.net/lduveau/archive/2007/02/26/amazing-vista-wallpapers.aspx)
    to pick the new Vista Wallpapers. Not sure if I would love or hate
    that job. But some that didn’t make the cut are [available
    online](http://www.flickr.com/photos/darwishh/sets/72157594510047657/).

    [reviews](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/03/05/TextEditors.aspx) a
    number of lightweight, syntax-highlighting text editors. Personally,
    I like [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html), but as
    Tomas mentions there’s no way to save your settings. Also, there’s
    no way to add new syntax highlighting without recompiling it. For
    example, Wesner Moise compiled a version that added Ruby syntax. I
    really want a version that that supports PowerShell. Maybe it’s time
    to give [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/) a closer
    look

    available.
