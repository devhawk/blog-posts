When I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/02\/06\/Morning+Coffee+25.aspx\">shifted<\/a> from learning F# to learning PowerShell, it wasn&#8217;t because of a sudden lack of interest in F#, so I&#8217;m glad to see them still chugging along. And by the time they release 2.0 later this year, I hope to have learned enough PowerShell that I can spend some time focusing on learning F#.<\/li>\n<li>Apparently <a href=\"http:\/\/channel9.msdn.com\/Showpost.aspx?postid=161254\">Jenny Lam<\/a> at Microsoft reviewed more than <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/lduveau\/archive\/2007\/02\/26\/amazing-vista-wallpapers.aspx\">10,000 images<\/a> to pick the new Vista Wallpapers.

Personally, I like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flos-freeware.ch\/notepad2.html\">Notepad2<\/a>, but as Tomas mentions there&#8217;s no way to save your settings. Also, there&#8217;s no way to add new syntax highlighting without recompiling it. For example, Wesner Moise compiled a version that added Ruby syntax.
