<ul><li>As predicted, the XNA guys had a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/03/04/it-s-time-once-more-for-the-game-developer-conference-gdc-and-we-ve-got-a-lot-of-exciting-news-to-share.aspx">bunch of news to announce</a> at GDC. They launched the <a href="http://creators.xna.com/">XNA Creators Club Online</a> with <a href="http://creators.xna.com/education/samples.aspx">samples</a>, <a href="http://creators.xna.com/forums/default.aspx">forums</a> and a new <a href="http://creators.xna.com/Education/StarterKits.aspx">starter kit</a>. Also they announced some cool <a href="http://creators.xna.com/Resources/Partners.aspx">partnerships</a> for Creators Club Premium members (aka the folks who paid $99 a year to be able to run code on their Xbox 360) including access to the highly anticipated <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque/x/">Torque X Engine</a>.</li><li>From Don Syme, we here that the new 1.9 version of F# is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/03/04/f-1-9-almost-ready.aspx">almost ready</a>. When I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/06/Morning+Coffee+25.aspx">shifted</a> from learning F# to learning PowerShell, it wasn't because of a sudden lack of interest in F#, so I'm glad to see them still chugging along. And by the time they release 2.0 later this year, I hope to have learned enough PowerShell that I can spend some time focusing on learning F#.</li><li>Apparently <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=161254">Jenny Lam</a> at Microsoft reviewed more than <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/lduveau/archive/2007/02/26/amazing-vista-wallpapers.aspx">10,000 images</a> to pick the new Vista Wallpapers. Not sure if I would love or hate that job. But some that didn't make the cut are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/darwishh/sets/72157594510047657/">available online</a>.

Personally, I like <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a>, but as Tomas mentions there's no way to save your settings. Also, there's no way to add new syntax highlighting without recompiling it. For example, Wesner Moise compiled a version that added Ruby syntax. I really want a version that that supports PowerShell. Maybe it's time to give <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/">Notepad++</a> a closer look</li><li>Dale has some new <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!360.entry">SOAhlocis Anonymous shirts</a> available.</li><li>Jeff Atwood <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000801.html">discovers</a> that the French acronym for object oriented programming is POO. </li></ul>
