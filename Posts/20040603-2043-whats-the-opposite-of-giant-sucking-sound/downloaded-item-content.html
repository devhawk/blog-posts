<p>A while ago, Chris <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/default.aspx?content=archive.htm#giantSuckingSound">spouted</a> on the then-trend of all of his friends coming to work for MSFT. He himself <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/#boldBeginning">joined up</a>&nbsp;six month after writing that entry. Now, there seem to be a bunch of new consulting companies sprouting up. <a href="http://www.thinktecture.com/">ThinkTecture</a>, <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/">PluralSight</a>&nbsp;(thanks for the shirt Keith!), <a href="http://www.barracuda.net/">Barracuda.NET</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://wangdera.com/">Wangdera</a>&nbsp;just to name a few. Most of these seem to feature <a href="http://www.develop.com/">DevelopMentor</a> alumni.&nbsp;Will we see newly-minted MSFT alumni join this trend? I know one &#8211; my friend Jeff left MSFT to start his own consulting firm <a href="http://www.securejustice.com/">Secure Justice Solutions</a>, focusing on <a href="http://www.securejustice.com/">integrated justice information systems</a>. One isn&#8217;t a trend, but it&#8217;s interesting to watch as the economy slowly improves.

<p><span>Note, unlike Chris, who observed a trend only to become a part of it a few short months later, we won&#8217;t be seeing any&nbsp;&#8220;DevHawk Consulting&#8221; nonsense around here. I&#8217;m having *way* too much fun doing what I&#8217;m doing w/ Architecture Strategy. Besides, I get to <strike>torment</strike> work with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland">Pat</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>Update &#8211; in the comments, Avery pointed out that Rob Howard <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/archive/2004/06/02/146806.aspx">has left MSFT</a> to create a company called&nbsp;<strong>&#187;<em>telligent</em></strong>systems.</span></p>
