A while ago, Chris
[spouted](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/default.aspx?content=archive.htm#giantSuckingSound)
on the then-trend of all of his friends coming to work for MSFT. He
himself [joined
up](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/#boldBeginning) six month after
writing that entry. Now, there seem to be a bunch of new consulting
companies sprouting up. [ThinkTecture](http://www.thinktecture.com/),
[PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) (thanks for the shirt
Keith!), [Barracuda.NET](http://www.barracuda.net/) and
[Wangdera](http://wangdera.com/) just to name a few. Most of these seem
to feature [DevelopMentor](http://www.develop.com/) alumni. Will we see
newly-minted MSFT alumni join this trend? I know one – my friend Jeff
left MSFT to start his own consulting firm [Secure Justice
Solutions](http://www.securejustice.com/), focusing on [integrated
justice information systems](http://www.securejustice.com/). One isn’t a
trend, but it’s interesting to watch as the economy slowly improves.

Note, unlike Chris, who observed a trend only to become a part of
it a few short months later, we won’t be seeing any “DevHawk Consulting”
nonsense around here. I’m having \*way\* too much fun doing what I’m
doing w/ Architecture Strategy. Besides, I get to ~~torment~~ work with
[Pat](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland). 

Update – in the comments, Avery pointed out that Rob Howard [has
left
MSFT](http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/archive/2004/06/02/146806.aspx) to
create a company called **»*telligent***systems.
