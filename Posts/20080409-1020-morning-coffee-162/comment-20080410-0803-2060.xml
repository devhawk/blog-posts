  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Why are you saying the DLR spec is pretty out of date?  While I'm about ready to post an update at http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.doc, a quick scan of your copy doesn't look very out of date to me.

You may have a build of the code that is not in sync with the latest design.  Also, I note that Michael's post that you refer to directly calls on the PythonEngine class, which is not part of the common hosting model for the DLR.  One thing we're adding soon is a config/options model for passing those to engines, which would remove the need for Michael to set options on the PythonEngine directly.
