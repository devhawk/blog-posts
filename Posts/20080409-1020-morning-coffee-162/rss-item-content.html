<ul><li>Another nice thing about the new job: I'm working in the vicinity of some good friends. I was over in building 42 yesterday and made it a point to stop by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/">Pat Helland</a>'s office yesterday and spend an hour or so chatting about the new gig. Pat is down the hall from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dphill/">David Hill</a>, whom I worked with on Architecture Strategy. Back in my building, we're down the hall from the <a href="http://msdn.com/vsx">VSX folks</a> including my friends <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/klevy">Ken Levy</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/">Gareth Jones</a>. I'm sure there are more folks I know around, but hey it's only my second week! </li><li>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.carbonite.com">Carbonite</a>, which I use to back up all the digital media on my home computer. With two little kids, we have lots of digital photos as you might imagine . However, one thing that bugs me about Carbonite is that it <a href="http://www.carbonite.com/customersupport/ViewPost.aspx?postid=89">doesn't back up video files by default</a>, you have to go in on a folder by folder basis and select "'Back up Video files in this folder" from the context menu. Given how much trouble this "feature" has given me, I imagine less techie folks don't even realize their video files aren't getting backed up. However, I will say the <a href="http://www.carbonite.com/customersupport/BrowseCategory.aspx?forumid=38#0">latest version</a> of the Carbonite Software at least makes it easy to find files that aren't backed up. A quick sweep revealed around a dozen folders that had un-backed-up video files in them, which I promptly fixed.</li><li>The big news yesterday was the new <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>, which looks to give you access to virtualized infrastructure that sounds similar to what GOOG is rumored to use internally. I like Dave Winer's <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/04/08/earlyNotesOnGoogleapps.html">comment</a> that this enables "shrinkwrap net apps that scale that can be deployed by civillians." Given Google's history w/ Python - Python's <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/BDFL">BDFL</a><a href="http://www.python.org/~guido/">Guido van Rossum</a> works there - it's no surprise that Google App Engine (GAE?) <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html#language">runs on Python</a>, though <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine.html">apparently they</a> "look forward to supporting more languages in the future". I'm guessing "more languages" == Ruby, maybe Erlang too. </li><li>I wonder if/how Google App Engine will affect <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> momentum? If there's a significant lag before App Engine supports Ruby, will that drive developers to Python web stacks like <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>? (Django is <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/django.html">included in "the box"</a> with App Engine)?@ PyCon, I was surprised at the intra-language animosity I observed. I wonder how many Python developers are secretly hoping Google <em>never</em> ships Ruby support. I highly doubt Google would do that - they want to tap the exploding RoR market like everyone else - but I'd bet it would really take the wind out of Rails' sails if they did. </li><li>Today's Michael Foord Link: <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/dlr_hosting.shtml">Embedding IronPython 2, Examples of the DLR Hosting API</a>. You can read the <a href="http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.pdf">DLR Hosting spec</a>, but it's pretty out of date so Michael's article helps fill in some of the gaps. </li><li>Looks like PowerShell has gotten the open source community treatment in a project called <a href="http://pash.sourceforge.net/">Pash</a>. While I'm sure others are excited about PS on Linux or Mac, I'm excited to see PS running on Compact Framework. I wonder if it would work with XNA? </li><li>Speaking of XNA, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/XnaConsole">XNA Console</a> is a new CodePlex project that provides an IPy console to manipulate your XNA based game on the fly. Python is no stranger to game development - Civ IV for example provided mod capabilities <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civ_iv#Python">via python</a>. Alas, the compact framework can't run IPy today, so neither can XNA on Xbox. But wouldn't it be cool to hack your game in IPy running on a 360 using the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/x/xbox360messengerkit/">messenger kit</a>? (via <a href="http://ironpython-urls.blogspot.com/2008/04/xna-console.html">IPy URLs</a>) </li><li>Bart De Smet gets functional, writing <a href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2008/03/30/a-functional-c-type-switch.aspx">type switch</a> and <a href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2008/04/06/pattern-matching-in-c-part-0.aspx">pattern matching</a> in C# 3.0. I guess it works, but it sure is ugly. Why not just use F# and be done with it? </li><li>Soma <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/04/07/visual-c-2008-feature-pack-shipped.aspx">announces</a> that the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D466226B-8DAB-445F-A7B4-448B326C48E7&amp;displaylang=en">VC++ Feature Pack</a> has shipped. Somewhere, I assume, there is much (some?) rejoicing. </li></ul>
