-   Another nice thing about the new job: I’m working in the vicinity of
    some good friends. I was over in building 42 yesterday and made it a
    point to stop by [Pat Helland](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/)'s
    office yesterday and spend an hour or so chatting about the new gig.
    Pat is down the hall from [David
    Hill](http://blogs.msdn.com/dphill/), whom I worked with on
    Architecture Strategy. Back in my building, we’re down the hall from
    the [VSX folks](http://msdn.com/vsx) including my friends [Ken
    Levy](http://blogs.msdn.com/klevy) and [Gareth
    Jones](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/). I’m sure there are more
    folks I know around, but hey it’s only my second week!
-   I’m a big fan of [Carbonite](http://www.carbonite.com), which I use
    to back up all the digital media on my home computer. With two
    little kids, we have lots of digital photos as you might imagine .
    However, one thing that bugs me about Carbonite is that it [doesn’t
    back up video files by
    default](http://www.carbonite.com/customersupport/ViewPost.aspx?postid=89),
    you have to go in on a folder by folder basis and select “‘Back up
    Video files in this folder” from the context menu. Given how much
    trouble this “feature” has given me, I imagine less techie folks
    don’t even realize their video files aren’t getting backed up.
    However, I will say the [latest
    version](http://www.carbonite.com/customersupport/BrowseCategory.aspx?forumid=38#0)
    of the Carbonite Software at least makes it easy to find files that
    aren’t backed up. A quick sweep revealed around a dozen folders that
    had un-backed-up video files in them, which I promptly fixed.
-   The big news yesterday was the new [Google App
    Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/), which looks to give you
    access to virtualized infrastructure that sounds similar to what
    GOOG is rumored to use internally. I like Dave Winer’s
    [comment](http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/04/08/earlyNotesOnGoogleapps.html)
    that this enables “shrinkwrap net apps that scale that can be
    deployed by civillians.” Given Google’s history w/ Python – Python’s
    [BDFL](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BDFL) [Guido van
    Rossum](http://www.python.org/~guido/) works there – it’s no
    surprise that Google App Engine (GAE?) [runs on
    Python](http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html#language),
    though [apparently
    they](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine.html)
    “look forward to supporting more languages in the future”. I’m
    guessing “more languages” == Ruby, maybe Erlang too.
-   I wonder if/how Google App Engine will affect [Ruby on
    Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) momentum? If there’s a
    significant lag before App Engine supports Ruby, will that drive
    developers to Python web stacks like
    [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)? (Django is [included in
    “the box”](http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/django.html)
    with App Engine)?@ PyCon, I was surprised at the intra-language
    animosity I observed. I wonder how many Python developers are
    secretly hoping Google *never* ships Ruby support. I highly doubt
    Google would do that – they want to tap the exploding RoR market
    like everyone else – but I’d bet it would really take the wind out
    of Rails’ sails if they did.
-   Today’s Michael Foord Link: [Embedding IronPython 2, Examples of the
    DLR Hosting
    API](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/dlr_hosting.shtml). You
    can read the [DLR Hosting
    spec](http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.pdf),
    but it’s pretty out of date so Michael’s article helps fill in some
    of the gaps.
-   Looks like PowerShell has gotten the open source community treatment
    in a project called [Pash](http://pash.sourceforge.net/). While I’m
    sure others are excited about PS on Linux or Mac, I’m excited to see
    PS running on Compact Framework. I wonder if it would work with XNA?
-   Speaking of XNA, [XNA Console](http://www.codeplex.com/XnaConsole)
    is a new CodePlex project that provides an IPy console to manipulate
    your XNA based game on the fly. Python is no stranger to game
    development – Civ IV for example provided mod capabilities [via
    python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civ_iv#Python). Alas, the
    compact framework can’t run IPy today, so neither can XNA on Xbox.
    But wouldn’t it be cool to hack your game in IPy running on a 360
    using the [messenger
    kit](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/x/xbox360messengerkit/)?
    (via [IPy
    URLs](http://ironpython-urls.blogspot.com/2008/04/xna-console.html))
-   Bart De Smet gets functional, writing [type
    switch](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2008/03/30/a-functional-c-type-switch.aspx)
    and [pattern
    matching](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2008/04/06/pattern-matching-in-c-part-0.aspx)
    in C\# 3.0. I guess it works, but it sure is ugly. Why not just use
    F\# and be done with it?
-   Soma
    [announces](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/04/07/visual-c-2008-feature-pack-shipped.aspx)
    that the [VC++ Feature
    Pack](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D466226B-8DAB-445F-A7B4-448B326C48E7&displaylang=en)
    has shipped. Somewhere, I assume, there is much (some?) rejoicing.
