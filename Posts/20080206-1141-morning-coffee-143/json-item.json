Favorite headline: 18 and uh-oh!  <\/li>\n<li>Sounds like there&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com\/strike-status-report-everything-i-know-about-where-things-stand\/\">cause for optimism<\/a> regarding the writer&#8217;s strike. But is it already too late? Will the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/23018362\/\">9% drop in viewers<\/a> ever come back? Personally, I think the studios have hastened their own irrelevance.  <\/li>\n<li>With <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhl.com\/nhl\/app?service=page&amp;page=Recap&amp;gameNumber=805&amp;season=20072008&amp;gameType=2\">last night&#8217;s win<\/a>, the Caps are one game above .500. In and of itself, that&#8217;s nothing to be proud of &#8211; Coach Boudreau remarked when we reached .500 that the Caps had &#8220;officially reached mediocrity&#8221;. However, the Caps are the <em>only<\/em> team in the SE conference that&#8217;s above .500. If hockey used baseball standings, Carolina, Atlanta and Florida would each be 1\/2 game back of the Caps. It&#8217;s going to be a fight to the finish.  <\/li>\n<li>In fairly big managed Ruby news, <a href=\"http:\/\/sky.fit.qut.edu.au\/~kellyw\/\">Wayne Kelly<\/a> has <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/RubyDOTNET\/msg\/f34570019c391974\">decided<\/a> to contribute to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ironruby.net\/\">IronRuby<\/a> effort, effectively walking away from the <a href=\"http:\/\/rubydotnet.googlegroups.com\/web\/Home.htm\">Ruby.NET<\/a> which helped get off the ground. One the one hand, obviously this is great for IronRuby. On the other hand, I liked the idea of multiple managed implementations of Ruby, so here&#8217;s hoping Ruby.NET doesn&#8217;t fade away.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of the DLR, I know I mentioned <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mmaly\/default.aspx\">Martin Maly&#8217;s blog<\/a> in my <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/Devhawk\/~3\/226700178\/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx\">Lang.NET Morning Coffee Post<\/a>, but I didn&#8217;t actually get to read his posts on targeting the DLR until I unexpectedly had several days off sick. If you are at all interested in writing your own language for the .NET platform: <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mmaly\/default.aspx\">Go. Read. Now.<\/a> You should also check out Tomas Restrepo&#8217;s blog, he has also started <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winterdom.com\/weblog\/2008\/02\/04\/BuildingOnTheDLR.aspx\">writing about targeting the DLR<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Larry O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s blog is currently offline, but he <a href=\"http:\/\/www.knowing.net\/PermaLink,guid,c6364ebf-4345-4475-8882-31646e49b519.aspx\">commented<\/a> that he doubted my <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mmaly\/archive\/2008\/01\/08\/building-a-dlr-language-toyscript.aspx\">ToyScript<\/a> F# parser would be more than 600 lines of code. Currently, the parser is clocking in at 287 lines of code plus about 50 more for the AST. It&#8217;s not done yet &#8211; see earlier statement about being sick &#8211; but I&#8217;m fixing bugs not writing additional code at this point. To be completely accurate, that&#8217;s 287 lines of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quanttec.com\/fparsec\/\">FParsec code<\/a>. It&#8217;s taken me a little bit to learn FParsec, but so far I&#8217;m pretty happy with it.  <\/li>\n<li>Scott Hanselman <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/ScottHanselman\/~3\/227718172\/MSDeployNewIISWebDeploymentTool.aspx\">points to<\/a> the new <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.iis.net\/msdeploy\/archive\/2008\/01\/22\/welcome-to-the-web-deployment-team-blog.aspx\">MS Deploy<\/a> project, a tool for managing content and configuration on web servers. I&#8217;ve never understood why this wasn&#8217;t a standard part of IIS. It seems every hosting company I&#8217;ve used has rolled their own web-based management tool like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dotnetpanel.com\/\">DotNetPanel<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Oh yeah, Vista SP1 and Windows Server 2008 <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.technet.com\/windowsserver\/archive\/2008\/02\/04\/windows-server-2008-rtm.aspx\">shipped Monday<\/a>. Congrats!  <\/li>\n<li>I fired up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/community\/insidexbox\/\">Inside Xbox<\/a> the other day, and there was a page about the new Disney Channel show &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/tv.disney.go.com\/disneychannel\/phineasandferb\/\">Phineas and Ferb<\/a>&#8220;. Of course, with two kids under five, anything new on the Disney Channel is notable in my house. What made this blog-worthy is the fact that it&#8217;s directed and written by <a href=\"http:\/\/imdb.com\/name\/nm0693933\/\">Dan Povenmire<\/a>, who I knew from my USC days. I used to go see his band Keep Left and groan loudly at the bad puns in their song &#8220;PSA&#8221;. Dan, if you found this searching for yourself online: Awesome work, my kids love the show!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;ve been sick for three days, hence the lack of posting around here.
