One of the biggest changes is the removal of DLR&#8217;s pre-canned knowledge of IPy and IRuby. Now, you use app.config to specify DLR languages and map them to extensions. Sesh has <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/seshadripv\/archive\/2008\/09\/07\/dlr-hosting-api-latest-version-of-the-spec-is-available-online-includes-changes-to-runtime-initialization.aspx\">the details<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/seshadripv\/archive\/2008\/09\/11\/dlr-hosting-sample-simple-dlr-host-using-the-new-app-config-based-scriptruntime-creation.aspx\">a sample<\/a>. If you only care about hosting IPy, you can use our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/IronPython\/SourceControl\/FileView.aspx?itemId=490056&amp;changeSetId=39648\">language specific hosting API<\/a> which doesn&#8217;t require app.config. <\/li>\n<li>Jimmy <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.jimmy.schementi.com\/2008\/08\/silverlight-dynamic-languages-sdk-03.html\">pushed out<\/a> a new version of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/sdlsdk\/Release\/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=16845\">Silverlight Dynamic Languages SDK<\/a>. He&#8217;s on the lookout for a better name, one of his commenters suggested &#8220;SilverWhisper Kit&#8221;. <\/li>\n<li>Srivatsn shows <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/srivatsn\/archive\/2008\/09\/09\/passing-keyword-args-to-c-methods-from-ironpython.aspx\">how to pass Python keyword arguments to a C# method<\/a> using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/IronPython\/SourceControl\/FileView.aspx?itemId=478028&amp;changeSetId=39648\">ParamDictionaryAttribute<\/a>, similar to how C# supports the params keyword via the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.paramarrayattribute.aspx\">ParamArrayAttribute<\/a>. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no syntactic sugar for calling param dictionary methods from C#. I wonder, do most people like or dislike the idea of language level support for keyword arguments in C#? I&#8217;m guessing most would be against, though I think it&#8217;s a cool idea.<\/li>\n<li>Maybe it&#8217;s me, but I&#8217;ve noticed an uptick in <a href=\"http:\/\/summize.com\/search?q=ironpython\">twitter posts containing &#8220;ironpython&#8221;<\/a> of late. For example, <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jjude\/statuses\/912592287\">via Summize<\/a> I discovered <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jjude.com\/\">Joseph Jude&#8217;s blog finally{}<\/a> where he has posted a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jjude.com\/index.php\/archives\/2008\/09\/01\/a-time-tracking-tool\/\">time tracking tool<\/a> he built in IPy as well as his initial <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jjude.com\/index.php\/archives\/2008\/09\/07\/ironpython-learnings\/\">IPy learnings<\/a>. <\/li>\n<li>Michael Foord, as usual, has been generating quite a bit of good IPy content. He did a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pyconuk.org\/community\/IronPythonTutorial\">tutorial on IPy at PyCon UK<\/a>,\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ironpythoninaction.com\/\">his book<\/a> is almost done, he has some interesting thoughts on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.voidspace.org.uk\/python\/weblog\/arch_d7_2008_09_06.shtml#e1010\">dynamic language performance<\/a> and even admits that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.voidspace.org.uk\/python\/weblog\/arch_d7_2008_08_30.shtml#e1008\">he likes C#<\/a>, though not as much as he likes Python. <\/li>\n<li>Vernon Cole <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.ironpython.com\/pipermail\/users-ironpython.com\/2008-August\/008261.html\">announced<\/a> that the <a href=\"http:\/\/adodbapi.sourceforge.net\/\">adodbapi project<\/a> now supports IronPython 2.0 as well as CPython. This library is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.python.org\/topics\/database\/DatabaseAPI-2.0.html\">DB-API 2.0<\/a> compliant interface for any database that support ADO (note, that&#8217;s native ADO not ADO.NET). I love to see Python projects with explicit support for IPy. <\/li>\n<li>My boss &#8211; who apparently will be called &#8220;Rem&#8221; from now on in the office &#8211; saves you &#8220;gazillions&#8221; by <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.remlog.net\/?p=15\">explaining non-positional negotiating strategy<\/a> and draws the comparison to agile software development. Not exactly related to dynamic languages, but I&#8217;d like to see him further explore the relationship super-optimal, non-positional, significantly-hyphenated negotiation and software design. (OK, I made up &#8220;significantly-hyphenated&#8221;)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Other Stuff<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don Syme blogs about an <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dsyme\/archive\/2008\/09\/06\/f-ctp-release-update.aspx\">update to the F# CTP<\/a>, a mere week after the original release. One week? That&#8217;s more often than even IPy releases. I can&#8217;t wait to see what they ship in next week&#8217;s release! <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1173\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/>  Seriously, I hope they can keep the release sprints short, but every week would be a bit crazy!<\/li>\n<li>Speaking of F#, Matt Podwysocki <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/podwysocki\/archive\/2008\/09\/04\/fstest-updated-with-f-ctp.aspx\">updates FsTest<\/a> for the F# CTP and posts about <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/podwysocki\/archive\/2008\/09\/09\/object-oriented-f-extension-everything.aspx\">Extension Everything<\/a> in F#. Unlike C#, which only supports extension methods, F# also supports extensions properties, static methods and events, though like Matt I can&#8217;t think of a good use for extension events. <\/li>\n<li>Still speaking about F#, Andrew Kennedy has a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/andrewkennedy\/archive\/2008\/08\/29\/units-of-measure-in-f-part-one-introducing-units.aspx\">three<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/andrewkennedy\/archive\/2008\/09\/02\/units-of-measure-in-f-part-two-unit-conversions.aspx\">part<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/andrewkennedy\/archive\/2008\/09\/04\/units-of-measure-in-f-part-three-generic-units.aspx\">series<\/a> on the new units of measure feature of F#. If you were going to use F# to build the physics engine of a game, I would suspect UoM would be extremely useful. (via <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dsyme\/archive\/2008\/08\/30\/an-introduction-to-units-of-measure-by-andrew-kennedy.aspx\">Don Syme<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Oh look, Chris Smith built an <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/ChrisSmithsCompletelyUniqueView\/~3\/383195149\/simple-f-game-using-wpf.aspx\">F# version of artillery game<\/a> that uses Units of Measure for the physics code. I&#8217;ll bet UoM was extremely useful. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1173\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/li>\n<li>Talking about Live Mesh at TechEd Australia &#8211; where much to my surprise frankly they were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.liveside.net\/main\/archive\/2008\/09\/07\/live-mesh-buildup-begins-mesh-apps-shown-at-tech-ed-australia.aspx\">demoing Live Mesh Apps<\/a> &#8211; I pointed out to Scott Hanselman that Mesh is running an embedded CoreCLR (aka the same CLR from Silverlight 2). Scott went poking around and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/WindowsLiveMeshSilverlightAndTheCoreCLR.aspx\">posted what he discovered<\/a>. Looking forward to finding out what he digs up on using CoreCLR outside the browser. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Scott, I need to set up a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/SkypingTheWifeFoolproofVideoConferencingWithYourFamilyWhileOnTheRoad.aspx\">family video conference solution<\/a> like Scott&#8217;s before my next trip.<\/li>\n<li>Congrats to Glenn Block and the MEF team for their <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/gblock\/archive\/2008\/09\/06\/mef-making-its-debut-on-codeplex.aspx\">initial CodePlex source drop<\/a>! I&#8217;ve been hearing about this possibility since Glenn joined the team, so I&#8217;m really excited to see it happen. I need to take a look at it in detail (in my copious spare time) because I want to find out how to make it work with IPy.<\/li>\n<li>Bart de Smet has a whole series (<a href=\"http:\/\/community.bartdesmet.net\/blogs\/bart\/archive\/2008\/08\/26\/to-bind-or-not-to-bind-dynamic-expression-trees-part-0.aspx\">starting here<\/a>) on Dynamic Expression Trees. However, given that he specifically writes &#8220;This blog series is not about DLR itself&#8221; makes it seem pretty conceptual to me. Why not talk about DLR expression trees instead Bart?<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m sure you noticed <a href=\"http:\/\/haacked.com\/archive\/2008\/08\/29\/asp.net-mvc-codeplex-preview-5-released.aspx\">ASP.NET MVC preview 5<\/a> dropped last week. I really liked Brad Wilson&#8217;s discussion of the <a href=\"http:\/\/bradwilson.typepad.com\/blog\/2008\/08\/partial-renderi.html\">new view engine design<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Tomas Restrepo has started <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winterdom.com\/weblog\/2008\/08\/31\/WhyGitHub.aspx\">publishing his source code on GitHub<\/a>. Personally, I haven&#8217;t published any source code lately but I am using Git for all of my non IPy core work (which is stored in TFS). Like Tomas, I&#8217;m still getting the hang of Git but I&#8217;m really digging it&#8217;s speed, it&#8217;s branching and the fact that there&#8217;s zero infrastructure requirements. SVN provides the lightweight <a href=\"http:\/\/svnbook.red-bean.com\/en\/1.4\/svn.serverconfig.svnserve.html\">svnserve<\/a>, but Git is even lighter weight than that. <\/li>\n<li>I liked Steve Yegge&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/steve-yegge.blogspot.com\/2008\/09\/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html\">post on typing<\/a>. I am a touch typer, but I doubt I type 70 words a minutes. I do know where the number keys are without looking though, so I guess that&#8217;s pretty good. I remember seeing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplegeek.com\/\">Chris Anderson<\/a> demo <strike>Avalon<\/strike> WPF long before it was public and being impressed at how fast he could type. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>You know, this gets pretty long when I go a week between morning coffee posts.
