<p>You know, this gets pretty long when I go a week between morning coffee posts.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Language Stuff</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s a new version of the <a href="http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.pdf">DLR Hosting spec</a>. One of the biggest changes is the removal of DLR&#8217;s pre-canned knowledge of IPy and IRuby. Now, you use app.config to specify DLR languages and map them to extensions. Sesh has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/09/07/dlr-hosting-api-latest-version-of-the-spec-is-available-online-includes-changes-to-runtime-initialization.aspx">the details</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/09/11/dlr-hosting-sample-simple-dlr-host-using-the-new-app-config-based-scriptruntime-creation.aspx">a sample</a>. If you only care about hosting IPy, you can use our <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=490056&changeSetId=39648">language specific hosting API</a> which doesn&#8217;t require app.config. </li>
<li>Jimmy <a href="http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/2008/08/silverlight-dynamic-languages-sdk-03.html">pushed out</a> a new version of the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sdlsdk/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=16845">Silverlight Dynamic Languages SDK</a>. He&#8217;s on the lookout for a better name, one of his commenters suggested &#8220;SilverWhisper Kit&#8221;. </li>
<li>Srivatsn shows <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/srivatsn/archive/2008/09/09/passing-keyword-args-to-c-methods-from-ironpython.aspx">how to pass Python keyword arguments to a C# method</a> using <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=478028&changeSetId=39648">ParamDictionaryAttribute</a>, similar to how C# supports the params keyword via the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.paramarrayattribute.aspx">ParamArrayAttribute</a>. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no syntactic sugar for calling param dictionary methods from C#. I wonder, do most people like or dislike the idea of language level support for keyword arguments in C#? I&#8217;m guessing most would be against, though I think it&#8217;s a cool idea.</li>
<li>Maybe it&#8217;s me, but I&#8217;ve noticed an uptick in <a href="http://summize.com/search?q=ironpython">twitter posts containing &#8220;ironpython&#8221;</a> of late. For example, <a href="http://twitter.com/jjude/statuses/912592287">via Summize</a> I discovered <a href="http://www.jjude.com/">Joseph Jude&#8217;s blog finally{}</a> where he has posted a <a href="http://www.jjude.com/index.php/archives/2008/09/01/a-time-tracking-tool/">time tracking tool</a> he built in IPy as well as his initial <a href="http://www.jjude.com/index.php/archives/2008/09/07/ironpython-learnings/">IPy learnings</a>. </li>
<li>Michael Foord, as usual, has been generating quite a bit of good IPy content. He did a <a href="http://www.pyconuk.org/community/IronPythonTutorial">tutorial on IPy at PyCon UK</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ironpythoninaction.com/">his book</a> is almost done, he has some interesting thoughts on <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2008_09_06.shtml#e1010">dynamic language performance</a> and even admits that <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2008_08_30.shtml#e1008">he likes C#</a>, though not as much as he likes Python. </li>
<li>Vernon Cole <a href="http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2008-August/008261.html">announced</a> that the <a href="http://adodbapi.sourceforge.net/">adodbapi project</a> now supports IronPython 2.0 as well as CPython. This library is a <a href="http://www.python.org/topics/database/DatabaseAPI-2.0.html">DB-API 2.0</a> compliant interface for any database that support ADO (note, that&#8217;s native ADO not ADO.NET). I love to see Python projects with explicit support for IPy. </li>
<li>My boss &#8211; who apparently will be called &#8220;Rem&#8221; from now on in the office &#8211; saves you &#8220;gazillions&#8221; by <a href="http://blog.remlog.net/?p=15">explaining non-positional negotiating strategy</a> and draws the comparison to agile software development. Not exactly related to dynamic languages, but I&#8217;d like to see him further explore the relationship super-optimal, non-positional, significantly-hyphenated negotiation and software design. (OK, I made up &#8220;significantly-hyphenated&#8221;)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Stuff</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don Syme blogs about an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/09/06/f-ctp-release-update.aspx">update to the F# CTP</a>, a mere week after the original release. One week? That&#8217;s more often than even IPy releases. I can&#8217;t wait to see what they ship in next week&#8217;s release! <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group1173" alt=":)">  Seriously, I hope they can keep the release sprints short, but every week would be a bit crazy!</li>
<li>Speaking of F#, Matt Podwysocki <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/09/04/fstest-updated-with-f-ctp.aspx">updates FsTest</a> for the F# CTP and posts about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/09/09/object-oriented-f-extension-everything.aspx">Extension Everything</a> in F#. Unlike C#, which only supports extension methods, F# also supports extensions properties, static methods and events, though like Matt I can&#8217;t think of a good use for extension events. </li>
<li>Still speaking about F#, Andrew Kennedy has a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/andrewkennedy/archive/2008/08/29/units-of-measure-in-f-part-one-introducing-units.aspx">three</a><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/andrewkennedy/archive/2008/09/02/units-of-measure-in-f-part-two-unit-conversions.aspx">part</a><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/andrewkennedy/archive/2008/09/04/units-of-measure-in-f-part-three-generic-units.aspx">series</a> on the new units of measure feature of F#. If you were going to use F# to build the physics engine of a game, I would suspect UoM would be extremely useful. (via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/08/30/an-introduction-to-units-of-measure-by-andrew-kennedy.aspx">Don Syme</a>)</li>
<li>Oh look, Chris Smith built an <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ChrisSmithsCompletelyUniqueView/~3/383195149/simple-f-game-using-wpf.aspx">F# version of artillery game</a> that uses Units of Measure for the physics code. I&#8217;ll bet UoM was extremely useful. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group1173" alt=":)"> </li>
<li>Talking about Live Mesh at TechEd Australia &#8211; where much to my surprise frankly they were <a href="http://www.liveside.net/main/archive/2008/09/07/live-mesh-buildup-begins-mesh-apps-shown-at-tech-ed-australia.aspx">demoing Live Mesh Apps</a> &#8211; I pointed out to Scott Hanselman that Mesh is running an embedded CoreCLR (aka the same CLR from Silverlight 2). Scott went poking around and <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WindowsLiveMeshSilverlightAndTheCoreCLR.aspx">posted what he discovered</a>. Looking forward to finding out what he digs up on using CoreCLR outside the browser. </li>
<li>Speaking of Scott, I need to set up a <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SkypingTheWifeFoolproofVideoConferencingWithYourFamilyWhileOnTheRoad.aspx">family video conference solution</a> like Scott&#8217;s before my next trip.</li>
<li>Congrats to Glenn Block and the MEF team for their <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2008/09/06/mef-making-its-debut-on-codeplex.aspx">initial CodePlex source drop</a>! I&#8217;ve been hearing about this possibility since Glenn joined the team, so I&#8217;m really excited to see it happen. I need to take a look at it in detail (in my copious spare time) because I want to find out how to make it work with IPy.</li>
<li>Bart de Smet has a whole series (<a href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2008/08/26/to-bind-or-not-to-bind-dynamic-expression-trees-part-0.aspx">starting here</a>) on Dynamic Expression Trees. However, given that he specifically writes &#8220;This blog series is not about DLR itself&#8221; makes it seem pretty conceptual to me. Why not talk about DLR expression trees instead Bart?</li>
<li>I&#8217;m sure you noticed <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/08/29/asp.net-mvc-codeplex-preview-5-released.aspx">ASP.NET MVC preview 5</a> dropped last week. I really liked Brad Wilson&#8217;s discussion of the <a href="http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2008/08/partial-renderi.html">new view engine design</a>.</li>
<li>Tomas Restrepo has started <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2008/08/31/WhyGitHub.aspx">publishing his source code on GitHub</a>. Personally, I haven&#8217;t published any source code lately but I am using Git for all of my non IPy core work (which is stored in TFS). Like Tomas, I&#8217;m still getting the hang of Git but I&#8217;m really digging it&#8217;s speed, it&#8217;s branching and the fact that there&#8217;s zero infrastructure requirements. SVN provides the lightweight <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.serverconfig.svnserve.html">svnserve</a>, but Git is even lighter weight than that. </li>
<li>I liked Steve Yegge&#8217;s <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html">post on typing</a>. I am a touch typer, but I doubt I type 70 words a minutes. I do know where the number keys are without looking though, so I guess that&#8217;s pretty good. I remember seeing <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">Chris Anderson</a> demo <strike>Avalon</strike> WPF long before it was public and being impressed at how fast he could type. </li>
</ul>
