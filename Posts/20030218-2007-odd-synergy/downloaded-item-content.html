<p>I picked up a refferer from the MSDN magazine internal site sometime in the last 24 hours, so I&#8217;m guessing the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/03/siteskinning/default.aspx"> article</a> will be posted tomorrow. I&#8217;ve been saying for months that Feb &#8217;03 was going to be big with my first child and, much less important, my first published article. Now it appears child and article will both be &#8220;publicly available&#8221; the same day. My wife Julie is going to be induced first thing tomorrow. Funny how these things work out. </p>
