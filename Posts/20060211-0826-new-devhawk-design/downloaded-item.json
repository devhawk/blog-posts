I figured that after <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/01\/28\/Happy+Belated+Birthday+To+DevHawk.aspx\">three years<\/a>\u00a0it was high time for a new site design. Not being much of a designer, I started with the <a href=\"http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/7\/8\/0\/7802dbf0-d500-41a7-b635-5bd3131229be\/Rounded%20VS%20Design%20Templates.msi\">Rounded design template<\/a> from the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/asp.net\/reference\/design\/templates\/\">ASP.NET Design Template Gallery<\/a>. It&#8217;s much cleaner and more readable than my old deisgn, as I&#8217;ve removed all my blogrolls and fixed the width for 1024&#215;768 screens.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As part of the switch, I moved\u00a0from using a\u00a0table-based layout to a CSS-based layout. I even wrote custom dasBlog macros that render my naviagation menu and date archive\u00a0as unordered lists. The default dasBlog macros for those are rendered using tables. (Note, I didn&#8217;t rewrite the category list, so I&#8217;m not completely table free). If there&#8217;s interest from the dasBlog community, I&#8217;ll post the code.<\/p>\n<p>I gotta say, I&#8217;m not sure I see what the big deal about CSS over tables is. I mean, I&#8217;m as impressed as the next guy with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csszengarden.com\/\">CSS Zen Garden<\/a>, but honestly I don&#8217;t get it. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a developer, not a designer at heart. But CSS seems like hard-coded voodoo to me. This site has a simple fixed-width two-column layout, but it took a great deal of experimentation to get the floats coded correctly to render in both IE and FireFox. In fact, there&#8217;s a small issue with the new deisgn in IE that I didn&#8217;t bother to fix. But if I had just used tables, it would have taken five minutes. <\/p>\n<p>Please let me know what you think of the new design.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>For those of you reading this via the syndication feed, I rolled out\u00a0a new site design last night.
