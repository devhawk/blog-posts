<p>For those of you reading this via the syndication feed, I rolled out&nbsp;a new site design last night. I figured that after <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/01/28/Happy+Belated+Birthday+To+DevHawk.aspx">three years</a>&nbsp;it was high time for a new site design. Not being much of a designer, I started with the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/8/0/7802dbf0-d500-41a7-b635-5bd3131229be/Rounded%20VS%20Design%20Templates.msi">Rounded design template</a> from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/reference/design/templates/">ASP.NET Design Template Gallery</a>. It&#8217;s much cleaner and more readable than my old deisgn, as I&#8217;ve removed all my blogrolls and fixed the width for 1024&#215;768 screens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the switch, I moved&nbsp;from using a&nbsp;table-based layout to a CSS-based layout. I even wrote custom dasBlog macros that render my naviagation menu and date archive&nbsp;as unordered lists. The default dasBlog macros for those are rendered using tables. (Note, I didn&#8217;t rewrite the category list, so I&#8217;m not completely table free). If there&#8217;s interest from the dasBlog community, I&#8217;ll post the code.</p>
<p>I gotta say, I&#8217;m not sure I see what the big deal about CSS over tables is. I mean, I&#8217;m as impressed as the next guy with <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>, but honestly I don&#8217;t get it. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a developer, not a designer at heart. But CSS seems like hard-coded voodoo to me. This site has a simple fixed-width two-column layout, but it took a great deal of experimentation to get the floats coded correctly to render in both IE and FireFox. In fact, there&#8217;s a small issue with the new deisgn in IE that I didn&#8217;t bother to fix. But if I had just used tables, it would have taken five minutes. </p>
<p>Please let me know what you think of the new design.</p>
