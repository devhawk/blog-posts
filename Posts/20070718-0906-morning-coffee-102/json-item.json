It&#8217;s easily the weakest of the six HP stories so far. The first two stories were about discovering this magical world, the next two about discovering Harry&#8217;s past, and the last two about confronting said past. That leaves OotP as the odd-story-out, mostly bridging from the end of the fourth story to the start of the sixth.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of movies, the new movie feature of <a href=\"http:\/\/virtualearth.spaces.live.com\/Blog\/cns!2BBC66E99FDCDB98!8910.entry\">Mobile Search v2<\/a> rocks, though I have two quick suggestions. First, it would be nice to have a time-sorted view of when a given movie is playing. So if it&#8217;s playing at 4pm at one theater and 4:30pm at another, you&#8217;d see them in a list ordered that way. Second, how about an option to buy tickets directly from the phone?  <\/li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re interested in WPF and 3D, Eric Sink has a <a href=\"http:\/\/software.ericsink.com\/wpf3d\/index.html\">series for you<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Old news, but Windows Home Server <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.technet.com\/homeserver\/archive\/2007\/07\/16\/ship-it.aspx\">RTMed<\/a> on Monday.
