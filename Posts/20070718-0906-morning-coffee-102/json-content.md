Seems like a slow week.

-   Jules and I went to see the latest [Harry Potter
    movie](http://www.harrypotterorderofthephoenix.com/) this past
    weekend. It’s easily the weakest of the six HP stories so far. The
    first two stories were about discovering this magical world, the
    next two about discovering Harry’s past, and the last two about
    confronting said past. That leaves OotP as the odd-story-out, mostly
    bridging from the end of the fourth story to the start of the sixth.
-   Speaking of movies, the new movie feature of [Mobile Search
    v2](http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!2BBC66E99FDCDB98!8910.entry)
    rocks, though I have two quick suggestions. First, it would be nice
    to have a time-sorted view of when a given movie is playing. So if
    it’s playing at 4pm at one theater and 4:30pm at another, you’d see
    them in a list ordered that way. Second, how about an option to buy
    tickets directly from the phone?
-   If you’re interested in WPF and 3D, Eric Sink has a [series for
    you](http://software.ericsink.com/wpf3d/index.html).
-   Old news, but Windows Home Server
    [RTMed](http://blogs.technet.com/homeserver/archive/2007/07/16/ship-it.aspx)
    on Monday. I’m really looking forward to this product.
-   I was looking for some information on how WCF pumps messages in the
    service host and I found [this
    post](http://blogs.msdn.com/mahjayar/archive/2006/12/22/wcf-runtime-blocks.aspx)
    from Maheshwar Jayaraman. Between that post and Reflector, I think
    I’ve got a good handle on how ChannelDispatcher works.

    MS Research Projects. [Microsoft Research
    Accelerator](http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/25e1bea3-142e-4694-bde5-f0d44f9d8709/Details.aspx)
    is a high-level data-parallel library that targets GPUs. [Graph
    Layout Execution
    Engine](http://research.microsoft.com/~levnach/GLEEWebPage.htm) (aka
    GLEE) is a library for graph layout and viewing. [VirtualEarth
    MapCruncher](http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/66596bbd-0444-4ab1-93bc-e41f010a237d/Details.aspx)
    converts existing maps (PDF and bitmaps) to work with Virtual Earth.
-   Ted Neward [weighs
    in](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/07/14/The+Korean+Conflict+And+Why+SOAP+And+REST+Were+Never+A+Quotwarquot.aspx)
    on the David Chappell’s [Korean War REST vs. WS-\*
    analogy](http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/2007/06/rest-vs-ws-war-is-over-if-you-want-it.html).
    Skim the history lesson, but make sure you read his points about
    security and reliability interop. WS-\* has addressed these areas,
    so *if* you need those capabilities, why wouldn’t you use WS-\* to
    get them rather than re-invent the wheel? As for the history lesson,
    Ted does say he thinks software development is more analogous to
    making war than building a house. He
    [expands](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/07/14/The+Strategies+Of+Software+Development.aspx)
    on that idea and recommends Robert Greene’s [The 33 Strategies of
    War](http://www.amazon.com/33-Strategies-War-Robert-Greene/dp/0670034576).
    I want to read the book and mull it over a bit, but I certainly see
    where Ted’s coming from.
