Picked up [The Matrix Reloaded
Soundtrack](http://intothematrixmusic.com/) today. Haven’t given it a
full listen, but it’s 2 CD’s and so far I like what I hear. Also
includes the [Animatrix](http://www.intothematrix.com/) trailer, [Final
Flight of
Osiris](http://www.intothematrix.com/rl_cmp/anime_frames_osiris.html)
trailer, the [Superbowl
trailer](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/trailer2_qt.html)
and a documentary on the making of [Enter the
Matrix](http://www.enterthematrixgame.com). Day job stuff tomorrow means
I wont be able to see the movie until Friday. So what will that make me,
the last Microsoft employee in Redmond to see it?
