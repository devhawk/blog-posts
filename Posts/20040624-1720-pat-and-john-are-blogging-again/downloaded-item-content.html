<p>I keep bugging <a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog">Greg</a> about better folder hierarchy support in <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">NewsGator</a>. While I have some news feeds directly under my news folder (<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox">Don Box</a>, <a href="http://devhawk.net/www.dilbert.com">Dilbert</a>, <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/">my dad</a>) I categorize most of my feeds into subfolders. One subfolder is for MSFT architects &#8211; my teammates, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_platt/">Michael</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/">Keith</a>&nbsp;&amp; <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kevinha/">Kevin</a>&nbsp;among others. That folder is where I&nbsp;typically start reading, esp. when I&#8217;m a week behind. </p>
<p>After a long absence, both <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland">Pat</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados">John</a> are blogging again. Pat&#8217;s been busy working on his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2004/06/18/159345.aspx">new talks</a> that he will be presenting at TechEd Amsterdam. We will be taping them for inclusion in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series">Architecture Strategy Series</a>. He&#8217;s got a surprise planned for the end of his Metropolis overview talk (GNLARC) that I&#8217;m in charge of getting up on the web as soon as possible after it happens&#8230;watch this space&#8230;</p>
<p>John has written two pieces &#8211; on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2004/06/22/162923.aspx">SOA</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2004/06/23/163326.aspx">smart clients</a>. John&#8217;s amped about the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/scag.asp">SCAG</a> and he blogs about his smart client thoughts. I liked his observation that building browser-based apps &#8220;is all about service provider ease of delivery&#8221; while smart clients are &#8220;all about service consumer ease of use&#8221;. Today, ease of delivery wins out over ease of use, but I wonder how long that will last. </p>
<p>However interesting John&#8217;s views on smart clients are, I typically have long conversations with him about the finer points of SOA. A conversation that starts with &#8220;Got a sec?&#8221; typically turns into an extended discussion with crowded whiteboards. What I&#8217;ve realized recently is that John and I tend to approach a topic very differently. John is very pragmatic, so he tends to disagree with my more radical opinions (such as the <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a44821ab-94c5-4970-b1c4-6c3c3c5c832a">endangered middle tier</a>) which aren&#8217;t really feasible in the short term. I, on the other hand, start from a desired state and work backwards, trying to figure out what short term investments will lead to the long-term ideas. I used to think John and I disagreed about the desirable granularity of services. What it turns out is that we agree about what we want, but he focused on the fact we can&#8217;t feasibly build fine-grained services in the short term while I glossed over that fact and thought about what we needed to make fine-grained services feasible in the long term. Neither viewpoint is right or wrong, in fact they are very complementary. John keeps me grounded in reality while I push the limits of his event horizon. Among the recent topics of debate:</p>
<ul>
<li>How fine grained should services be?</li>
<li>Should customers be thinking about building domain specific languages?</li>
<li>How will the role of the ISV&#8217;s and SI&#8217;s evolve?</li>
<li>How much of a typical enterprise should be outsourced?</li>
<li>Is a service-oriented architecture more data-centric or process-centric?</li>
<li>What would a requirements modeling language look like?</li>
<li>What is the most important criteria for evaluating software systems for the enterprise?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep it up, John.</p>
