Congrats to the Data Dudes!

Come to think of it, I'd like to go with them to Tinkering School. According to <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2007/03/tinkering_camp.html">Geekdad</a>, they're looking helping others set up their own Tinkering Schools. I wonder if <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/">Jules</a> would be down to help me run one? </li><li><a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/">Sandboxie</a> is a sandbox environment for your windows based PC. Basically, it traps writes to the filesystem and registry and stores them in a seperate file that is easily tossed away. Sort of like virtual machine differencing drives, but for your host machine. I'll have to check it out. I wonder how it <a href="http://www.softricity.com/products/virtualization.asp">compares</a> to Microsoft's recent aqusition <a href="http://www.softricity.com/">Softricity</a>?

As per the <a href="http://www.bugbash.net/about/">about page</a>, Bug Bash started "a comic strip in the company newsletter of a large northwest software company...[who's] name rhymes with 'Microsoft'." It is a hilarious Dev/IT focused comic strip from the same guy who writes <a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/">Mr. Cranky</a>. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BugBash">Subscribed</a>.
