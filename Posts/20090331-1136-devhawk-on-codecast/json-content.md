[Ken Levy](http://mashupx.com/blog/) used to work around the corner from
my office, [back in his
days](http://blogs.msdn.com/klevy/archive/2008/07/11/moving-on-to-something-new-but-staying-close.aspx)
on the [VSX team](http://blogs.msdn.com/vsxteam). These days, heâ€™s
hosting the [CodeCast](http://www.code-magazine.com/codecast/) (among
other things) and he dropped my my office a while back to [chat about
IronPython](http://www.code-magazine.com/codecast/index.aspx?messageid=84d9aac0-e390-4177-9941-1dcab6aaa441)
for his podcast.
