I&#8217;m obviously off the pace I set in January of averaging a <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/01\/31\/Morning+Coffee+21.aspx\">post a day<\/a>, but I am averaging just under nine tenth of a post per day. Not bad. At this rate, I&#8217;ll post almost as much this year as I did the last two years combined.<\/li>\n<li>It was a great family weekend. Saturday, three of my friends helped me move an upright piano that we got used for a great price. Luckily, one of said friends is also a physics teacher, otherwise I don&#8217;t think we could have gotten that heavy thing in the truck. To say thanks, we BBQed for them Saturday evening. Then yesterday we took the kids to see a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sesamestreetlive.com\/storylines.asp#1\">Sesame Street Live<\/a> show. Both days were beautiful, which my wife <a href=\"http:\/\/techiewife.spaces.live.com\/blog\/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!801.entry\">greatly appreciated<\/a>. <\/li>\n<li>The Caps hit the free agent market running yesterday, picking up <a href=\"http:\/\/japersrink.blogspot.com\/2007\/07\/caps-sign-poti.html\">Tom Poti<\/a> (four years, $14 million) and <a href=\"http:\/\/japersrink.blogspot.com\/2007\/07\/caps-sign-kozlov.html\">Victor Kozlov<\/a> (two years, $5 million). They weren&#8217;t the A-list free agents, but they both seem like solid pickups. According to Japer&#8217;s Rink, the Caps <a href=\"http:\/\/japersrink.blogspot.com\/2007\/06\/34300000-to-50300000.html\">were about $6.5 million<\/a> under the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tsn.ca\/nhl\/news_story\/?ID=212226\">new cap minimum<\/a>. These two signings just about close that gap, but it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.readexpress.com\/read_freeride\/2007\/06\/a_little_more_than_one.php\">doesn&#8217;t sound<\/a> like they&#8217;re done. That&#8217;s good news for Caps fans.<\/li>\n<li>Scott Guthrie <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2007\/06\/29\/linq-to-sql-part-3-querying-our-database.aspx\">continues his series<\/a> on LINQ to SQL. While I&#8217;ve seen most of this before, the cool thing Scott shows is hovering over the LINQ to SQL result and bringing up the exact SQL statement in a debugger window. That&#8217;s pretty cool.<\/li>\n<li>Nick Malik is now &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/nickmalik\/archive\/2007\/06\/29\/as-the-role-changes.aspx\">Mr. SOA<\/a>&#8221; inside MSIT. As you might imagine, I&#8217;ll be working with him fairly closely. Actually, he&#8217;s late to a meeting with me as I type this. <\/li>\n<li>John Shewchuk <a href=\"http:\/\/connectedsystems.spaces.live.com\/Blog\/cns!10E0A1CD60CAE1A9!263.entry\">announces a new version<\/a> of BizTalk Services coming soon. The big new feature is access control for services exposed via the BizTalk Services. If you can&#8217;t wait, you can try out the new stuff in their <a href=\"http:\/\/labs-ppe.biztalk.net\/\">pre-production environment<\/a> right now, before it&#8217;s live. Is this a beta of a beta?<\/li>\n<li>Soma announces the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/smallbusiness\">MSDN Small Business Developer Center<\/a>. I took a quick look thru the site. Strangely enough, it doesn&#8217;t cover <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/dynamics\">Dynamics<\/a> &#8211; Microsoft&#8217;s business software primarily targeting small and medium size businesses. <\/li>\n<li>Ted Neward called object\/relational mapping the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2006\/06\/26\/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx\">Vietnam of Computer Science<\/a>&#8220;. David Chappell gives us our next war \/ technology analogy, declaring that the REST vs. WS-* war is over, ending in a truce like the Korean war rather than &#8220;crushing victory for one side&#8221;. <\/li>\n<li>Like Jeff Atwood, I didn&#8217;t realize About Face has been updated, twice. I am a huge fan of the first edition, but Jeff <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codinghorror.com\/blog\/archives\/000897.html\">calls About Face 3<\/a> &#8220;the best edition of this classic yet&#8221;. I just ordered a copy for myself.<\/li>\n<li>David McGhee transcribed a fantastic session with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/exec\/techfellow\/Ferguson\/default.mspx\">Dr. Don Ferguson<\/a> at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.architectureforum.net.au\/Pages\/aaf.aspx\">Australian Architecture Forum<\/a> on SOA\/ESB integration in the real world. Go read the whole thing. Udi Dahan <a href=\"http:\/\/udidahan.weblogs.us\/2007\/06\/30\/no-such-thing-as-a-centralized-esb\/\">pulls out the quote<\/a> &#8220;there is no such thing as a centralized ESB.&#8221; Amen to that. My other favorite quotes from this discussion is &#8220;The temptation is often to get everything in a repository, but often you cannot rely on people to put everything in the registry&#8221; and &#8220;there is sometimes the \u201cHighlander\u201d philosophy of there can be only one service&#8221;. If you&#8217;re design depends on centralization and\/or significant change in human behavior, it&#8217;s doomed from the start. Frankly, it&#8217;s amazing how often that happens.<\/li>\n<li>In response to my <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/06\/26\/What+Is+The+Rails+Question.aspx\">What is the Rails Question post<\/a>, Hartmut Wilms <a href=\"http:\/\/www.innoq.com\/blog\/hw\/2007\/06\/29\/the_rails_question_the_net_open_source_dilemma.html\">wonders why<\/a> &#8220;the .NET community (for the most part) ignores Open Source Projects&#8221;. I wonder the same thing, though I don&#8217;t think you can lump the whole .NET community together on this. While some parts of the community ignore anything they can&#8217;t download from MSDN, other parts strongly embrace open source projects. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>For the first six months of 2007, I posted 158 times in 181 days.
