<li>For the first six months of 2007, I posted 158 times in 181 days. I&#8217;m obviously off the pace I set in January of averaging a <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/31/Morning+Coffee+21.aspx">post a day</a>, but I am averaging just under nine tenth of a post per day. Not bad. At this rate, I&#8217;ll post almost as much this year as I did the last two years combined.</li>
<li>It was a great family weekend. Saturday, three of my friends helped me move an upright piano that we got used for a great price. Luckily, one of said friends is also a physics teacher, otherwise I don&#8217;t think we could have gotten that heavy thing in the truck. To say thanks, we BBQed for them Saturday evening. Then yesterday we took the kids to see a <a href="http://www.sesamestreetlive.com/storylines.asp#1">Sesame Street Live</a> show. Both days were beautiful, which my wife <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!801.entry">greatly appreciated</a>. </li>
<li>The Caps hit the free agent market running yesterday, picking up <a href="http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2007/07/caps-sign-poti.html">Tom Poti</a> (four years, $14 million) and <a href="http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2007/07/caps-sign-kozlov.html">Victor Kozlov</a> (two years, $5 million). They weren&#8217;t the A-list free agents, but they both seem like solid pickups. According to Japer&#8217;s Rink, the Caps <a href="http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2007/06/34300000-to-50300000.html">were about $6.5 million</a> under the <a href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=212226">new cap minimum</a>. These two signings just about close that gap, but it <a href="http://www.readexpress.com/read_freeride/2007/06/a_little_more_than_one.php">doesn&#8217;t sound</a> like they&#8217;re done. That&#8217;s good news for Caps fans.</li>
<li>Scott Guthrie <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/06/29/linq-to-sql-part-3-querying-our-database.aspx">continues his series</a> on LINQ to SQL. While I&#8217;ve seen most of this before, the cool thing Scott shows is hovering over the LINQ to SQL result and bringing up the exact SQL statement in a debugger window. That&#8217;s pretty cool.</li>
<li>Nick Malik is now &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/29/as-the-role-changes.aspx">Mr. SOA</a>&#8221; inside MSIT. As you might imagine, I&#8217;ll be working with him fairly closely. Actually, he&#8217;s late to a meeting with me as I type this. </li>
<li>John Shewchuk <a href="http://connectedsystems.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!10E0A1CD60CAE1A9!263.entry">announces a new version</a> of BizTalk Services coming soon. The big new feature is access control for services exposed via the BizTalk Services. If you can&#8217;t wait, you can try out the new stuff in their <a href="http://labs-ppe.biztalk.net/">pre-production environment</a> right now, before it&#8217;s live. Is this a beta of a beta?</li>
<li>Soma announces the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/smallbusiness">MSDN Small Business Developer Center</a>. I took a quick look thru the site. Strangely enough, it doesn&#8217;t cover <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/dynamics">Dynamics</a> &#8211; Microsoft&#8217;s business software primarily targeting small and medium size businesses. </li>
<li>Ted Neward called object/relational mapping the &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx">Vietnam of Computer Science</a>&#8220;. David Chappell gives us our next war / technology analogy, declaring that the REST vs. WS-* war is over, ending in a truce like the Korean war rather than &#8220;crushing victory for one side&#8221;. </li>
<li>Like Jeff Atwood, I didn&#8217;t realize About Face has been updated, twice. I am a huge fan of the first edition, but Jeff <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000897.html">calls About Face 3</a> &#8220;the best edition of this classic yet&#8221;. I just ordered a copy for myself.</li>
<li>David McGhee transcribed a fantastic session with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/techfellow/Ferguson/default.mspx">Dr. Don Ferguson</a> at the <a href="http://www.architectureforum.net.au/Pages/aaf.aspx">Australian Architecture Forum</a> on SOA/ESB integration in the real world. Go read the whole thing. Udi Dahan <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/06/30/no-such-thing-as-a-centralized-esb/">pulls out the quote</a> &#8220;there is no such thing as a centralized ESB.&#8221; Amen to that. My other favorite quotes from this discussion is &#8220;The temptation is often to get everything in a repository, but often you cannot rely on people to put everything in the registry&#8221; and &#8220;there is sometimes the &#8220;Highlander&#8221; philosophy of there can be only one service&#8221;. If you&#8217;re design depends on centralization and/or significant change in human behavior, it&#8217;s doomed from the start. Frankly, it&#8217;s amazing how often that happens.</li>
<li>In response to my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/06/26/What+Is+The+Rails+Question.aspx">What is the Rails Question post</a>, Hartmut Wilms <a href="http://www.innoq.com/blog/hw/2007/06/29/the_rails_question_the_net_open_source_dilemma.html">wonders why</a> &#8220;the .NET community (for the most part) ignores Open Source Projects&#8221;. I wonder the same thing, though I don&#8217;t think you can lump the whole .NET community together on this. While some parts of the community ignore anything they can&#8217;t download from MSDN, other parts strongly embrace open source projects. </li>
