-   For the first six months of 2007, I posted 158 times in 181 days.
    I’m obviously off the pace I set in January of averaging a [post a
    day](http://devhawk.net/2007/01/31/morning-coffee-21/), but I am
    averaging just under nine tenth of a post per day. Not bad. At this
    rate, I’ll post almost as much this year as I did the last two years
    combined.
-   It was a great family weekend. Saturday, three of my friends helped
    me move an upright piano that we got used for a great price.
    Luckily, one of said friends is also a physics teacher, otherwise I
    don’t think we could have gotten that heavy thing in the truck. To
    say thanks, we BBQed for them Saturday evening. Then yesterday we
    took the kids to see a [Sesame Street
    Live](http://www.sesamestreetlive.com/storylines.asp#1) show. Both
    days were beautiful, which my wife [greatly
    appreciated](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!801.entry).
-   The Caps hit the free agent market running yesterday, picking up
    [Tom
    Poti](http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2007/07/caps-sign-poti.html)
    (four years, \$14 million) and [Victor
    Kozlov](http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2007/07/caps-sign-kozlov.html)
    (two years, \$5 million). They weren’t the A-list free agents, but
    they both seem like solid pickups. According to Japer’s Rink, the
    Caps [were about \$6.5
    million](http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2007/06/34300000-to-50300000.html)
    under the [new cap
    minimum](http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=212226). These two
    signings just about close that gap, but it [doesn’t
    sound](http://www.readexpress.com/read_freeride/2007/06/a_little_more_than_one.php)
    like they’re done. That’s good news for Caps fans.
-   Scott Guthrie [continues his
    series](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/06/29/linq-to-sql-part-3-querying-our-database.aspx)
    on LINQ to SQL. While I’ve seen most of this before, the cool thing
    Scott shows is hovering over the LINQ to SQL result and bringing up
    the exact SQL statement in a debugger window. That’s pretty cool.
-   Nick Malik is now “[Mr.
    SOA](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/29/as-the-role-changes.aspx)”
    inside MSIT. As you might imagine, I’ll be working with him fairly
    closely. Actually, he’s late to a meeting with me as I type this.
-   John Shewchuk [announces a new
    version](http://connectedsystems.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!10E0A1CD60CAE1A9!263.entry)
    of BizTalk Services coming soon. The big new feature is access
    control for services exposed via the BizTalk Services. If you can’t
    wait, you can try out the new stuff in their [pre-production
    environment](http://labs-ppe.biztalk.net/) right now, before it’s
    live. Is this a beta of a beta?
-   Soma announces the [MSDN Small Business Developer
    Center](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/smallbusiness). I took a quick
    look thru the site. Strangely enough, it doesn’t cover
    [Dynamics](http://www.microsoft.com/dynamics) – Microsoft’s business
    software primarily targeting small and medium size businesses.
-   Ted Neward called object/relational mapping the “[Vietnam of
    Computer
    Science](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx)“.
    David Chappell gives us our next war / technology analogy, declaring
    that the REST vs. WS-\* war is over, ending in a truce like the
    Korean war rather than “crushing victory for one side”.
-   Like Jeff Atwood, I didn’t realize About Face has been updated,
    twice. I am a huge fan of the first edition, but Jeff [calls About
    Face 3](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000897.html) “the
    best edition of this classic yet”. I just ordered a copy for myself.
-   David McGhee transcribed a fantastic session with [Dr. Don
    Ferguson](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/techfellow/Ferguson/default.mspx)
    at the [Australian Architecture
    Forum](http://www.architectureforum.net.au/Pages/aaf.aspx) on
    SOA/ESB integration in the real world. Go read the whole thing. Udi
    Dahan [pulls out the
    quote](http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/06/30/no-such-thing-as-a-centralized-esb/)
    “there is no such thing as a centralized ESB.” Amen to that. My
    other favorite quotes from this discussion is “The temptation is
    often to get everything in a repository, but often you cannot rely
    on people to put everything in the registry” and “there is sometimes
    the “Highlander” philosophy of there can be only one service”. If
    you’re design depends on centralization and/or significant change in
    human behavior, it’s doomed from the start. Frankly, it’s amazing
    how often that happens.
-   In response to my [What is the Rails Question
    post](http://devhawk.net/2007/06/26/what-is-the-rails-question/),
    Hartmut Wilms [wonders
    why](http://www.innoq.com/blog/hw/2007/06/29/the_rails_question_the_net_open_source_dilemma.html)
    “the .NET community (for the most part) ignores Open Source
    Projects”. I wonder the same thing, though I don’t think you can
    lump the whole .NET community together on this. While some parts of
    the community ignore anything they can’t download from MSDN, other
    parts strongly embrace open source projects.
