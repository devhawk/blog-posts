<p>My car has a new battery so I am back in the office with my nose on the grindstone. I&#8217;ve spent most of the morning talking about SOA and my MSIT project, so I only have a few items today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicholas Carr <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/04/google_vs_sales.php">illustrates the coming competiton</a> between SalesForce.com and Google. Very interesting. Of course, that doesn&#8217;t damp &#8220;their mutual disdain for the Horrible Monster of Redmond&#8221; as Carr puts it.</li>
<li>I decre that Peter Schneider officially has too much time on his hands. I mean, if he&#8217;s got time to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/pschneider/archive/2007/04/08/brainf-compiler-and-interpreter-in-powershell.aspx">implement a compiler and interpreter</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> in Powershell, what else has he got time for? On the other hand, it&#8217;s short and shows how internal DSL friendly PS can be. (via <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1117.aspx">Larkware</a>) </li>
<li>Jeff Atwood <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000828.html">wonders</a> if MTurk is a failure. I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/08/Felipe+Cabrera+On+Amazons+Mechanical+Turk.aspx">wrote a year ago</a> that MTurk is a successful feature, but would be a failure as a stand-alone service. As I wrote then, &#8220;I&#8217;m guessing it would be worth it to Amazon to run the service even if they were the only ones using it.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
