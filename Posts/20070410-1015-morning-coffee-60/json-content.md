My car has a new battery so I am back in the office with my nose on the
grindstone. I’ve spent most of the morning talking about SOA and my MSIT
project, so I only have a few items today.

-   Nicholas Carr [illustrates the coming
    competiton](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/04/google_vs_sales.php)
    between SalesForce.com and Google. Very interesting. Of course, that
    doesn’t damp “their mutual disdain for the Horrible Monster of
    Redmond” as Carr puts it.
-   I decre that Peter Schneider officially has too much time on his
    hands. I mean, if he’s got time to [implement a compiler and
    interpreter](http://weblogs.asp.net/pschneider/archive/2007/04/08/brainf-compiler-and-interpreter-in-powershell.aspx)
    for [Brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) in
    Powershell, what else has he got time for? On the other hand, it’s
    short and shows how internal DSL friendly PS can be. (via
    [Larkware](http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1117.aspx))
-   Jeff Atwood
    [wonders](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000828.html) if
    MTurk is a failure. I [wrote a year
    ago](http://devhawk.net/2006/03/08/Felipe+Cabrera+On+Amazons+Mechanical+Turk.aspx)
    that MTurk is a successful feature, but would be a failure as a
    stand-alone service. As I wrote then, “I’m guessing it would be
    worth it to Amazon to run the service even if they were the only
    ones using it.”
