And speaking of SDKs, you can view the
[docs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/rtcclnt/rtc/real_time_communications_rtc_client_start_page.asp)
for v1.2 of the RTC Client API and download the
[SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=AE0BDC75-9F2F-4217-B97F-DFA0ADF264AA&displaylang=en).
This is an upgrade to the v1.0 of the RTC Client API that ships with
WinXP. Itâ€™s been upgraded to support [Live Communication
Server](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/livecomm/default.asp)
(previously known as RTC Server). Unlike the P2P SDK, the RTC SDK is COM
based, which should be easier to wrap in managed code
