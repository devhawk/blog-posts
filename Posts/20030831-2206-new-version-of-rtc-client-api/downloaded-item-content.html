<p>And speaking of SDKs, you can view the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/rtcclnt/rtc/real_time_communications_rtc_client_start_page.asp"> docs</a> for v1.2 of the RTC Client API and download the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=AE0BDC75-9F2F-4217-B97F-DFA0ADF264AA&displaylang=en"> SDK</a>. This is an upgrade to the v1.0 of the RTC Client API that ships with WinXP. It&#8217;s been upgraded to support <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/livecomm/default.asp"> Live Communication Server</a> (previously known as RTC Server). Unlike the P2P SDK, the RTC SDK is COM based, which should be easier to wrap in managed code</p>
