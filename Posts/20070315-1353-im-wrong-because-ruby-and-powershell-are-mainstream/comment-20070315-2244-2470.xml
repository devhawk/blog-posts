  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[orchmid, Ruby not only allows you to inject methods into objects, but into classes as well. Extension Methods in C#3/VB9 act at the class level. Javascript doesn't really have classes and I don't know Python well enough to comment.

As for why to invent another language, I certainly don't think a single lanugage feature is enough to argue for or against the existence of the PowerShell language. I fraking love PowerShell, and it has nothing to do with the ability to add new methods to classes.
