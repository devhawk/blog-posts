<a href="http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy">Brad Wilson</a> and <a title="Scott Hanselman" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> took me to task for my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/13/Morning+Coffee+44.aspx">comment</a> the other day that no "mainstream" language had implemented <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/03/13/new-orcas-language-feature-extension-methods.aspx">extension methods</a>:
<blockquote>How mainstream is Ruby on Rails for you? Ruby is a full fledged dynamic language. No hacks for "extension methods" (Brad)

Ya, I kind of blanched at that statement too...method_missing is pretty mainstream... (Scott)</blockquote>
They're right, Ruby does support the addition (and redefinition I think) of methods on a class at any time. There's a sample of this in the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/classes.html">Classes and Objects</a> chapter of <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">Programming Ruby</a> (aka the pick-axe book) where they add a basic documentation facility "available to any module or class" in Ruby by adding a doc instance method to the Module class.

&nbsp;
<pre class="brush:ruby">class Module 
  @@docs = Hash.new(nil) 
  def doc(str) 
    @@docs[self.name] = str 
  end
  def Module::doc(aClass) 
    # If we’re passed a class or module, convert to string
    # (‘&lt;=’ for classes checks for same class or subtype)
    aClass = aClass.name if aClass.type &lt;= Module 
    @@docs[aClass] || “No documentation for #{aClass}”
  end
end</pre>
Given how Ruby classes are defined, I think the newly added methods have access to the private data of the class. Extension methods in C#3/VB9 only have access the public interface of the object. But that's a fairly minor difference.

&nbsp;

FYI, Powershell can do this as well, though not as succinctly as Ruby. Scott has <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AccessingEXIFPhotoDataFromJPEGsWithPowerShell.aspx">an example</a> how you can add a DatePhotoTaken property to System.IO.FileInfo using <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar">Omar Shahine's</a><a href="http://wiki.shahine.com/default.aspx/MyWiki.PhotoLibrary">PhotoLibrary</a> project.

Chalk this up to my continuing ignorance of dynamic languages. I'm working on it, albeit slowly.
