So I’m finally caught up on my blog reading. After being on vacation for
five days, I had over 500 unread entries. Read some, marked most as read
even though I hadn’t. This problem is going to only get worse as I find
more interesting blogs to read.

What I want is for my news reader to suggest to me which of my unread
entries I am most likely to be interested in. The question is, how to
rank all the unranked entries?
