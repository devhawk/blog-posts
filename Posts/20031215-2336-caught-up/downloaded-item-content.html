<p>So I&#8217;m finally caught up on my blog reading. After being on vacation for five days, I had over 500 unread entries. Read some, marked most as read even though I hadn&#8217;t. This problem is going to only get worse as I find more interesting blogs to read. </p>
<p>What I want is for my news reader to suggest to me which of my unread entries I am most likely to be interested in. The question is, how to rank all the unranked entries? </p>
