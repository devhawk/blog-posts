  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is a debate that I keep having with someone at work.  They keep telling me how DRM is evil because they're being forced to participate.

I can't help but laugh at such statements.  I keep reminding him that he's never owned any of the movies or music that he thinks he owns.
