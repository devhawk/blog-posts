<blockquote><p>&#8220;I just tried out Napster to Go with my iMate and while I still am not sure that I like the idea of music rental, but I would pay a monthly fee to Apple if I could get access to any piece of music anytime even if just for a while after using Napster for even a few days.&nbsp; The software experience needs work, but it is a lot better than I ever expected it to be.&nbsp; Napster has something here actually, but most people don&#8217;t realize it yet because Microsoft and the industry is doing a piss poor job at showing just how interesting life can be in this model.&#8221; [<a href="http://lennpryor.blogs.com/lenn/2005/02/2005_the_year_o.html">Lenn Pryor</a>]</p>

<p dir="ltr">While Lenn admits that &#8220;Napster has something here actually&#8221;, I guess I have never understood the issue some people have with &#8220;music rental&#8221;. You don&#8217;t own the music and you never did. You&#8217;ve&nbsp;always&nbsp;owned a copy of the music. You &#8220;rented&#8221; the music in perpetuity (that&#8217;s legalese for &#8220;a long ass time&#8221;) for a flat fee. You can argue that the record labels have kept more than their fair share of said flat fee, but it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that you never owned anything but a copy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Personally, I like the Napster model much better. I am paying $15 a month in perpetuity but I get access to pretty much everything that comes out. Actually, I&#8217;m not even paying yet &#8211; I&#8217;m still in my 14 day trial period. But I&#8217;ve downloaded nearly 3GB so far including a variety of stuff that I was going to buy on CD anyway when I got around to it. Life is certainly more interesting under this model.</p>
