-   Old news, but [Reflector 5.0](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet) is
    out. W00t! Not sure when [Scott
    Hansleman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) became chief Reflector
    cheerleader, but he’s [got the
    rundown](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Reflector5ReleasedWorldDominationAssured.aspx)
    on the new features.
-   Politics 2.0 Watch: [OpenCongress](http://www.opencongress.org/).
    Sort of like Wikipedia for government. If we can disseminate
    information on [bills and
    resolutions](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/all) via the Internet,
    couldn’t we collect votes on them as well?
-   I got my hardcopy of [Powershell in
    Action](http://www.manning.com/payette/) while I was on vacation.
    Highly recommended.
-   Sam Gentle is starting to dig into WF, and [he
    posts](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/02/24/Windows-Workflow-101-or-2-Months-with-WF.aspx)
    about the difficulty getting data in and out of workflows. He’s
    using the [ExternalDataService
    infrastructure](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms735924.aspx)
    which I don’t like very much. I recommend getting friendly with the
    [WorkflowQueuingService](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.workflow.runtime.workflowqueuingservice.aspx)
    which is the low-level communication infrastructure that
    ExternalDataService builds on top of. The WQS docs are severely
    lacking, but it’s fairly straight forward to figure out.
-   Speaking of WF, Tomas Restpro
    [reviews](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/02/26/ProgrammingWindowsWorkflowFoundation.aspx)[Programming
    WF](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Windows-Workflow-Foundation-Techniques/dp/1904811213).
    Sounds fairly introductory. Personally, [Essential
    WF](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Workflow-Foundation-Microsoft-Development/dp/0321399838)
    is one of the best tech books I’ve read in a long time, so I’ll be
    skipping this book.
-   My teammate Dale is [continuing his daily
    posts](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!349.entry)
    on his blog.
-   Joe McKendrick wonders if [EDA is the new
    SOA](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=821). Frankly, both
    terms are so poorly defined that it’s hard to determine exactly what
    each term means, much less how they’re related. If you’re an IT
    industry analyst, you probably can make a ton of cash [describing
    the differences between
    them](http://soa-eda.blogspot.com/2006/11/how-eda-extends-soa-and-why-it-is.html).
    Maybe it’s me, but I don’t see that much value in SOA *without* EDA.
    In fact, I’d go so far as to say service orientation without events
    isn’t much a new architecture paradigm at all. It’s just the Same
    Old Architecture with better support for interop.
