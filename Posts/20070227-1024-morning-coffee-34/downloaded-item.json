Highly recommended.<\/li>\n<li>Sam Gentle is starting to dig into WF, and <a href=\"http:\/\/codebetter.com\/blogs\/sam.gentile\/archive\/2007\/02\/24\/Windows-Workflow-101-or-2-Months-with-WF.aspx\">he posts<\/a> about the difficulty getting data in and out of workflows. He&#8217;s using the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ms735924.aspx\">ExternalDataService infrastructure<\/a> which I don&#8217;t like very much. I recommend getting friendly with the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.workflow.runtime.workflowqueuingservice.aspx\">WorkflowQueuingService<\/a> which is the low-level communication infrastructure that ExternalDataService builds on top of. The WQS docs are severely lacking, but it&#8217;s fairly straight forward to figure out.<\/li>\n<li>Speaking of WF, Tomas Restpro <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winterdom.com\/weblog\/2007\/02\/26\/ProgrammingWindowsWorkflowFoundation.aspx\">reviews<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Programming-Windows-Workflow-Foundation-Techniques\/dp\/1904811213\">Programming WF<\/a>. Sounds fairly introductory. Personally, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Essential-Workflow-Foundation-Microsoft-Development\/dp\/0321399838\">Essential WF<\/a> is one of the best tech books I&#8217;ve read in a long time, so I&#8217;ll be skipping this book.<\/li>\n<li>My teammate Dale is <a href=\"http:\/\/halfmybrain.spaces.live.com\/Blog\/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!349.entry\">continuing his daily posts<\/a> on his blog.<\/li>\n<li>Joe McKendrick wonders if <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.zdnet.com\/service-oriented\/?p=821\">EDA is the new SOA<\/a>. Frankly, both terms are so poorly defined that it&#8217;s hard to determine exactly what each term means, much less how they&#8217;re related. If you&#8217;re an IT industry analyst, you probably can make a ton of cash <a href=\"http:\/\/soa-eda.blogspot.com\/2006\/11\/how-eda-extends-soa-and-why-it-is.html\">describing the differences between them<\/a>. Maybe it&#8217;s me, but I don&#8217;t see that much value in SOA <em>without <\/em>EDA. In fact, I&#8217;d go so far as to say service orientation without events isn&#8217;t much a new architecture paradigm at all. It&#8217;s just the Same Old Architecture with better support for interop. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Old news, but Reflector 5.0 is out. W00t!
