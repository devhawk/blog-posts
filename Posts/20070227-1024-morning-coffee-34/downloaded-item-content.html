<li>Old news, but <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet">Reflector 5.0</a> is out. W00t! Not sure when <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hansleman</a> became chief Reflector cheerleader, but he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Reflector5ReleasedWorldDominationAssured.aspx">got the rundown</a> on the new features. </li>
<li>Politics 2.0 Watch: <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/">OpenCongress</a>. Sort of like Wikipedia for government. If we can disseminate information on <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/all">bills and resolutions</a>&nbsp;via the Internet, couldn&#8217;t we collect votes on them as well? </li>
<li>I got my hardcopy of <a href="http://www.manning.com/payette/">Powershell in Action</a>&nbsp;while I was on vacation. Highly recommended.</li>
<li>Sam Gentle is starting to dig into WF, and <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/02/24/Windows-Workflow-101-or-2-Months-with-WF.aspx">he posts</a> about the difficulty getting data in and out of workflows. He&#8217;s using the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms735924.aspx">ExternalDataService infrastructure</a> which I don&#8217;t like very much. I recommend getting friendly with the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.workflow.runtime.workflowqueuingservice.aspx">WorkflowQueuingService</a> which is the low-level communication infrastructure that ExternalDataService builds on top of. The WQS docs are severely lacking, but it&#8217;s fairly straight forward to figure out.</li>
<li>Speaking of WF, Tomas Restpro <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/02/26/ProgrammingWindowsWorkflowFoundation.aspx">reviews</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Windows-Workflow-Foundation-Techniques/dp/1904811213">Programming WF</a>. Sounds fairly introductory. Personally, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Workflow-Foundation-Microsoft-Development/dp/0321399838">Essential WF</a> is one of the best tech books I&#8217;ve read in a long time, so I&#8217;ll be skipping this book.</li>
<li>My teammate Dale is <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!349.entry">continuing his daily posts</a> on his blog.</li>
<li>Joe McKendrick wonders if <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=821">EDA is the new SOA</a>. Frankly, both terms are so poorly defined that it&#8217;s hard to determine exactly what each term means, much less how they&#8217;re related. If you&#8217;re an IT industry analyst, you probably can make a ton of cash <a href="http://soa-eda.blogspot.com/2006/11/how-eda-extends-soa-and-why-it-is.html">describing the differences between them</a>. Maybe it&#8217;s me, but I don&#8217;t see that much value in SOA <em>without </em>EDA. In fact, I&#8217;d go so far as to say service orientation without events isn&#8217;t much a new architecture paradigm at all. It&#8217;s just the Same Old Architecture with better support for interop. </li>
