Nothing against them, but I&#8217;ve never been moved to sign up. But we did just sign up for the free trial of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blockbuster.com\/totalaccess\">Blockbuster Total Access<\/a>. Basically, it&#8217;s a clone of NetFlix, but you can bring your movies back to your local Blockbuster store and get a free rental on the spot. Plus, you get eCoupons (I think once a month) which are good for free movie or DVD rentals in the store. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.<\/li>\n<li>As expected, I didn&#8217;t get much done yesterday.
