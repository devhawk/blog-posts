<p>Late start + early meeting = short post today</p>
<ul>
<li>Want a free SAAB? Drop a line to <a href="http://rickbarn.spaces.live.com/">my boss</a>. Note, you have to be willing to steal it.</li>
<li>Saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424345/">Clerks II</a> last night. It was the first Kevin Smith movie I haven&#8217;t seen in the theaters since the original. Better than I expected, but it&#8217;s time for Kevin to move on to new material.</li>
<li>Unlike most avid movie fans I know, I&#8217;m not a NetFlix customer. Nothing against them, but I&#8217;ve never been moved to sign up. But we did just sign up for the free trial of <a href="https://www.blockbuster.com/totalaccess">Blockbuster Total Access</a>. Basically, it&#8217;s a clone of NetFlix, but you can bring your movies back to your local Blockbuster store and get a free rental on the spot. Plus, you get eCoupons (I think once a month) which are good for free movie or DVD rentals in the store. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</li>
<li>As expected, I didn&#8217;t get much done yesterday. I don&#8217;t think anyone did around here. I did pave the dev partition on my laptop. My laptop isn&#8217;t very Vista friendly and we blew our hardware budget on new desktops (which I am definitely not complaining about) so I&#8217;m still on XP.</li>
<li>I wonder how well <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/compact/default.mspx">SQL <strike>Mobile</strike><strike>Anywhere</strike> Compact Edition</a>&nbsp;works with ASP.NET? Seems like that would be a better choice than SQL Express for small websites like personal blogs.</li>
<li>Almost finished getting Christmas put away. What with the wind storm, it seems like it went by very fast this year.</li>
