Here&#8217;s the abstract:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Windows Runtime enables developers from a variety of languages \u2013 JavaScript, C#, Visual Basic and C++ &#8211; to use the Windows APIs in a natural and familiar way. But did you know that you can build your own components that project into those same languages for use in your Metro style apps? Watch this session to learn how to build your own Windows Runtime components with C++ that can be used across languages in Metro style applications.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t had time, but I plan to blog the demo step-by-step like I did for my <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2011\/09\/15\/using-winrt-from-csharp-build-demo\/\">\/\/build demo<\/a>.
