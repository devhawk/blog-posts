I don’t get out to talk to customers like I used to in previous jobs.
\<sigh\> But a few weeks ago, I got a chance to do a session at Channel
9′s [Developing Windows 8 Metro style apps with
C++](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Windows-Camp/Developing-Windows-8-Metro-style-apps-in-Cpp)
[Windows Camp](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Windows-Camp). There were
some great talks at the event on [XAML with
C++](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Windows-Camp/Developing-Windows-8-Metro-style-apps-in-Cpp/Building-Metro-style-apps-with-XAML-and-Cpp),
[C++ for Metro Style
Games](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Windows-Camp/Developing-Windows-8-Metro-style-apps-in-Cpp/Cpp-and-DirectX-for-Metro-Style-Games) and
 using [DirectX and XAML
together](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Windows-Camp/Developing-Windows-8-Metro-style-apps-in-Cpp/Building-Apps-with-Cpp-XAML-and-DirectX).
My talk was on building [Windows Runtime
Components](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh441572(v=vs.110).aspx)in
C++. Here’s the abstract:

> The Windows Runtime enables developers from a variety of languages –
> JavaScript, C\#, Visual Basic and C++ – to use the Windows APIs in a
> natural and familiar way. But did you know that you can build your own
> components that project into those same languages for use in your
> Metro style apps? Watch this session to learn how to build your own
> Windows Runtime components with C++ that can be used across languages
> in Metro style applications.

I haven’t had time, but I plan to blog the demo step-by-step like I did
for my [//build
demo](http://devhawk.net/2011/09/15/using-winrt-from-csharp-build-demo/).
In the meantime, check out the talk:

(Note, the static image below appears cut-off, but the video should
scale to the width of my blog automatically. If not, head on over to the
[official
page](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Windows-Camp/Developing-Windows-8-Metro-style-apps-in-Cpp/Building-Windows-Runtime-Components-with-Cpp) for
the talk over on Channel 9)
