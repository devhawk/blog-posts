My [hardware
issues](PermaLink.aspx?guid=8f0c5c9e-07d1-472f-8348-ce1995200fe6) remain
unresolved. Apparently, HP has decided that my two month old laptop with
the cracked display is *not* covered under warranty. Of course, since I
have a wide variety of accessories compatible with this machine, I’m
unlikely to scrap it even though they are charging my group a
significant portion of the original cost (\> 50%) to fix it.

As you can imagine, this is the last HP machine I will ever use.
Granted, that doesn’t mean much to HP’s bottom line – I just got this
machine when I switched jobs so I’m not due for a refresh for a while. I
don’t run the lab, so I don’t have any say over the hardware they run in
there. But I am in the market for a [Media Center
PC](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter) – luckily there are
a variety of other OEMs who offer MCE (the
[Viewsonic](http://www.viewsonic.com/products/mediacntr_m2000.htm) looks
cool).

People like [Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) scour the ‘net
to find people who have “fired” Microsoft. We are doing a better
listening to them (note, I’m not suggesting we’re done listening or that
we’ve fixed all the issues – just that we’re improving). I hope HP has
someone looking for people who have fired them.
