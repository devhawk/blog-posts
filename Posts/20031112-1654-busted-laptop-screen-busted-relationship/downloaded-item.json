Granted, that doesn&#8217;t mean much to HP&#8217;s bottom line &#8211; I just got this machine when I switched jobs so I&#8217;m not due for a refresh for a while. I don&#8217;t run the lab, so I don&#8217;t have any say over the hardware they run in there. But I am in the market for a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsxp\/mediacenter\">Media Center PC<\/a> &#8211; luckily there are a variety of other OEMs who offer MCE (the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.viewsonic.com\/products\/mediacntr_m2000.htm\">Viewsonic<\/a> looks cool).<\/p>\n<p>People like <a href=\"http:\/\/radio.weblogs.com\/0001011\/\">Scoble<\/a> scour the &#8216;net to find people who have &#8220;fired&#8221; Microsoft. We are doing a better listening to them (note, I&#8217;m not suggesting we&#8217;re done listening or that we&#8217;ve fixed all the issues &#8211; just that we&#8217;re improving). I hope HP has someone looking for people who have fired them.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>My hardware issues remain unresolved.
