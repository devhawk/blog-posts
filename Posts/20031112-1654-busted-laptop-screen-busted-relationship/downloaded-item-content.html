<p>My <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=8f0c5c9e-07d1-472f-8348-ce1995200fe6">hardware issues</a> remain unresolved. Apparently, HP has decided that my two month old laptop with the cracked display is <em>not</em> covered under warranty. Of course, since I have a wide variety of accessories compatible with this machine, I&#8217;m unlikely to scrap it even though they are charging my group a significant portion of the original cost (&gt; 50%) to fix it.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this is the last HP machine I will ever use. Granted, that doesn&#8217;t mean much to HP&#8217;s bottom line &#8211; I just got this machine when I switched jobs so I&#8217;m not due for a refresh for a while. I don&#8217;t run the lab, so I don&#8217;t have any say over the hardware they run in there. But I am in the market for a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter">Media Center PC</a> &#8211; luckily there are a variety of other OEMs who offer MCE (the <a href="http://www.viewsonic.com/products/mediacntr_m2000.htm">Viewsonic</a> looks cool).</p>
<p>People like <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> scour the &#8216;net to find people who have &#8220;fired&#8221; Microsoft. We are doing a better listening to them (note, I&#8217;m not suggesting we&#8217;re done listening or that we&#8217;ve fixed all the issues &#8211; just that we&#8217;re improving). I hope HP has someone looking for people who have fired them.</p>
