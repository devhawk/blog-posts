My <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=8f0c5c9e-07d1-472f-8348-ce1995200fe6">hardware issues</a> remain unresolved. Apparently, HP has decided that my two month old laptop with the cracked display is <em>not</em> covered under warranty. Of course, since I have a wide variety of accessories compatible with this machine, I'm unlikely to scrap it even though they are charging my group a significant portion of the original cost (&gt; 50%) to fix it.

As you can imagine, this is the last HP machine I will ever use. Granted, that doesn't mean much to HP's bottom line - I just got this machine when I switched jobs so I'm not due for a refresh for a while. I don't run the lab, so I don't have any say over the hardware they run in there. But I am in the market for a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter">Media Center PC</a> - luckily there are a variety of other OEMs who offer MCE (the <a href="http://www.viewsonic.com/products/mediacntr_m2000.htm">Viewsonic</a> looks cool).

People like <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> scour the 'net to find people who have "fired" Microsoft. We are doing a better listening to them (note, I'm not suggesting we're done listening or that we've fixed all the issues - just that we're improving). I hope HP has someone looking for people who have fired them.
