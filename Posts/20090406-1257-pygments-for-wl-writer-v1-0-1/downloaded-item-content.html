<p>I just replaced the original v1.0.0 Pygments for WL Writer installer with a new and improved v1.0.1. The <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Pygments%20for%20WL%20Writer/Pygments.WLWriter.msi">original URL</a> still works &#8211; I archived the old version off with a new name. <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/pygments.wlwriter/tree/v1.0.1">Updated source</a> is available on on GitHub.</p>
<p>The only change is that I now override <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa738912.aspx">OnSelectedContentChanged</a> in the sidebar control. That way, if I have multiple blocks of pygmented code in a given post, the sidebar UI updates with the correct language and color scheme of the currently selected code block. </p>
