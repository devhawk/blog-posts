For several hours on Saturday, we thought we were going to have to put our dog D&#8217;art down. <a href=\"http:\/\/techiewife.spaces.live.com\/blog\/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!605.entry\">My wife has the details<\/a>, but the good news is that he had spine trauma, but nothing broken and he seems to be back on his way to his old self.<\/li>\n<li>I grew up in <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.live.com\/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=38.936518~-77.184293&amp;style=r&amp;lvl=13&amp;tilt=-90&amp;dir=0&amp;alt=-1000&amp;sp=Point.rybfsj4tq2g9_7332%20166th%20Ave%20NE%2c%20Redmond%2c%20WA%2098052%2c%20United%20States___\">Northern Virginia<\/a>, so I&#8217;m a long time member of the Dallas Cowboy Hater&#8217;s Club. So watching them <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nfl\/recap?gameId=270106026\">snatch defeat from the jaws of victory<\/a> against my adopted Seahawks was sweet.<\/li>\n<li>Last night, Bill Gates <a href=\"http:\/\/microsoftatces.com\/archive\/2007\/01\/07\/2007-international-ces-keynote.aspx\">kicked off CES<\/a>\u00a0with the usual assortment of product news and announcements. The biggest news, in my opinion anyway, is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/press\/2007\/jan07\/01-08IPTVXboxPR.mspx\">IPTV support for Xbox 360<\/a>. (Did you know MSFT has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/tv\">TV product division<\/a>?) Details are fairly scarce at this point, but I&#8217;m hoping this allows for independent broadcasters to directly reach consumers, much like blogs have done for independent writers. Can I use IPTV to launch my own TV channel? Imagine the possibilities. I&#8217;d like a Washington Capitals channel, so I can watch <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtoncaps.com\/news\/news.asp?story_id=4489\">post game highlights<\/a> on my big screen TV rather than on my computer. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.roosterteeth.com\/\">Rooster Teeth<\/a> channel would also be nice.<\/li>\n<li>No coding this past weekend, though I did reinstall <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/directx\/XNA\/default.aspx\">XNA Game Studio Express<\/a> on my recently paved dev partition. I tried playing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/legostarwars2\/\">Lego Star Wars II<\/a> with my son over the weekend and he&#8217;s still having trouble learning how to use the controller. I was thinking I might try making some simple &#8220;games&#8221; to help him learn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh LordI&#8217;ve been waiting for this moment, all my life, oh LordCan you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh LordIn The Air Tonight by Phil CollinsCovered by Nonpoint on the Miami Vice Soundtrack It was a tough weekend in the Pierson house.
