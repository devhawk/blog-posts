<li>It was a tough weekend in the Pierson house. For several hours on Saturday, we thought we were going to have to put our dog D&#8217;art down. <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!605.entry">My wife has the details</a>, but the good news is that he had spine trauma, but nothing broken and he seems to be back on his way to his old self.</li>
<li>I grew up in <a href="http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=38.936518~-77.184293&style=r&lvl=13&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&sp=Point.rybfsj4tq2g9_7332%20166th%20Ave%20NE%2c%20Redmond%2c%20WA%2098052%2c%20United%20States___">Northern Virginia</a>, so I&#8217;m a long time member of the Dallas Cowboy Hater&#8217;s Club. So watching them <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270106026">snatch defeat from the jaws of victory</a> against my adopted Seahawks was sweet.</li>
<li>Last night, Bill Gates <a href="http://microsoftatces.com/archive/2007/01/07/2007-international-ces-keynote.aspx">kicked off CES</a>&nbsp;with the usual assortment of product news and announcements. The biggest news, in my opinion anyway, is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/jan07/01-08IPTVXboxPR.mspx">IPTV support for Xbox 360</a>. (Did you know MSFT has a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/tv">TV product division</a>?) Details are fairly scarce at this point, but I&#8217;m hoping this allows for independent broadcasters to directly reach consumers, much like blogs have done for independent writers. Can I use IPTV to launch my own TV channel? Imagine the possibilities. I&#8217;d like a Washington Capitals channel, so I can watch <a href="http://www.washingtoncaps.com/news/news.asp?story_id=4489">post game highlights</a> on my big screen TV rather than on my computer. A <a href="http://www.roosterteeth.com/">Rooster Teeth</a> channel would also be nice.</li>
<li>No coding this past weekend, though I did reinstall <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/XNA/default.aspx">XNA Game Studio Express</a> on my recently paved dev partition. I tried playing <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/legostarwars2/">Lego Star Wars II</a> with my son over the weekend and he&#8217;s still having trouble learning how to use the controller. I was thinking I might try making some simple &#8220;games&#8221; to help him learn.</li>
