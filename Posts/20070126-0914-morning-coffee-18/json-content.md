-   I’m sure glad [Heroes](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes) is back. And so
    far, I’m liking this season of [24](http://www.fox.com/24) better
    than the last couple. I especially like how they’re introducing
    Jack’s family to the storyline – very cool.
-   Bill Gates [will be
    on](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/301067_msfthype25.html)[The
    Daily Show with Jon
    Stewart](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml)
    next Monday. I rarely miss an episode (though I typically watch it a
    day or two later via my DVR) so I’m looking forward to this.
-   Roger Sessions latest [ObjectWatch
    newsletter](http://www.objectwatch.com/newsletters/ObjectWatchNewsletter054.pdf)
    is available. Roger does his usual brand of relating architectural
    concepts to everyday situations (this time, planning his daughter’s
    wedding). This one was funnier than most – especially since I have a
    1 year old daughter – though I’m still waiting for one of these that
    doesn’t contain the words “doppio machiato”. If you’re reading this
    Roger, don’t worry, I *am* enjoying every moment.
-   Apparently, I am the keeper of obscure development knowledge on my
    team. My teammate Buzz was getting an error in shdocvw.dll when
    trying to open an XSD with the BizTalk editor. He’s on an interim
    build of [BTS06
    R2](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-06EtEBusinessProcessPR.mspx),
    so bugs are to be expected, but he wasn’t sure what shdocvw was, so
    he asked me. In case you’re curious, shdocvw is the [WebBrowser
    control](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa752040.aspx).
-   Did I mention that I left my laptop power cord at the office *again*
    on Tuesday? That’s three times in four the last five trips to my
    office (not counting weekends, sick days and training). My boss
    actually got a spare from *his* boss that I can leave at the house
    24/7.
