In these scenarios, part of the application is built in IronPython other parts are build in compiled, statically typed languages like C# or Visual Basic. Sometimes, programs are written this way to allow the C# app to access a Python library, like my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/04/05/Pygments+For+Windows+Live+Writer.aspx">Pygments for WL Writer</a> plugin. Other programs want to be customizable by the end user, like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/intellipad/archive/2008/11/11/newbie-experience-writing-a-custom-command.aspx">Intellipad</a>. Whatever the reason, I think that the number of these hybrid polyglot programs is going up, which partially explains why the C# team added the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264741(VS.100).aspx">new dynamic type</a> to C# 4.0.</p><p>(FYI: the <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/you_had_me_at_dynamic_shirt-235421109922997983">You had me at “dynamic”</a> shirt above is available for sale in my Zazzle store along with my <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/architecture_help_dark_t_shirt-235848130425737882">Architecture Help 5¢</a> shirt)</p><p>The thing is that if you’re going to build polyglot apps, you’re probably going to want the ability to debug polyglot apps as well. I’ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/02/27/Writing+An+IronPython+Debugger+Introduction.aspx">written extensively</a> about building a debugger for IronPython. However, <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/ipydbg/">ipydbg</a> uses the CLR debugger under the hood which means you have to have the debugger and the code it’s debugging in separate processes. That’s a huge design burden for building a debuggable polyglot application. Luckily, as of IronPython 2.6, we support Python’s built-in trace debugging capability (aka <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.settrace">sys.settrace</a>). While you can use this in pure Python apps (like <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html">PDB</a>), you can also use it polyglot C# (or VB)/IronPython apps as well. If only someone were to take the time to build a sample and document what he did along the way…</p><p>Hey, that sounds like PM work!</p><p>Seriously, let me introduce you to the worlds simplest Twitter application: GetThings. The app downloads a list of my tweets via the Twitter API and displays them in a list box. The UI is written in C# while the tweet download code is written in Python. Clearly, this is a pretty brain dead app – but the point isn’t to build a great Twitter app but rather to show how to use the settrace API from C#.</p><p>I’ve stuck the <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/LightweightDebuggerDemo">code up on GitHub</a>. If you want to see the basic app in action sans debugging, start with the <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/LightweightDebuggerDemo/commit/92bd5fc330e2a48ae84fc185f3e397aefb4be1eb">initial checkin</a>. As you can see here, basic C# / IronPython integration is pretty trivial. I’m simply creating an engine and a scope, adding the list boxes’ Items property to the scope, and executing the getthings.py file from the disk.</p><pre class="brush: csharp">
private void Window_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    ScriptEngine engine = Python.CreateEngine();
    ScriptScope  scope = engine.CreateScope();
    scope.SetVariable("items", lbThings.Items);
    engine.ExecuteFile("getthings.py", scope);
}
</pre><p>Since GetThings.py is just a text file, the user can modify it to get a list of anything they want – some other user’s timeline, the public timeline, or even – gasp! – something not from Twitter! In fact, as you see below, I’ve actually modified it to pull the tweets from a file on disk so I can avoid hitting the network on every run.</p><pre class="brush: python">
import clr
clr.AddReference("System.Xml")
from System.Xml import XmlDocument

def get_nodes(xml):
    return xml.SelectNodes("statuses/status/text")

def download_stuff():
    x = XmlDocument()

    #load from disk to save time in development
    #x.Load("http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/devhawk.xml")
    x.Load("devhawk.xml")

    for n in get_nodes(x):
        txt = n.InnerText
        items.Add(txt)

download_stuff()
</pre><p>OK, so that’s the basics of the world’s simplest hybrid C#/IronPython Twitter application. Next up, I’ll add the settrace basics.</p>
