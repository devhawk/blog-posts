I [posted
yesterday](PermaLink.aspx?guid=38da8ea9-5ac2-4b38-ac2f-1572fad62eee)
about wanting a filtered version of aggregate RSS feeds. I take it back!
I want my RSS news aggregator client to be filter enabled, not the
service providing the aggregate feed. What was I thinking? Since I’ve
signed up as a member of [RSS
Bandit](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=cb8d3173-9f65-46fe-bf17-122e3703bb00)
(and just got accepted as a member of
[Harvester](http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=781a211f-bf3a-4d26-b5cc-6d32aaa93cd0))
I’ll look into adding the feature myself. Also, [Sam
Ruby](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1317.html) pointed out [Luke
Hutteman’s](http://www.hutteman.com) [SharpReader](http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/06.html#000056)
which looks like it allows you to view a post in context with other
posts like a threaded conversation. Cool, I’ll have to check that out.

On an RSS related note, thanks
[Dare](http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/Carnage4Life/diary) and
[Don](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/) for pointing out
[SgmlReader](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=B90FDDCE-E60D-43F8-A5C4-C3BD760564BC)
to me. I just built a simple utility to download my weblog DB into an
XML file, including converting the HTML -\> XHTML (though I still need
to do some namespace conversion work). As such, I don’t see the need for
my HtmlReader. However, I will be keeping the code around and will even
be updating it soon with a bug fix from [Chad
Osgood](http://dotnetweblogs.com/cosgood).
