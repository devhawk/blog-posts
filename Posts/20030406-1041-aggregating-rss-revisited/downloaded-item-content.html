<p align="left">I <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=38da8ea9-5ac2-4b38-ac2f-1572fad62eee"> posted yesterday</a> about wanting a filtered version of aggregate RSS feeds. I take it back! I want my RSS news aggregator client to be filter enabled, not the service providing the aggregate feed. What was I thinking? Since I&#8217;ve signed up as a member of <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=cb8d3173-9f65-46fe-bf17-122e3703bb00"> RSS Bandit</a> (and just got accepted as a member of <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=781a211f-bf3a-4d26-b5cc-6d32aaa93cd0"> Harvester</a>) I&#8217;ll look into adding the feature myself. Also, <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1317.html">Sam Ruby</a> pointed out <span class="description"><a href="http://www.hutteman.com">Luke Hutteman&#8217;s</a></span><a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/06.html#000056">SharpReader</a> which looks like it allows you to view a post in context with other posts like a threaded conversation. Cool, I&#8217;ll have to check that out.</p>
<p align="left">On an RSS related note, thanks <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/Carnage4Life/diary">Dare</a> and <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/">Don</a> for pointing out <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=B90FDDCE-E60D-43F8-A5C4-C3BD760564BC"> SgmlReader</a> to me. I just built a simple utility to download my weblog DB into an XML file, including converting the HTML -&gt; XHTML (though I still need to do some namespace conversion work). As such, I don&#8217;t see the need for my HtmlReader. However, I will be keeping the code around and will even be updating it soon with a bug fix from <a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/cosgood">Chad Osgood</a>.</p>
