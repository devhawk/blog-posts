FYI, I’m at TechEd all next week. Given that WiFi access at conferences
usually blows, I’m not planning on regular morning coffee posts. I’ve
asked [Dale](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/) again to keep the
lights on around here and he’s graciously said yes. Since I’m not on
vacation, I’ll be lurking around as well, but I’ll be in an out. See you
in Orlando!

    that developers are their own worst enemy, because they write too
    much code. Add in a pinch of “not invented here” syndrome and I
    think you’ve got it. This is one of the reasons why people think
    Ruby is [the
    tits](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProgrammerIntentOrWhatYoureNotGettingAboutRubyAndWhyItsTheTits.aspx).

    about the thunderous REST bandwagon. He doesn’t explicitly say it,
    but my take is that he thinks this all ends up in some middle ground
    between REST and WS-\*. I hear that, at least, if that’s what he’s
    saying. I’m not sold on “HTTP is all you need” – I need
    [durability](http://devhawk.net/2007/05/30/The+Case+For+Durable+Messaging+In+Service+Orientation.aspx)
    and async messaging, but I don’t see how to get there from here with
    just HTTP.
