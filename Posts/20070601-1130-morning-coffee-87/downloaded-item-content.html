<p>FYI, I&#8217;m at TechEd all next week. Given that WiFi access at conferences usually blows, I&#8217;m not planning on regular morning coffee posts. I&#8217;ve asked <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/">Dale</a> again to keep the lights on around here and he&#8217;s graciously said yes. Since I&#8217;m not on vacation, I&#8217;ll be lurking around as well, but I&#8217;ll be in an out. See you in Orlando!</p>

<li>Jeff Atwood <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000878.html">proclaims</a> that developers are their own worst enemy, because they write too much code. Add in a pinch of &#8220;not invented here&#8221; syndrome and I think you&#8217;ve got it. This is one of the reasons why people think Ruby is <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProgrammerIntentOrWhatYoureNotGettingAboutRubyAndWhyItsTheTits.aspx">the tits</a>.  </li>
<li>Scott Hanselman has already taken advantage of the new WLWriter <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb463266.aspx">provider customization API</a>.  </li>
<li>Erik Johnson <a href="http://appside.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-do-bandwagons-fit-into-project-plan.html">writes</a> about the thunderous REST bandwagon. He doesn&#8217;t explicitly say it, but my take is that he thinks this all ends up in some middle ground between REST and WS-*. I hear that, at least, if that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s saying. I&#8217;m not sold on &#8220;HTTP is all you need&#8221; &#8211; I need <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/30/The+Case+For+Durable+Messaging+In+Service+Orientation.aspx">durability</a> and async messaging, but I don&#8217;t see how to get there from here with just HTTP. </li>
