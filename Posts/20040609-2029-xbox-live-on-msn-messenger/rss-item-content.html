<p>I've been playing a bunch of Rallisport Challenge 2 since I got back from <span id="rssHarry_dgFeed__ctl3_lblItem">Tech·Ed. I haven't seen many of my Xbox friends online when I've been online, but I just setup the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/live/about/features-messenger.htm">MSN Messenger / Xbox Live integration</a>. Cool idea, but none of my friends are online right now, so there's not really anything to see, yet. </span></p><p><span>On a similar note, <a href="http://www.addressof.com/blog/">Cory</a> (who provided my <a href="http://devhawk.net/themes/devhawk/images/gamertag.gif">Xbox Live Flair</a>) has an app called <a href="http://www.xboxfriends.com/xboxfriends.aspx">Xbox Friends</a> where you can see your friends playing habits in addition to their current status. For those who don't have it, I can save you the bother of installing it to find out my habits - all <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/rallisportchallenge2/default.htm">Rallisport Challenge 2</a> all the time!</span></p><p><span>Update - I also signed up for <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/alerts/alertsintro.htm">Xbox Live Alerts</a> as well. This isn't as useful as there are a wide variety of alerts types and I have to have one delivery profile for all of them. I want to be notified in email if there is new downloads, but on MSN Messenger if a friend logs in. This appears to be an <a href="http://alerts.msn.com">MSN Alerts</a> wide issue - alert settings are per alert provider, not per alert type. Not very useful to be notified in email that a friend was online...yesterday.</span></p>
