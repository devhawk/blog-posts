I’ve been playing a bunch of Rallisport Challenge 2 since I got back
from Tech·Ed. I haven’t seen
many of my Xbox friends online when I’ve been online, but I just setup
the [MSN Messenger / Xbox Live
integration](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/live/about/features-messenger.htm).
Cool idea, but none of my friends are online right now, so there’s not
really anything to see, yet. 

On a similar note, [Cory](http://www.addressof.com/blog/) (who
provided my [Xbox Live
Flair](http://devhawk.net/themes/devhawk/images/gamertag.gif)) has an
app called [Xbox Friends](http://www.xboxfriends.com/xboxfriends.aspx)
where you can see your friends playing habits in addition to their
current status. For those who don’t have it, I can save you the bother
of installing it to find out my habits – all [Rallisport Challenge
2](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/rallisportchallenge2/default.htm) all the
time!

Update - I also signed up for [Xbox Live
Alerts](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/alerts/alertsintro.htm) as well. This
isn’t as useful as there are a wide variety of alerts types and I have
to have one delivery profile for all of them. I want to be notified in
email if there is new downloads, but on MSN Messenger if a friend logs
in. This appears to be an [MSN Alerts](http://alerts.msn.com) wide issue
– alert settings are per alert provider, not per alert type. Not very
useful to be notified in email that a friend was
online…yesterday.
