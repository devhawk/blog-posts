-   I am apparently stuck with my wife’s rants. That’s fine, as long as
    she has continues to [stand up and
    rant](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!624.entry)
    about the things she and I believe in.
-   I hate wearing suits for the same reasons [Mark Cuban
    does](http://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/01/16/why-i-dont-wear-a-suit-and-cant-figure-out-why-anyone-does/).
-   [According to Joe
    McKendrick](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=799) (of
    JBOWS fame), “many IT executives simply do not have the resources or
    political clout to get SOA moving in a big way that will transform
    the business.” I guess that blows a huge hole in Thomas Erl’s [CIO
    as Dictator
    approach](http://devhawk.net/2006/09/27/thoughts-on-the-soa-workshop/).
-   I don’t have a Wii (yet) but [this
    game](http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4547&Itemid=2)
    seems pretty cool for the little ones. Patrick is getting pretty
    good at Lego Star Wars, but this would be right up Riley’s alley.

-   I’m in BizTalk 2006 training today and tomorrow, so blogging will be
    light and BTS focused. Class is being taught by [Matt
    Milner](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/matt/) from
    [PluralSight](http://pluralsight.com/), so I’m looking forward to
    it.
