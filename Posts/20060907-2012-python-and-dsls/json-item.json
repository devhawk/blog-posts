I went thru a very similar thought process when I discovered the early versions of IronPython were written in Python. I figured that meant Python must have some support that makes building compilers easier. Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t turn out to be the case.\u00a0Python provides a <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.python.org\/lib\/module-parser.html\">standard module called parser<\/a> which &#8220;provides an interface to Python&#8217;s internal parser&#8221;. That means that compiling Python is easy, but there&#8217;s no support for compiling any language other than Python. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a little experimenting in this space. First, as I&#8217;ve <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/08\/15\/Modular+Compilers.aspx\">written before<\/a>, I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href=\"http:\/\/pdos.csail.mit.edu\/~baford\/packrat\/\">parsing expression grammars<\/a>. Second, I want to take a close look at <a href=\"http:\/\/plas.fit.qut.edu.au\/metaphor\/\">Metaphor<\/a>\u00a0from <a href=\"http:\/\/plas.fit.qut.edu.au\/Default.aspx\">QUT<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Metaphor is a programming language with support for type-safe run-time code generation &#8212; a form of meta-programming. Metaphor is based on a subset of C# or Java and combines the imperative, object-oriented nature of these languages with the multi-stage programming constructs from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metaocaml.org\">MetaOCaml<\/a>. Metaphor uses the static type system of multi-stage languages to achieve compile-time safety of run-time generated code&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Metaphor is implemented as a compiler on the Microsoft CLR.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Finally, I need to take a closer look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.antlr.org\/\">ANTLR<\/a>. Don&#8217;t know how I missed it, but I had never seen <a href=\"http:\/\/www.antlr.org\/works\/\">ANTLRWorks<\/a> until Larry linked to it. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>When I read Larry O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s post IronPython as a Foundation for DSLs, I had a strong sense of deja-vu.
