<p>When I read <a href="http://www.knowing.net/">Larry O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s</a> post <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,fde14e86-4d1e-461d-9751-950a1f2e6974.aspx">IronPython as a Foundation for DSLs</a>, I had a strong sense of deja-vu. I went thru a very similar thought process when I discovered the early versions of IronPython were written in Python. I figured that meant Python must have some support that makes building compilers easier. Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t turn out to be the case.&nbsp;Python provides a <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-parser.html">standard module called parser</a> which &#8220;provides an interface to Python&#8217;s internal parser&#8221;. That means that compiling Python is easy, but there&#8217;s no support for compiling any language other than Python. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a little experimenting in this space. First, as I&#8217;ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/08/15/Modular+Compilers.aspx">written before</a>, I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/">parsing expression grammars</a>. Second, I want to take a close look at <a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/metaphor/">Metaphor</a>&nbsp;from <a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/Default.aspx">QUT</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Metaphor is a programming language with support for type-safe run-time code generation &#8212; a form of meta-programming. Metaphor is based on a subset of C# or Java and combines the imperative, object-oriented nature of these languages with the multi-stage programming constructs from <a href="http://www.metaocaml.org">MetaOCaml</a>. Metaphor uses the static type system of multi-stage languages to achieve compile-time safety of run-time generated code&#8230;</p>
<p>Metaphor is implemented as a compiler on the Microsoft CLR.</p>

<p>Finally, I need to take a closer look at <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a>. Don&#8217;t know how I missed it, but I had never seen <a href="http://www.antlr.org/works/">ANTLRWorks</a> until Larry linked to it. </p>
