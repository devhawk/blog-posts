<p>Microsoft-Watch jumped on the blog bandwagon by creating a list of <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,4248,852932,00.asp">MSFT bloggers</a>. It&#8217;s been very popular &#8211; I&#8217;ve had 467 referrals from them since they posted the list. Apparently, there&#8217;s also a <a href="https://ziffdavis.omeda.com/zm/msw/msw.cgi?intro2&p=5BZWA00082"> newsletter</a>, which had its latest issue come out on this past Friday. A friend sent me a copy indicating that &#8220;Dude, you&#8217;re famous&#8221;. They quoted my recent <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=dfc79478-f78f-4c4c-b105-02efd3d5a058">blog entry</a> regarding InfoPath as a developer tool almost entirely. They mention <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/Carnage4Life/diary">Dare</a> and <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/">Don</a> and the work they&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/7b48b6ab-d51f-447c-87bb-b02010e171af"> doing</a> in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnexxml/html/xml02172003.asp"> blogspace</a>, but don&#8217;t quote any of them. They only quoted the guy with something slightly negative to say.</p>
<p>In a way, this is to be expected. I mean, I&#8217;m following Rule #1 of <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Robert Scoble&#8217;s</a><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/02/26.html">Corporate Weblog Manifesto</a>: Tell The Truth. And nobody reads a news letter like Microsoft-Watch to only hear how great things are going for Microsoft. I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that they quoted me. (I am, however, surprised at the turnaround performance &#8211; I only posted the entry about 24 hours before it ended up in the newsletter.) And certainly, if I&#8217;m going to keep a blog like this, the press should be allowed to quote from it. However, I feel that should have received a heads up email to let me know I was being quoted out of context with the rest of the blog-thread in a newsletter that people pay for. Unlike many of the other MSFT bloggers, I work in the field directly with customers every day. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve got a customer or two who will see this. If my friend hadn&#8217;t clued me in, I might have been in for a nasty surprise when I return from Infant Care Leave this coming week.</p>
