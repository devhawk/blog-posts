Being off work yesterday (vacation time: use it or lose it), I fired up the ol&#8217; 360 to have a look see for myself. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0434409\/\">V for Vendetta<\/a> in HD? Cool. 6GB? Not so cool. Guess I&#8217;ll have to blow away some of the demos that I&#8217;m not playing in order to make space.\n<\/p>\n<p>The amount of HD space needed for HD movies begs the question, why isn&#8217;t Video Marketplace available for PC? My 20GB of Xbox HD space is taken up with game demos and downloads. But my home PC(s) can spare that kind of space. I&#8217;d much rather download the content to my PC then stream it across my home network to the 360 when I want to watch it. Not sure how DRM (I assume the content uses WM DRM) impacts network streaming, but I would guess that&#8217;s a solvable problem.\n<\/p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m talking about DRM, why do I have to pay to download DRMed rental content? Shouldn&#8217;t I pay when it&#8217;s time to actually watch the content? I understand having a time limit (24 hours) to <em>finish<\/em> watching content I rented, but why is there a time limit (14 days) to <em>start<\/em> watching it? Once it&#8217;s downloaded it, I&#8217;m no longer using XBL resources, so why put any limit on it at all?\n<\/p>\n<p>The pricing model seems pretty much in line with iTunes and\/or Blockbuster. $2 to own a TV show, $3 to rent a &#8220;classic&#8221; movie, $4 to rent a new release movie, with a 50% markup for HD content ($3\/$4.50\/$6). While these prices are pretty typical, where&#8217;s the all-you-can-watch subscription plan? The all-you-can-listen model is one of the key values of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zune.net\/en-us\/meetzune\/zunepass.htm\">Zune<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.playsforsure.com\/\">PlaysForSure<\/a> services like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.napster.com\/\">Napster<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urge.com\">Urge<\/a> not to mention <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netflix.com\/\">NetFlix<\/a>. I&#8217;d probably scrap my premium channel cable plan if I could get an unlimited subscription to XBL Video Marketplace.\n<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d also like to see more content pricing tiers. Owning a 45 minute <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbs.com\/primetime\/csi\/\">CSI<\/a> for $2 seems pretty fair. But $2 for an 11 minute <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adultswim.com\/shows\/spaceghost\/index.html\">Space Ghost Coast to Coast<\/a> seems overpriced. And while I&#8217;m making requests, how about making it easy to buy an entire season of a given show \u2013 both from a pricing perspective (i.e. a discount for buying an entire season) as well as a user experience perspective (i.e. one click to buy the whole season).\n<\/p>\n<p>So all in all, a pretty cool service with some room for improvement. The availability of significant amounts of good HD content is a MAJOR winner for this service and a great foundation to build on. Like all things XBL related, I assume Video Marketplace will evolve over time. Can&#8217;t wait to see how it goes.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>As per Major Nelson&#8217;s blog, the XBL Video Marketplace went live yesterday.
