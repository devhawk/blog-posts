<p>I was at a MSFT event for the last 2 days on future VS.NET / .NET FX stuff (I'll avoid the pre-MSFT-<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a>-esque Longhorn-rocks-but-I-can't-talk-about-it-because-it's-NDA posts). I ran into a bunch of <a href="http://www.softwarelegends.com">Software Legends</a> who all knew me.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/">Don Box</a>, who made a big deal of <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=ace738c4-9a79-41a5-9b59-520a76b31e39"> remembering my name</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/">Chris Sells</a>, who knew me from my <a href="prj_messenger.aspx"> Messenger.NET</a> stuff I built on his <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#imcli">imcli</a> classes.</li><li><a href="http://www.wintellect.com/about/instructors.aspx?id=3">Jeffrey Richter</a>, who doesn't work for MSFT like Chris and Don, but has been consulting w/ the VS.NET team since early in the .NET FX dev cycle. I took an early class on .NET (Dec 2000) from Jeff.</li></ul><p>This is part of why I love working for MSFT. You add <a href="http://www.dilascia.com/">Paul DiLascia</a> (author of <a href="http://www.dilascia.com/wpp.htm">Windows++</a>) to that mix and you would have the core group of authors that helped me learn Win32, MFC, COM and ATL. I doubt my previous jobs would have afforded me this opportunity.</p>
