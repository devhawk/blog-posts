I was at a MSFT event for the last 2 days on future VS.NET / .NET FX
stuff (I’ll avoid the
pre-MSFT-[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/)-esque
Longhorn-rocks-but-I-can’t-talk-about-it-because-it’s-NDA posts). I ran
into a bunch of [Software Legends](http://www.softwarelegends.com) who
all knew me.

-   [Don Box](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/), who made a big deal
    of [remembering my
    name](http://devhawk.net/2003/06/04/don-on-xml-apis/).
-   [Chris Sells](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/), who knew me from
    my [Messenger.NET](prj_messenger.aspx) stuff I built on his
    [imcli](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#imcli) classes.
-   [Jeffrey
    Richter](http://www.wintellect.com/about/instructors.aspx?id=3), who
    doesn’t work for MSFT like Chris and Don, but has been consulting w/
    the VS.NET team since early in the .NET FX dev cycle. I took an
    early class on .NET (Dec 2000) from Jeff.

This is part of why I love working for MSFT. You add [Paul
DiLascia](http://www.dilascia.com/) (author of
[Windows++](http://www.dilascia.com/wpp.htm)) to that mix and you would
have the core group of authors that helped me learn Win32, MFC, COM and
ATL. I doubt my previous jobs would have afforded me this opportunity.
