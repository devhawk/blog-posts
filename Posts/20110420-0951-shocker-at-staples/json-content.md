My passion for the Washington Capitals is [well
documented](http://devhawk.net/tag/washington-capitals/). What you don’t
know is that I was actually a Los Angeles Kings fan before I was a
Capitals fan.

I wasn’t into hockey growing up, but I caught hockey fever when I was
going to college in southern California. That was the Gretzky era  – he
led them to the Stanley Cup finals the year after I graduated from USC –
and the Kings were the hottest ticket in town. But that era faded with
the 1994 lockout, bankruptcy, trading Gretzky to the Blues in 1996 and
missing the playoffs four years in a row. But unlike most of my
then-fellow Angelenos, I stayed on the Kings bandwagon.

In 1998, the Kings finally made it back to the playoffs, facing the St.
Louis Blues (Gretzky had moved on to the Rangers by then). The Kings had
lost the first two games in St. Louis, but held a 3-0 lead in the 3rd
period of Game \#3. Then this happened:

> span after defenseman Sean O’Donnell received a fighting major for

> goaltender Jamie Storr.
>
> Pascal Rheaume, Brett Hull and Pierre Turgeon scored goals to tie the

> rallied for a 4-3 victory Monday night to take a commanding 3-0 lead
> in their best-of-seven playoff series before a sellout crowd of 16,005
> at the Great Western Forum.

I was one of those 16,005. It was the ugliest feeling I have ever had
walking out of a hockey game.

I imagine the fans at the Staples Center last night are familiar with
it.

I watched the 2nd period last night at first with jubilation (Kings go
up 4-0 less than a minute into the period), then slight concern (Sharks
finally get on the board), then increasing concern (Sharks close the
game to 4-3), then relief (Kings score :15 seconds later to make it 5-3)
and finally horror (Sharks score twice in the last :90 seconds to tie
the game 5-5).

I couldn’t watch any more after that. I saw that it had gone to
overtime, but I didn’t know who won until I looked it up online this
morning.

Frozen Royalty calls it the “[Flop on
Figueroa](http://frozenroyalty.net/2011/04/20/frozen-royalty-audio-la-kings-turn-4-0-lead-into-flop-on-figueroa-in-game-3-vs-san-jose/)”.

heart](http://purplecrushedvelvet.blogspot.com/2011/04/i-believed-in-you-kings-you-broke-my.html).
Hockeywood calls it an “[epic
meltdown](http://lifeinhockeywood.com/2011/04/20/game-3.aspx)” but then
[suggests](http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq139/hockeywood/keepcalm.jpg)
Kings fans need to “Keep Calm and Carry On” because “One game a playoff
series does not make”.

Technically, that’s true – the Kings are only down 2-1 and have shown
[they can win in San
Jose](http://espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=310416018). But with momentum
shift of blowing a 4 goal lead, I don’t see how the Kings win this
series. I’d like to be wrong, but I don’t see how they win another game
this year, much less the series.
