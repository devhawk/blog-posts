<p>The other day, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/Experimenting+With+Podcasting.aspx">wished</a> my Zen Micro supported variable speed playback for podcast playback. I&#8217;ve got another feature request, this time for podcast recording. The Zen Micro <a href="http://www.nomadworld.com/products/zen_Micro/features.asp">features</a>&nbsp;include built in microphone and support for voice recording. But there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any way to hook up an external microphone. The built-in mic is fine for leaving messages for yourself, but it&#8217;s not high enough quality for podcasting &#8220;on the go&#8221;. Additionally, since I&#8217;m using WMP 10 instead of the app that comes with the Zen Micro, I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s any way to sync the recorded files back down to my PC, but I&#8217;m thinking that&#8217;s just a matter of geting <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/">Notmad Explorer</a> talking to my Zen Micro. </p>
<p>UPDATE &#8211; Sometime shortly after I blogged this, Adam curry <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/02/26#a2979">posted</a> an episode of DSC recorded&nbsp;on a Zen Micro that Sean <a href="http://blog.seanalexander.com/PermaLink,guid,a3fe0c9d-b320-4e08-a1e1-b3ab5426f24b.aspx">gave him</a>. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to listen yet, but I&#8217;m interested in how it sounds and how well it worked for Adam. Do you have to hold it near your mouth the whole time? I still wish I could use an external mic.</p>
