I&#8217;ve got another feature request, this time for podcast recording. The Zen Micro <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nomadworld.com\/products\/zen_Micro\/features.asp\">features<\/a>\u00a0include built in microphone and support for voice recording. But there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any way to hook up an external microphone. The built-in mic is fine for leaving messages for yourself, but it&#8217;s not high enough quality for podcasting &#8220;on the go&#8221;. Additionally, since I&#8217;m using WMP 10 instead of the app that comes with the Zen Micro, I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s any way to sync the recorded files back down to my PC, but I&#8217;m thinking that&#8217;s just a matter of geting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.redchairsoftware.com\/notmad\/\">Notmad Explorer<\/a> talking to my Zen Micro. <\/p>\n<p>UPDATE &#8211; Sometime shortly after I blogged this, Adam curry <a href=\"http:\/\/www.curry.com\/2005\/02\/26#a2979\">posted<\/a> an episode of DSC recorded\u00a0on a Zen Micro that Sean <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.seanalexander.com\/PermaLink,guid,a3fe0c9d-b320-4e08-a1e1-b3ab5426f24b.aspx\">gave him<\/a>. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to listen yet, but I&#8217;m interested in how it sounds and how well it worked for Adam. Do you have to hold it near your mouth the whole time? I still wish I could use an external mic.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The other day, I wished my Zen Micro supported variable speed playback for podcast playback.
