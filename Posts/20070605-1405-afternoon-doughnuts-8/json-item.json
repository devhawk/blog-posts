The data being passed, if the design is good, is a subset of the canonical data model needed to understand or interpret a particular business event.

I wasn&#8217;t actually thinking about presenting it from the middle point, but more from an overall view. I would think that the business would understand the process if it was named after what it does like create customer. Monitoring could then show the process from initiation to completion. You should then be able to drill down to each service along the way. I would consider this somewhat similar to how Amberpoint shows it.<\/p>\n","parent":0}],"attachments":[],"comment_count":2,"comment_status":"closed","custom_fields":{"dasblog_entryid":["24ce4607-02ed-40ff-944a-3cd9426cf085"],"dasblog_compressedtitle":["Afternoon+Doughnuts+8"],"dasblog_compressedtitleunique":["2007\/06\/05\/Afternoon+Doughnuts+8"]}},"previous_url":"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/06\/05\/a-rest-question\/","next_url":"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/06\/06\/teched-2007-day-three\/"}
