<p>At least <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView.aspx?guid=94fd77ca-75d5-487c-a759-8eb3efbc75fe">one person</a> was interested in an OPML of MSFT .NEAT and AE bloggers. So I hacked them out of my full blog roll and <a href="http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx">posted it</a> on my site. I will be keeping it up to date, so check back every once in a while. I added a link to it in my nav bar so it is always available.</p>
<p>I love dasBlog. I was able to make one small change to the web.config file and now the OPML file is addressable while still being easily managed via dasBlog&#8217;s blogroll editor. Sweet. </p>
