Tony&#8217;s Australian, which means he plays more <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avdf.com\/bio\/bio_goodhew.html\">rugby<\/a> than football, a fact that was clearly obvious as I blew past him and the rest of his team&#8217;s offensive line to sack the QB in the end zone for the safety that turned out to be the margin of victory. I&#8217;d love to see Tony start a blog. He&#8217;s been kicking around the .NET team so long he&#8217;s got a bunch of good stories to tell. I brought him to a .NET student user group meeting at U of Washington and he was awesome. I&#8217;m hoping that if I talk enough trash about him here, he&#8217;ll start a blog just to respond in kind.<\/p>\n<p>In other news, I need new business cards.
