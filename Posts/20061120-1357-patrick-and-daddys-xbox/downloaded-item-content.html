<p><img height="99" src=".\xboxlogo[12].gif" width="100" align="right"> Last night, after his sister had gone to bed, my three year old son Patrick and I spent some time playing on &#8220;daddy&#8217;s Xbox&#8221;. He wants <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/carsxbox360">Cars</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/vivapinata">Viva Pinata</a> for&nbsp;Christmas, but I fired up the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/sonicthehedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/marketplace/sonicthehedgehog/demo.htm">demo</a> and handed him the controller. He&#8217;s only three, so he would basically run around in a circle and jump until he fell off the very tall tower the demo starts on. He enjoyed it, but he was also a little discouraged because he wasn&#8217;t very good at the game.</p>
<p><img style="MARGIN: 0px 5px 0px 0px" height="57" src=".\vivapinatalogo[5].gif" width="137" align="left"> That got me thinking about what kind of games would be good for him.&nbsp;He&#8217;s not that good with the controller yet, so fighting bad guys or navigating a ledge on a tall tower are not great bets. Likewise, three year olds aren&#8217;t that good at focusing on a specific goal like &#8220;pick up all the rings&#8221; but would rather just explore the world. Viva Pinata sounds like it&#8217;s right on target for Patrick (plus, he likes the TV show). But what other games really fit the bill? Not many. Patrick loves Cars &#8211; he wants to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_McQueen">Lightning McQueen</a> so bad &#8211; but I&#8217;m not sure he&#8217;s going to be any good at the game. </p>
<p><img height="93" src=".\XnaLogo[11].gif" width="204" align="right">I wonder if there&#8217;s much of a market for pre-school console games? Probably not at the $50-60 price point, but as a $5 or $10 Xbox Live Arcade game? Maybe so. I&#8217;ve played around with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/XNA/default.aspx">XNA Game Studio</a>, but I haven&#8217;t really been inspired to build anything. Maybe I&#8217;ve been looking in the wrong place for inspiration!</p>
<p>Update: My father had a great suggestion. Patrick loves <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneychannel/playhouse/handymanny/index.html">Handy Manny</a> and <a href="http://www.bobthebuilder.com">Bob the Builder</a>, so how about some type of Mr. Fix It game where you can go around building and repairing stuff. Sort of Grand Theft Auto with tools, but for three year olds. </p>
