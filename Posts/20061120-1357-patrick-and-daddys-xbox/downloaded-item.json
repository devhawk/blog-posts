He wants <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/carsxbox360\">Cars<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/vivapinata\">Viva Pinata<\/a> for\u00a0Christmas, but I fired up the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/sonicthehedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/live\/marketplace\/sonicthehedgehog\/demo.htm\">demo<\/a> and handed him the controller. He&#8217;s only three, so he would basically run around in a circle and jump until he fell off the very tall tower the demo starts on. He enjoyed it, but he was also a little discouraged because he wasn&#8217;t very good at the game.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"MARGIN: 0px 5px 0px 0px\" height=\"57\" src=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/WindowsLiveWriter\/0995b2a57c40_9C5C\/vivapinatalogo[5].gif\" width=\"137\" align=\"left\" \/> That got me thinking about what kind of games would be good for him.\u00a0He&#8217;s not that good with the controller yet, so fighting bad guys or navigating a ledge on a tall tower are not great bets. Likewise, three year olds aren&#8217;t that good at focusing on a specific goal like &#8220;pick up all the rings&#8221; but would rather just explore the world. Viva Pinata sounds like it&#8217;s right on target for Patrick (plus, he likes the TV show). But what other games really fit the bill? Not many. Patrick loves Cars &#8211; he wants to be <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lightning_McQueen\">Lightning McQueen<\/a> so bad &#8211; but I&#8217;m not sure he&#8217;s going to be any good at the game. <\/p>\n<p><img height=\"93\" src=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/WindowsLiveWriter\/0995b2a57c40_9C5C\/XnaLogo[11].gif\" width=\"204\" align=\"right\" \/>I wonder if there&#8217;s much of a market for pre-school console games? Probably not at the $50-60 price point, but as a $5 or $10 Xbox Live Arcade game? Maybe so. I&#8217;ve played around with <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/directx\/XNA\/default.aspx\">XNA Game Studio<\/a>, but I haven&#8217;t really been inspired to build anything. Maybe I&#8217;ve been looking in the wrong place for inspiration!<\/p>\n<p>Update: My father had a great suggestion. Patrick loves <a href=\"http:\/\/disney.go.com\/disneychannel\/playhouse\/handymanny\/index.html\">Handy Manny<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bobthebuilder.com\">Bob the Builder<\/a>, so how about some type of Mr. Fix It game where you can go around building and repairing stuff. Sort of Grand Theft Auto with tools, but for three year olds. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Last night, after his sister had gone to bed, my three year old son Patrick and I spent some time playing on &#8220;daddy&#8217;s Xbox&#8221;.
