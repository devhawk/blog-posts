  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm missing hockey myself and like you am siding with the owners. The NHLPA is exhibiting what's wrong with Unions these days. If you can't stay in business then NO ONE gets paid! It seems to me that the Owners are willing to pay some very nice salaries but they just want "cost certainty". Again, from where I sit, food on the table is a good thing and the Owners aren't serving McDonalds.]]></wp:comment_content>
