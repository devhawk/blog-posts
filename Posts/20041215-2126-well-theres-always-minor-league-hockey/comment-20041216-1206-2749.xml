  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Everytime one of the major sports goes on strike, I ask myself, why don't we offer alternative programming. Why not a live feed of master Halo 2 players, in a league setting.

If the Leagues think their strike might offer a competitor an opening, they will be back on the Ice in no time. If we sit like lumps waiting, they have no incentive except each other greed to get them playing.

In every industry, true competition is 3 players. Sports is no different. Owners, player and a wild card.

Hmmm.... The Microsoft Borgies :)]]></wp:comment_content>
