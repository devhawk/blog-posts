No, I’m not referring to [this hilarious
line](http://viewaskew.com/sounds/clerks/37.wav) from Clerks. It’s my
birthday today – can you guess which one?

(note, there’s no real point to this post, except to have “I’m 37!?!” in
the title. Let’s just say I’m a big Kevin Smith fan. In case you haven’t
see Clerks, [most lines](http://viewaskew.com/clerks/sounds.html) from
that movie are NSFW. )

**Update** - David Ing’s son [broke his
arm](http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=01e087e8-0a58-4003-96cb-ed36bae3338d)
over the weekend. That led David to write “If you are away from your
family a lot then my advice would be to fix that as quickly as you
can.” +1 on that sentiment. I went from field architect evangelist
(travel requirement \~50%) to HQ architect evangelist (travel
requirement \~10%) when Patrick was born. Of course in MSIT, I almost
never travel, something my whole family appreciates. Something to be
thankful for as I turn a year older.
