<p>No, I&#8217;m not referring&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="http://viewaskew.com/sounds/clerks/37.wav">this hilarious line</a> from Clerks. It&#8217;s my birthday today &#8211; can you guess which one?</p>
<p>(note, there&#8217;s no real point to this post, except to have &#8220;I&#8217;m 37!?!&#8221; in the title. Let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m a big Kevin Smith fan. In case you haven&#8217;t see Clerks, <a href="http://viewaskew.com/clerks/sounds.html">most lines</a> from that movie are NSFW. )</p>
<p><strong>Update </strong>- David Ing&#8217;s son <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=01e087e8-0a58-4003-96cb-ed36bae3338d">broke his arm</a> over the weekend. That led David to write &#8220;If you are away from your family a lot then my advice would be to fix that as quickly as you can.&#8221; +1 on that sentiment. I went from field architect evangelist (travel requirement ~50%) to HQ architect evangelist (travel requirement ~10%) when Patrick was born. Of course in MSIT, I almost never travel, something my whole family appreciates. Something to be thankful for as I turn a year older.</p>
