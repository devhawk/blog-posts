I just read [Dare’s](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/) awesome
[article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnexxml/html/xml01142005.asp)
on [C-Omega](http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/). If I had any time
at all, I’d experiment with it to rewrite
[dasBlog](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblogce) (well, at least the
back end parts of dasBlog anyway). Of course, I don’t have any time at
all, so it’s not going to happen (well, at least I won’t make it happen)
