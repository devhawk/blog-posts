<p>I just read <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/">Dare&#8217;s</a> awesome <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnexxml/html/xml01142005.asp">article</a> on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/">C-Omega</a>. If I had any time at all, I&#8217;d experiment with it to rewrite <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblogce">dasBlog</a> (well, at least the back end parts of dasBlog anyway). Of course, I don&#8217;t have any time at all, so it&#8217;s not going to happen (well, at least I won&#8217;t make it happen)</p>
