<li>Monday @ <a href="http://www.xnagamefest.com/">Gamefest</a>, the XNA team <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/08/13/announcing-xna-game-studio-2-0.aspx">announced</a> XNA Game Studio 2.0. The two big new things are support for the entire VS product line (1.0 only works on VC# Express) and the addition of networking APIs. Let&#8217;s Kill Dave <a href="http://letskilldave.com/archive/2007/08/13/gamefest-quick-summary-day-1.aspx">has a good wrapup</a> of the announcements from Gamefest Day One.  </li>
<li>Speaking of Xbox 360, I played thru the demos of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/johnwoopresentsstranglehold/">Stranglehold</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a>. Two thumbs up on both. It&#8217;s gonna be an expensive year for Xbox gamers.  </li>
<li>Mark Cuban <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/08/13/solution-for-the-real-estate-market-take-your-house-public/" target="_blank">noodles on</a> taking your house public. &#8220;Why not create a market or exchange where homeowners can sell equity in their homes?&#8221; I&#8217;ve thought about this myself from time to time. However, Mark thinks making it happen would &#8220;probably take the country&#8217;s biggest banks working together&#8221;. I wonder if there&#8217;s a more Web 2.0 <a href="http://www.centernetworks.com/social-lending-web-2-0" target="_blank">social lending</a> approach that would work better.  </li>
<li>Jeff Atwood calls virtualization as &#8220;the next great frontier for computer security&#8221;. I agree 100%. But I don&#8217;t think the action is going to be in &#8220;full-machine&#8221; virtualization like Virtual PC. Rather, it&#8217;s going to be sandbox virtualization. Jeff mentions GreenBorder (now <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=241" target="_blank">part of Google</a>) but it&#8217;s not the only solution. Some time ago, Microsoft acquired <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/softgrid/default.mspx" target="_blank">SoftGrid</a> which uses sandbox virtualization for application deployment, but using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/softgrid/evaluation/virtualization.mspx" target="_blank">SystemGuard</a> for security sandboxing seems like a logical step.  </li>
<li>The WCF LOB Adapter SDK has released. Sonu Arora <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sonuarora/archive/2007/08/08/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk-is-now-generally-available-for-download.aspx" target="_blank">has the details</a>. As part of the Integration team @ MSIT, I have a feeling we&#8217;re going to become fairly familiar with this technology. (via <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/08/09/wcf-lob-adapters-sdk-is-available-for-download.aspx" target="_blank">Jesus Rodriguez</a>). </li>
<li>Speaking of Jesus, he <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/08/13/sca-committees.aspx" target="_blank">thinks</a> the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/news/oasis-news-2007-08-09.php" target="_blank">six new SCA4SOA committees</a> are &#8220;going to help&#8221;. Why? Because inventing technology in committee has turned out so well in the past?  </li>
<li>John deVadoss cements BPM&#8217;s fad du jour status by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2007/08/08/big-bpm-vs-little-bpm.aspx" target="_blank">contrasting</a> &#8220;big&#8221; BPM and &#8220;little&#8221; BPM. It&#8217;s fairly obvious to me that big *anything* just doesn&#8217;t work in the enterprise. But I worry that little *anything* doesn&#8217;t work that well either. So how long until someone (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/07/21/what-you-need-to-make-middle-out-soa-architecture-work.aspx" target="_blank">probably Nick</a>) starts arguing for &#8220;middle out&#8221; BPM? </li>
<li>David Bressler <a href="http://blogs.progress.com/soa_infrastructure/2007/08/thank-you-scott.html" target="_blank">wonders</a> &#8220;What is it about registries that everyone thinks is a panacea for all things SOA?&#8221; Amen, Brother! Joe McKendrick <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=937" target="_blank">claims</a> it&#8217;s required for governance, but then gets to what I think is the *real* reason for focus on registries: the &#8220;registry is a tangible offering&#8221; that vendors can sell. Just because it&#8217;s productizable doesn&#8217;t mean you need it.  </li>
<li>Hartmut Wilms <a href="http://www.innoq.com/blog/hw/2007/08/14/retire_the_tenets.html" target="_blank">responds</a> to my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/08/14/Retire+The+Tenets.aspx" target="_blank">retire the tenets</a> post, but he seems to contradict himself. On the one hand, he suggests that &#8220;the four tenets just expressed, what &#8220;almost&#8221; everybody outside the MS world knew already&#8221;. But then he goes on to dispute that the SO paradigm shift has even occurred! Hartmut, I&#8217;ll grant you that WCF (among other similar stacks) are way too focused on &#8220;you write the classes, we&#8217;ll handle the contracts and messages&#8221;. On the other hand, if you don&#8217;t provide a productive interface that most everyone can pick up and run with, the technology won&#8217;t get adopted in the first place.</li>
