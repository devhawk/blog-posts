  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The 4 Tenets were indoctrination about service-orientation and (I think) purposely aimed at a specific, large population of Microsoft-platform developers.  Think back to the time when – as Microsoft put it – 80% of developers on the Windows platform used VB.  The Tenets served a purpose in jolting mindshare away from RPC and distributed objects.  In my job, such principles had been around a while.  So, I generally thought that the Tenets were obvious (and, sure, a little incomprehensible).  

But despite giving the Tenets some benefit of the doubt, I thought David Ing’s Four Horsemen essay was wonderfully written and a spot-on review.  No, the Tenets aren’t really guidance, but I don’t think anyone is saying they have done more harm than good.  Now, bring on the flames reserved for those who take middle ground!
