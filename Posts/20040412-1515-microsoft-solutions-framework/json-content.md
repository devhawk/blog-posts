It’s been around a while, but I only just noticed the [Microsoft
Solutions Framework](http://www.microsoft.com/msf) website because they
just published their
[whitepapers](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A71AC896-1D28-45A4-880C-8B0CC8265C63&displaylang=en)
on the Download Center ([RSS feed](http://www.thundermain.com/rss/) for

From the
[overview](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/techguide/msf/msfovrvw.mspx),
MSF is:

> Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) is a deliberate and disciplined
> approach to technology projects based on a defined set of principles,
> models, disciplines, concepts, guidelines, and proven practices from
> Microsoft. This white paper introduces MSF and provides an overview of
> its foundational principles, core models, and essential disciplines,
> focusing on how their application contributes to the success of
> technology projects. Finally, the paper provides references for
> further information about MSF and references for guidance in
> implementing MSF within an organization. In an appendix, the paper
> briefly compares and contrasts MSF to other industry methodologies and
> standards and describes how MSF can be used in combination with them.

MSF includes two models –

and
[process](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/techguide/msf/msfpm31.mspx)
– as well as three management disciplines –

[risk](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/techguide/msf/msrmd11.mspx)
and
[readiness](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/techguide/msf/msfrmd11.mspx).
They also have a bunch of [MSF
templates](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=9D2016AD-6F8A-47F5-84FA-BEC389DB18C1&displaylang=en)
you can use in your own projects.

One of the nice things about MSF is that it works with other
methodologies. I.e. you don’t have to give up RUP/XP/TDD/\<insert your
favorite methodology here\> in order to use MSF.

UPDATE: Lorenzo has compiled a [list of MSF
