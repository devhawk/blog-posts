This white paper introduces MSF and provides an overview of its foundational principles, core models, and essential disciplines, focusing on how their application contributes to the success of technology projects. Finally, the paper provides references for further information about MSF and references for guidance in implementing MSF within an organization. In an appendix, the paper briefly compares and contrasts MSF to other industry methodologies and standards and describes how MSF can be used in combination with them.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"left\">MSF includes two models &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/technet\/itsolutions\/techguide\/msf\/msftm31.mspx\">team<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/technet\/itsolutions\/techguide\/msf\/msfpm31.mspx\">process<\/a> &#8211; as well as three management disciplines &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/technet\/itsolutions\/techguide\/msf\/msfpmd11.mspx\">project<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/technet\/itsolutions\/techguide\/msf\/msrmd11.mspx\">risk<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/technet\/itsolutions\/techguide\/msf\/msfrmd11.mspx\">readiness<\/a>.
