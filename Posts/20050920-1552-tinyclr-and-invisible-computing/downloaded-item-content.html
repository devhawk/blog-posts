<p>When I was at PDC, I saw the Phidgets folks in the Coding4Fun booth. Is it just me, or is this stuff dying to get merged with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/invisible/">MSR&#8217;s Invisible Computing</a> project? Haven&#8217;t heard of Invisible Computing? Here&#8217;s the description:</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"><p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/invisible/">This site</a> has the source code and documentation for Microsoft Invisible Computing. It is a research prototype for making small devices part of the seamless computing world. This site contains the source code and is available free of charge for research and educational use under the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/invisible/EULA.htm">Microsoft Shared Source License</a>. </p>
<p>Microsoft Invisible Computing consists of compact middleware for constructing embedded web services applications and a small component based Real-Time Operating System with TCP/IP networking to make middleware run straight on the metal on several embedded processors. </p>
<p>The goal is to make it easy to build custom smart devices and consumer electronics, especially battery operated; and to support research in invisible computing, operating systems, networking, ubiquitous computing, sensor nets, distributed systems, object-oriented design, and wireless communication. </p>

<p dir="ltr">FYI, I discovered the Invisible Computing project by <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=tinyclr">searching the web for TinyCLR</a>. TinyCLR is what powers the MSN Direct watch. From what I can tell (i.e. this is based on publicly discovered info) is that Invisible Computing is a shared source version of TinyCLR that works with a variety of hardware platforms. Sort of like a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=3A1C93FA-7462-47D0-8E56-8DD34C6292F0&displaylang=en">Rotor</a> for embedded devices. </p>
