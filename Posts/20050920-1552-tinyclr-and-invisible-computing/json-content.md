When I was at PDC, I saw the Phidgets folks in the Coding4Fun booth. Is
it just me, or is this stuff dying to get merged with [MSR’s Invisible
Computing](http://research.microsoft.com/invisible/) project? Haven’t
heard of Invisible Computing? Here’s the description:

> [This site](http://research.microsoft.com/invisible/) has the source
> code and documentation for Microsoft Invisible Computing. It is a
> research prototype for making small devices part of the seamless
> computing world. This site contains the source code and is available
> free of charge for research and educational use under the [Microsoft
> Shared Source
> License](http://research.microsoft.com/invisible/EULA.htm).
>
> Microsoft Invisible Computing consists of compact middleware for
> constructing embedded web services applications and a small component
> based Real-Time Operating System with TCP/IP networking to make
> middleware run straight on the metal on several embedded processors.
>
> The goal is to make it easy to build custom smart devices and consumer
> electronics, especially battery operated; and to support research in
> invisible computing, operating systems, networking, ubiquitous
> computing, sensor nets, distributed systems, object-oriented design,
> and wireless communication.

FYI, I discovered the Invisible Computing project by [searching the web
for TinyCLR](http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=tinyclr). TinyCLR is
what powers the MSN Direct watch. From what I can tell (i.e. this is
based on publicly discovered info) is that Invisible Computing is a
shared source version of TinyCLR that works with a variety of hardware
platforms. Sort of like a
[Rotor](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=3A1C93FA-7462-47D0-8E56-8DD34C6292F0&displaylang=en)
for embedded devices.
