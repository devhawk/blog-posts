Even though I said I'd try and lay off the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/">Patterns and Practices</a> blog entries for a while, I had a customer email me his thanks for posting these links. So I decided to update my site a little to add links to practices and application blocks that I think are a must read. They're now listed down the left hand side along with .NET links, .NET tools and the DevHawk Navigation menu. As new practices and application blocks are published, I'll be adding to this list as appropriate.
