His criteria were: 1) ease of use and 2) look of the final product. (Of course, look of the final product was important to Norman - he's in marketing!) As a developer and architect, I originally cared most about "rolling my own", though I switched over to dasBlog about a year ago. (I just don't have the time to roll-my-own as often as I used to.) However, given that I had invested significant effort into the look of my final product, that factor was important to me as well, which is one of the reasons I chose dasBlog over .TEXT.</p><p>Of course, what's funny about investing so much time thinking about the blog template is that I think most people read the site via RSS, not HTML. Chris Anderson of "The Long Tail" <a href="http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/blog_design_in_.html">wrote about this</a> a while back. Maybe I should invest a little effort into the new <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblogce">dasBlog Community Edition</a> effort - I'd like to see the number of times the RSS feed is downloaded vs. the number of times the home page is downloaded.</p><p>Norman further goes on to discuss the fact that his blog is hosted on Blogger, which of course is now owned by Google. I like his point that "Interoperability and mixed environments is the way the world works. If it is good enough for my customers, it is good enough for me."</p>]]></content:encoded>
