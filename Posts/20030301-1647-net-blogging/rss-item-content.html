I've been blogging with <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=3f81fcc8-03ab-4357-a60b-985d0242a1e3">Front Page as my front end</a>, but it looks like I'm going to have to investigate <a href="http://gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/spoutletex.aspx?key=2003-02-28T07:38:50Z"> InfoPath</a>. As .NET blogging tools grow up, I might need to move my site onto <a href="http://aspnetweblog.com/">ASPNetWeblog</a> or <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">BlogX</a>. I wonder how well these tools support customization. I've obviously got more than just blog up on this site.
