So this is nowhere near comprehensive.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clarius released the <a href=\"http:\/\/softwarefactoriestoolkit.net\/Download_JUN07CTP.aspx\">June 07 CTP<\/a> of their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.softwarefactoriestoolkit.net\/\">Software Factory Toolkit<\/a>. Big new feature in this drop is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.softwarefactoriestoolkit.net\/T4Editor_JUN07CTP.pdf.aspx\">T4 Text Template editor<\/a> that has syntax highlighting and eventually intellisense. They also released the May 07 CTP of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/vssdkassist\">VSSDK Assist<\/a>, previously known as VSIP Factory. Haven&#8217;t played with either yet, but it seems like a good time to be a tool builder.  <\/li>\n<li>PowerShell hits <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/powershell\/archive\/2007\/06\/04\/powershell-hits-a-million-downloads-in-the-first-six-months.aspx\">a million downloads in six months<\/a>. No surprise there, IT&#8217;S FRAKING AWESOME. Jeff Snover details seven MSFT products using PS, promising many more that he can&#8217;t talk about. See earlier comment about being fraking awesome.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of PS, I don&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsserver2008\/servercore.mspx\">Server Core<\/a>\u00a0because it doesn&#8217;t support managed code. So no PS for Server Core. They announced @ TechEd that Server Core will support IIS 7, but since there&#8217;s no CLR you can&#8217;t run ASP.NET. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, no PS and no ASP.NET is below the minimum threshold of usefulness. I realize it&#8217;s technical limitation related to the current factoring of the .NET Framework and I assume some team\u00a0somewhere in Redmond is working on fixing it. But what&#8217;s the point of releasing Server Core in the meantime?  <\/li>\n<li>QUT releases version 0.8 of their <a href=\"http:\/\/plas2003.fit.qut.edu.au\/Ruby.NET\/\">Ruby.NET compiler<\/a>. Given that the IronRuby guys <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iunknown.com\/2007\/06\/ironruby_and_ru.html\">bootstrapped<\/a> by licensing the Ruby.NET compiler, I wonder how these two projects will evolve side by side.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Ruby, <a href=\"http:\/\/jruby.codehaus.org\/\">JRuby<\/a> has <a href=\"http:\/\/ola-bini.blogspot.com\/2007\/06\/jruby-10.html\">gone 1.0<\/a>. Congrats!  <\/li>\n<li>At TechEd, I saw my friend Steve Jones from Capgemini, and it&#8217;s not this <a href=\"http:\/\/service-architecture.blogspot.com\/\">Steve Jones<\/a>.\u00a0Woops. But CRUD is still CRAP.  <\/li>\n<li>Pat Helland breaks Scott Hanselman&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/BlogInteresting32WaysToKeepYourBlogFromSucking.aspx\">Rule #2<\/a> and details how he &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/pathelland\/archive\/2007\/06\/10\/tmi-a-saga-of-weight-loss-exercise-tummy-tucks-and-health.aspx\">lost a Megan<\/a>&#8220;.  <\/li>\n<li>My ex-teammate David Hill has been busy with <a title=\"Acropolis\" href=\"http:\/\/windowsclient.net\/Acropolis\/Default.aspx\">Acropolis<\/a>. If you are even the slightest bit interested in this technology, you should be reading <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dphill\/\">his blog<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Microsoft acquired a company called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stratature.com\/\">Stratature<\/a> last week. I don&#8217;t typically track MSFT acquisition news + it was lost in the noise of TechEd. But Roger Wolter thinks it&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/rogerwolterblog\/archive\/2007\/06\/11\/master-data-management-microsoft-and-stratature.aspx\">great move<\/a>\u00a0and that Stratature&#8217;s Master Data Management hub product is one of the best. Given the importance of MDM in SOA, I think I need to go learn more about this product.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;ve got over 500 unread news posts and 200 emails in my inbox to process.
