<li>Mladen Prajdic has a <a href="http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/07/06/60250.aspx">great post</a> on handling a database in your unit tests. He mentions <a href="http://www.ndbunit.org/">NDbUnit</a> but seems mostly to favor SQL 2005&#8242;s database snapshot feature. He&#8217;s got sample code for creating and restoring a snapshot.

Tandy Trower &#8211; GM of the Robotics group &#8211; <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/robotics/bb625969.aspx">has the details</a> on what&#8217;s new.  </li>
<li>Herb Sutter has a <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/architect/200001985">new column</a> in Dr. Dobbs on concurrency. First up, &#8220;building a consistent mental model for reasoning about concurrency&#8221;. Sounds like a must read column. (via <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2339">LtU</a>) </li>
<li>Scott Hanselman <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SezYouArchitectureAndTheArchitectureNinja.aspx">describes</a> &#8220;Sez You Architecture&#8221;. I wonder, do architecture ninjas get to wear a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinobi_shozoku">Shinobi shozoku</a>? </li>
<li>From the Not Everyone Agrees With DevHawk Dept.: Libor Soucek <a href="http://lsblog.wordpress.com/2007/07/05/avoid-durable-messages-in-enterprise-services/">disagrees with me</a> and thinks that durable messaging should be avoided. I had a hard time following Libor&#8217;s logic but needless to say, I disagree with his disagreement. He writes that one of the reasons to use DM is for &#8220;Cooperating on transaction with external system&#8221;. While multiple systems may be cooperating on a <em>business</em> transaction, in no way do I believe they are going to cooperate on a <em>database</em> transaction. But since he started talking about <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684146.aspx">the DTC</a>, I suspect we&#8217;re talking past each other. Libor, <a href="mailto:harry dot pierson at microsoft dot com">drop me a line</a> and we can discuss further.</li>
