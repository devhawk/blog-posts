He is right that CASE was top-down, and that software creation analogies to manufacturing are of limited value. However, EA is fundamentally different to CASE. CASE was about using higher-order modeling to generate solutions. EA does not cover that area. I would argue that CASE has morphed into Software Factories\/DSLs. The DSL wave is an attempt to re-introduce higher-order models as a source for code generation in a more limited way, with less of the top-down &#8220;stone tablets&#8221; approach.<br \/>\nThe explanation that CASE failed because of &#8220;too many promises made by too many vendors&#8221; is deficient. That reason is a contributory factor to the failure of just about any recent I.T. technology failures; all vendors tend to over-sell new offerings (expansive hype gets you noticed in a crowded marketplace; modesty doesn&#8217;t). There are a collection of inter-related reasons why CASE failed, ranging from under-investment, through the impact of disruptive technologies in the 1990&#8242;s (client-server and the emergence of UML)&#8230;the list goes on. Over-selling by vendors is a very small part of the root causes. (I know&#8230;I was a CASE consultant for 8 years). <\/p>\n","parent":0}],"attachments":[],"comment_count":1,"comment_status":"closed","custom_fields":{"dasblog_entryid":["a22d39a4-4ce8-45c6-bcff-20aea4627b78"],"dasblog_compressedtitle":["Morning+Coffee+52"],"dasblog_compressedtitleunique":["2007\/03\/26\/Morning+Coffee+52"]}},"previous_url":"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/03\/23\/morning-coffee-51\/","next_url":"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/03\/27\/morning-coffee-53\/"}
