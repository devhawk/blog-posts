<li>I finally found a use for the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/09/27/Thoughts+On+The+SOA+Workshop.aspx">free SOA book I got</a> from attending that Thomas Erl workshop. I&#8217;m using it to prop up one end of my daughter&#8217;s mattress while she&#8217;s sick so she can sleep better.

<li>Jeff Tash states axiomatically that <a href="http://www.flashmapsystems.com/resources/articles/articles17.htm">CASE has evolved into Enterprise Architecture</a>.&nbsp;I agree with his points about why software construction isn&#8217;t like manufacturing, but he seems to be describing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDUF">BDUF</a>&nbsp;rather than EA. I&#8217;m anti-BDUF too, but why blame EA? (via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2007/03/24/case-and-enterprise-architecture.aspx">John deVadoss</a>)

<li>Joe McKendrick <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=839">comments</a> on my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/21/When+Is+A+Service+Not+A+Service.aspx">SaaS/SOA post</a> and wonders if SOA should stand for &#8220;SOA Oriented Architecture&#8221;. He also <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=840">writes</a> that most organizations these days don&#8217;t have an SOA, they have an AOS, &#8220;Agglomeration Of Services&#8221;. So true, so true.

<li>JD Meier <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmeier/archive/2007/03/26/vsts-guidance-project-update.aspx">talks up</a> the new <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/VSTSGuidance">VSTS guidance</a> available on CodePlex. Looks like some good stuff in there. I like how the p&amp;p guys are moving from documents to wikis to deliver their guidance.

<li>I&#8217;ve held off on getting the HD-DVD drive for my Xbox, but I think I&#8217;m going to cave soon, where soon == about two months. That&#8217;s when <a href="http://www.engadgethd.com/2007/03/21/matrix-trilogy-to-hit-hd-dvd-may-22nd-blu-ray-later-this-year/">The Matrix Trilogy</a> is released on HD-DVD. Right around my birthday too, how convienent. </li>
