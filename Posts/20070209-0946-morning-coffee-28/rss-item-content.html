<ul><li>From the "Ask and ye shall receive" department: A couple weeks ago <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/23/Morning+Coffee+16.aspx">I wondered</a> how good or bad my Gamerscore conversion rate is. <a href="http://www.mygamercard.net/">MyGamerCard.net</a> just launched a <a href="http://www.mygamercard.net/completionlb.php">completion leaderboard</a> where they rank you on your Gamerscore times your completion rate.  </li><li>Shane Courtrille <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,5f29bfa4-48e7-4092-a561-0b154973187f.aspx#commentstart">pointed out</a> that the prize you receive in from the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0205-xboxrewards.htm">Xbox Rewards</a> program gets better if your Gamerscore is higher. With a meager 1090 points, I'm in level 1. But those with 10,000+ or more can get a copy of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/fuzionfrenzy2xbox360/">Fuzion Frenzy 2</a> for completing the challenge.  </li><li>Yesterday, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/08/Morning+Coffee+27.aspx">complained</a> that code in my RSS feed looks awful. It appears to be a problem with dasBlog. In validating the HTML is actually XHTML, it screws up the white space. Of course, usually that's not a big deal, but inside a &lt;pre&gt; tag, it is. Until I get a chance to submit a patch to dasBlog to fix this, I'm using <a href="http://puzzleware.net/codehtmler/">CodeHTMLer</a>, which has a "convert white space" option that doesn't use the &lt;pre&gt; tag at all. As a bonus, it even support PowerShell! Note, you have to use the <a href="http://puzzleware.net/codehtmler/default.aspx">website</a>, not their <a href="http://puzzleware.net/download.aspx?file=/codehtmler/codehtmler.livewriterplugin.zip">WLWriter plugin</a>, if you want the convert white space option. </li><li>There's a new beta of <a href="http://www.plas.fit.qut.edu.au/Ruby.NET/">Ruby.NET</a> available. Now that I've moved on to PowerShell, I'm only slightly interested in Ruby these days. If I can figure out how to create internal DSLs with PS, what would I need Ruby for? (via <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg7/TheDailyGrind1075.aspx">Larkware</a>) </li><li><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/architecture">My old team</a> just shipped a single-instance multi-tenancy SaaS sample called <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb229292">LitwareHR</a>.
