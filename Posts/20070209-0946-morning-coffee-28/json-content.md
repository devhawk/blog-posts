-   From the “Ask and ye shall receive” department: A couple weeks ago
    [I wondered](http://devhawk.net/2007/01/23/Morning+Coffee+16.aspx)
    how good or bad my Gamerscore conversion rate is.
    [MyGamerCard.net](http://www.mygamercard.net/) just launched a
    [completion
    leaderboard](http://www.mygamercard.net/completionlb.php) where they
    rank you on your Gamerscore times your completion rate.

    that the prize you receive in from the [Xbox
    Rewards](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0205-xboxrewards.htm)
    program gets better if your Gamerscore is higher. With a meager 1090
    points, I’m in level 1. But those with 10,000+ or more can get a
    copy of [Fuzion Frenzy
    2](http://www.xbox.com/games/fuzionfrenzy2xbox360/) for completing
    the challenge.

    [complained](http://devhawk.net/2007/02/08/Morning+Coffee+27.aspx)
    that code in my RSS feed looks awful. It appears to be a problem
    with dasBlog. In validating the HTML is actually XHTML, it screws up
    the white space. Of course, usually that’s not a big deal, but
    inside a \<pre\> tag, it is. Until I get a chance to submit a patch
    to dasBlog to fix this, I’m using
    [CodeHTMLer](http://puzzleware.net/codehtmler/), which has a
    “convert white space” option that doesn’t use the \<pre\> tag at
    all. As a bonus, it even support PowerShell! Note, you have to use
    the [website](http://puzzleware.net/codehtmler/default.aspx), not
    their [WLWriter
    plugin](http://puzzleware.net/download.aspx?file=/codehtmler/codehtmler.livewriterplugin.zip),
    if you want the convert white space option.
-   There’s a new beta of
    [Ruby.NET](http://www.plas.fit.qut.edu.au/Ruby.NET/) available. Now
    that I’ve moved on to PowerShell, I’m only slightly interested in
    Ruby these days. If I can figure out how to create internal DSLs
    with PS, what would I need Ruby for? (via

-   [My old team](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/architecture) just shipped
    a single-instance multi-tenancy SaaS sample called
    [LitwareHR](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb229292).
    Details are on [Gianpaolo’s
    blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/gianpaolo/archive/2007/02/08/saas-sample-application-finally-here.aspx),
    code is up on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/litwarehr).
