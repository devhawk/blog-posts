Of course, TechEd is a big time for product announcements, new websites
(like [ARC](http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/)) and other assorted
new stuff. Here’s a roundup of stuff I’ve been tracking:

-   TechEd is the first time we’re talking about the new [Architect
    Certification](http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/certification)
    in earnest. There has been quite a bit of cabana traffic on this
    topic. People hear “certification” and think it’s a simple test, but
    when we explain that it’s more like a PhD board, they get more
    impressed. When they talk some of the people who have been through
    the beta program and they hear how hard it is, they are more
    impressed. So far, I think we’ve only passed around two thirds of
    the candidates even though the beta program consists entirely of
    hand selected partners and MSFT employees.
    [Mario](http://www.mariocardinal.com/) made a great analogy to 18th
    century medicine – certification helped the public separate the real
    doctors from the charlatans. There’s also a great [roundtable
    interview](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2005/jun05/06-06MSLearning.mspx)
    about the program up on PressPass. Joe from that interview spent a
    lot of time talking certification in the cabana yesterday. He
    mentioned that while there is some product focus, a deep Java
    architect should be able to pass the certification. Good news for
    Ted who [didn’t have many
    takers](http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20050605#1118010057986)
    to sign his book *Effective Enterprise Java* at the TechEd author
    signing on Sunday.
-   *patterns & practices* launched their new [dev center on
    MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/). They’ve also released
    previews of their new [Global Bank Integration Baseline
    Architecture](http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/gbi.asp)
    (typically just referred to as GBI) and the [WS-I Basic Security
    Profile Sample
    App](http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/MSWSIBSP.asp). I got
    a preview of the GBI project a few weeks ago, and I was very
    impressed (though it will be even more impressive if they release it
    as a GAT package). GBI has lots of moving parts that are headless,
    so the team wrote an application called The Narrator to help users
    explore what is happening in the system. It provides multiple views
    into the running system, including a system view, a services view, a
    pattern view and a security view. When I saw this, my first reaction
    was “Let’s get that on the web!” I mean, it’s great for use with the
    actual GBI, but GBI consists of 40 projects running across as many
    as six machines. That’s a lot of time investment to simple explore
    the system. So based on my suggestion, the p&p folks built a [flash
    demo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/narrator/narratorstart.html)
    of the GBI Narrator. Of course, the flash demo doesn’t connect to a
    running system, but it’s otherwise a very similar experience to the
    “real” narrator. [Let us know](mailto:hpiersonATmicrosoftDOTcom)what
    you think of this approach.
-   Lots of other people have linked to the new [VSTO
    Outlook](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=74b56c72-7a1f-431f-a29c-58eb39e97a86&displaylang=en)
    that SteveB announced on Monday, but I also wanted to link to [David
    Hill’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/dphill/). David is an architect
    from the Architecture Strategy team, but the VSTO team [“borrowed”
    him](http://blogs.msdn.com/dphill/archive/2005/06/06/425774.aspx)
    3-4 months ago to help make this happen. Watch David’s blog for info
    on what’s happening [under the
    covers](http://blogs.msdn.com/dphill/archive/2005/06/06/425786.aspx)
    with VSTO Outlook. Congrats David!
