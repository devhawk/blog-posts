I&#8217;m very impressed with IPv6. It really rectifies the issues around internet addressing beyond just providing a huge number of addresses (2<sup>125<\/sup> to be exact). In IPv6, interfaces typically have multiple addresses &#8211; an auto-configured link-local address, and a dynamically configured site-local and global address. IPv6 also provides a mechanism for neighbor discovery, which allows a node to determine what other devices (esp. routers) are on the local link. Many of these features are supported as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.upnp.org\/resources\/specifications.asp\">add-ons to IPv4<\/a>, but they aren&#8217;t very cleanly designed since they weren&#8217;t included in the original design. <\/p>\n<p>One funny thing about IPv6 &#8211; the first 13 bits of an IPv6 address is called the Top Level Aggregator Identifier, or the TLA ID. I thought TLA stood for Three Letter Acronym! <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>I did install the WinXP P2P SDK and poke around enough to notice it is C++ based.
