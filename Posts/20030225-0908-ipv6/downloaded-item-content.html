<p>Both <a href="http://www.threedegrees.com/">threedeegrees</a> and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=c3056f5a-f6ee-4147-b7c1-146064710f22&displaylang=en"> Windows XP Peer-to-Peer SDK</a> are now available. Haven&#8217;t tried them out yet (new baby) but I have been working through <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/4883.asp">Understanding IPv6</a> during off moments. I&#8217;m very impressed with IPv6. It really rectifies the issues around internet addressing beyond just providing a huge number of addresses (2<sup>125</sup> to be exact). In IPv6, interfaces typically have multiple addresses &#8211; an auto-configured link-local address, and a dynamically configured site-local and global address. IPv6 also provides a mechanism for neighbor discovery, which allows a node to determine what other devices (esp. routers) are on the local link. Many of these features are supported as <a href="http://www.upnp.org/resources/specifications.asp">add-ons to IPv4</a>, but they aren&#8217;t very cleanly designed since they weren&#8217;t included in the original design. </p>
<p>One funny thing about IPv6 &#8211; the first 13 bits of an IPv6 address is called the Top Level Aggregator Identifier, or the TLA ID. I thought TLA stood for Three Letter Acronym! <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"> </p>
<p>I did install the WinXP P2P SDK and poke around enough to notice it is C++ based. I wonder if the next version of the .NET Framework, with it&#8217;s built in IPv6 support, will get it&#8217;s own P2P SDK soon?</p>
