The last three weeks have been jam packed, starting with <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/events\/pdc\">PDC 05<\/a>, then a variety of meetings culminating with the company meeting the following week, then the <a href=\"http:\/\/mvp.support.microsoft.com\/MVPSMT2005\">2005 MVP Global Summit<\/a> last week. This was the first MVP Summit to include Architect MVPs so it was pretty stressful. Of course, there were things we could have done better, but all-in-all I was happy with the event. A year ago, we had just awarded our first 14 Architect MVPs. Now we&#8217;re 100 strong between our <a href=\"https:\/\/mvp.support.microsoft.com\/communities\/mvplist.aspx?Product=Visual+Developer+-+Solutions+Architect\">solution<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/mvp.support.microsoft.com\/communities\/mvplist.aspx?Product=Windows+Server+System+-+Infrastructure+Architect\">infrastructure<\/a> Architect MVPs and we had better than half of them in Redmond for the summit. I swear, it will take us the rest of the fiscal year to implement even half of their suggestions. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure each of the various groups that have MVPs think that their MVPs are the best, so I guess I&#8217;m no different in that regard. Our Architect MVPs are an amazing group and I am already looking forward to the next opportunity to get a bunch of them in a room together again.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe it October already.
