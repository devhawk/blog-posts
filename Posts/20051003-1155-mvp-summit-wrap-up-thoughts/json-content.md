It’s hard to believe it October already. The last three weeks have been
jam packed, starting with [PDC
05](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc), then a variety of meetings
culminating with the company meeting the following week, then the [2005
MVP Global Summit](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/MVPSMT2005) last
week. This was the first MVP Summit to include Architect MVPs so it was
pretty stressful. Of course, there were things we could have done
better, but all-in-all I was happy with the event. A year ago, we had
just awarded our first 14 Architect MVPs. Now we’re 100 strong between
our
[solution](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/communities/mvplist.aspx?Product=Visual+Developer+-+Solutions+Architect)
and
[infrastructure](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/communities/mvplist.aspx?Product=Windows+Server+System+-+Infrastructure+Architect)
Architect MVPs and we had better than half of them in Redmond for the
summit. I swear, it will take us the rest of the fiscal year to
implement even half of their suggestions.

I’m sure each of the various groups that have MVPs think that their MVPs
are the best, so I guess I’m no different in that regard. Our Architect
MVPs are an amazing group and I am already looking forward to the next
opportunity to get a bunch of them in a room together again.
