<p>It's hard to believe it October already. The last three weeks have been jam packed, starting with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc">PDC 05</a>, then a variety of meetings culminating with the company meeting the following week, then the <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/MVPSMT2005">2005 MVP Global Summit</a> last week. This was the first MVP Summit to include Architect MVPs so it was pretty stressful. Of course, there were things we could have done better, but all-in-all I was happy with the event. A year ago, we had just awarded our first 14 Architect MVPs. Now we're 100 strong between our <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/communities/mvplist.aspx?Product=Visual+Developer+-+Solutions+Architect">solution</a> and <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/communities/mvplist.aspx?Product=Windows+Server+System+-+Infrastructure+Architect">infrastructure</a> Architect MVPs and we had better than half of them in Redmond for the summit. I swear, it will take us the rest of the fiscal year to implement even half of their suggestions. </p><p>I'm sure each of the various groups that have MVPs think that their MVPs are the best, so I guess I'm no different in that regard. Our Architect MVPs are an amazing group and I am already looking forward to the next opportunity to get a bunch of them in a room together again.</p>
