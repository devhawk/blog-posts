<p>It took 30 hours of game play, spread out over a month and a half, but I finally finished <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/starwarskotorepublic/default.htm">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a>. It's easy to see why this game received so many <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/swkotor/awards.html">Game of the Year honors</a>, it's the best game I've ever played. And what's even cooler is that I want to play it again, this time as a bad guy. The whole light vs. dark side conflict works very well and I'm really curious to see how the game progresses when you're more Vader than Anakin. </p><p>I can't wait to see <a href="http://www.bioware.com/">Bioware's</a> next XBOX effort: <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/jadeempire">Jade Empire</a>. Between that and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/fable/default.htm">Fable</a>, this should be a good year for RPGs on XBOX. </p>
