  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[i played kotor the first time thru as a good guy and it was a blast.  i took a few months off, playing lesser games, and then came back to be the bad guy.

being the bad guy is tough. the gameplay is mostly the same as the light side.  the tough part is that you get the be REALLY bad.  not just "bad mood, snarky comments" bad, but "sell people into slavery" bad and "incite violence amongst peasants" bad.  it's great fun, and you feel guilty sometimes, choosing the bad choices, but when the little red icon pops up saying "you have gained dark side points," that makes it feel so good. ]]></wp:comment_content>
