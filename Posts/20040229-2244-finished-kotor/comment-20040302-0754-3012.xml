  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I haven't finished the game, yet.  It seems the drive on my XBox has gone bad.  I can't get past a certain spot in the game, it just freezes while trying to load the scene.  It also won't play DVDs all the way through.  Very frustrating.

However, when it was still working, I started another game of KOTOR where I chose all the "bad" paths.  It is much harder and you end up fighting a lot more.  Of course, I chose a fighter character this time.

Lots of fun.]]></wp:comment_content>
