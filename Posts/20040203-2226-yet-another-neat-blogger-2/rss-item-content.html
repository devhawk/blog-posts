<p>Say hello (and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/Rss.aspx">subscribe</a>) to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John deVadoss</a>, the latest .NEAT team member to start a blog. John's the Lead Solutions Architect for .NEAT, which means he's technical plus he manages people. He's got his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2004/02/03/66984.aspx">"Hello World" post</a> out of the way where he lists his interests. I spend a lot of time <strike>hounding</strike> talking with John, so I'm looking forward to his future posts. </p><p>I think my extended team (.NET Enterprise Architecture Team plus the Field Architect Evangelists) are really starting to get into this blogging thing. Besides John and myself, we've got David <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dphill/archive/2004/02/03/66916.aspx">explaining</a> "what makes a Smart Client so smart?", Ram on <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ramkoth/archive/2004/01/31/65321.aspx">SOA and OO</a>, Mike on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_platt/archive/2004/02/02/66099.aspx">modelling</a> and Simon on <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/smguest/category/2055.aspx">interop</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/smguest/archive/2004/01/18/60079.aspx">Outlook programmability</a>. Maybe I should start a .NEAT / AE blogroll? The blogrolls on my weblog are woefully out of date anyway, might be time for an overhaul.</p>
