Say hello (and [subscribe](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/Rss.aspx)) to
[John deVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/), the latest .NEAT team
member to start a blog. John’s the Lead Solutions Architect for .NEAT,
which means he’s technical plus he manages people. He’s got his [“Hello
World”
post](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2004/02/03/66984.aspx) out
of the way where he lists his interests. I spend a lot of time
~~hounding~~ talking with John, so I’m looking forward to his future
posts.

I think my extended team (.NET Enterprise Architecture Team plus the
Field Architect Evangelists) are really starting to get into this
blogging thing. Besides John and myself, we’ve got David

“what makes a Smart Client so smart?”, Ram on [SOA and
OO](http://weblogs.asp.net/ramkoth/archive/2004/01/31/65321.aspx), Mike
on
[modelling](http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_platt/archive/2004/02/02/66099.aspx)
and Simon on
[interop](http://weblogs.asp.net/smguest/category/2055.aspx) and
[Outlook
programmability](http://weblogs.asp.net/smguest/archive/2004/01/18/60079.aspx).
Maybe I should start a .NEAT / AE blogroll? The blogrolls on my weblog
are woefully out of date anyway, might be time for an overhaul.
