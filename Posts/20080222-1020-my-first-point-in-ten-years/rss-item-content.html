<p>Not only does this month mark <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!2065.entry">my son's fifth birthday</a>, it also marks the ten anniversary of my first date with my <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/default.aspx">awesome wife Julianne</a>. I met her online while I was laid up at home for six weeks after breaking my ankle at hockey practice. You see, I'm not just a hockey fan, but I also played several years of amateur league hockey in the mid-90's. I'm not very good, but I really love playing, though it all came to a halt when I broke my ankle.Â  </p><p>Last night, for the first time literally in a decade (shit, I'm getting old), I hit the ice for a <a href="http://groups.msn.com/TechRecHockeyLeague/home.msnw">local TechRec league game</a> ("Home of the Thundering Nerd Herd"). And when I say "hit the ice", I mean that fairly literally. Man, it's been a long time and I am WAY out of shape. I hurt pretty much all over, but especially my right shoulder.</p><p>We only had ten skaters, which means only two lines total. I probably skated around 20 minutes total - I spent three minutes in the penalty box (grabbed an opposing player as I fell down) and skipped the single power play we had. I still felt like I was gonna die by the end of the game. Hopefully, after I get a few more games under my belt, I'll be able to skate more than once up and down the ice without looking to the bench for a change. On the plus side, we won 6-2, I had an assist and was +1 on the night. </p><p>The TechRec league is very different from the league I played in down in SoCal. In SoCal, I played on the same team with the same players against the same players on the same other teams season after season. Naturally, animosity developed. In TechRec, they re-pick the teams every season, so it seems much more friendly and less competitive. I mean, we still want to win, but it takes on a different feel when you know some other player you don't like may be your teammate next season. </p><p>Major thanks to my neighbor Stephen Bury for getting me back on the ice. I'm looking forward to <strike>smashing him into the boards</strike><strike>grabbing him when I fall down</strike> facing off against his team a couple of weeks.</p>
