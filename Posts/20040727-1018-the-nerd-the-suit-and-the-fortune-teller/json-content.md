[Clemens](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6294c190-2ac0-40b8-ae83-3d79a81f7adc)
both blogged “The Nerd, the Suit and the Fortune Teller”, a hilarious
piece of theater performed at TechEd Amsterdam a few weeks ago.
[Clemens](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/) plays the nerd,
Rafal Lukawiecki the suit and [Pat
Helland](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland) the fortune teller. We’ve got
the video up on the web, you can access it from [Pat’s
site](http://pathelland.com/videos). Between this and [Mr. CIO
Guy](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=11950), sounds like
TechEd Amsterdam was a blast. Mental note: next year, make it to Europe
for TechEd!
