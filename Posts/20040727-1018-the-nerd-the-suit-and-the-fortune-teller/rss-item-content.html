We've got the video up on the web, you can access it from <a href="http://pathelland.com/videos">Pat's site</a>. Between this and <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=11950">Mr. CIO Guy</a>, sounds like TechEd Amsterdam was a blast. Mental note: next year, make it to Europe for TechEd! </p>
