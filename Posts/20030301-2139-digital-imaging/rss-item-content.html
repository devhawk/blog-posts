<p>As a new dad, I've got the requisite <a href="http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_product_lobbypage.asp?l=1&amp;p=16&amp;bc=2&amp;product=868"> digital camera</a> and <a href="http://www.canondv.com/archive/zr20/index.html"> digital camcorder</a>. So I've taken a ton of photos and shot some video, which I <a href="http://groups.msn.com/HarryPiersonPhotos/patrickharoldpierson.msnw"> share</a><a href="http://groups.msn.com/HarryPiersonPhotos/homemovies.msnw"> online</a>. But it's nice to have physical copies of the photos for albums, so I bought a new <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/un/WF05/18972-236251-236261-14438-71895.html"> HP 5550 DeskJet</a> printer. I also sprung for the high quality photo paper and the <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/un/WF08/18972-236251-236261-14438-71895.html#IDAY2CGB"> Photo InkJet Cartridge</a> that turns the 4 color printer into a 6 color photo printer. This printer was the <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,581924,00.asp">PC Magazine's Editor's Choice</a>, and after seeing the output, I completely agree. I used to do photo touchup and color correction for a publishing company, and this printer completely blows me away. </p><p>Now all I need is a DVD burner to go with my firewire card, 80GB hard drive and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/WindowsXP/moviemaker/default.asp">Windows Movie Maker</a>. </p>
