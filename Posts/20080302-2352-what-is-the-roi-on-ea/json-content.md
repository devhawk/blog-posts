Nick Malik [took me to
task](http://devhawk.net/2008/02/27/Morning+Coffee+150.aspx#2fa81c1e-6989-4f3d-a056-997a11964dbe)
for my
[suggestion](http://devhawk.net/2008/02/27/Morning+Coffee+150.aspx) that
Enterprise Architecture provides no value.

Nick also provided a link to an
[article](http://www.architectureandgovernance.com/articles/12-evolving_role.asp)
in Architecture and Governance magazine. I was going to read it, however
their web site is down as I write this. I feel comfortable interpreting
that as a sign that I’m right…

Actually, Nick’s got a point. It was wholly unfair of me to say that EA
provides no value. However, I do believe the return on investment of
enterprise architecture is fairly low, perhaps even negative. In other
words, I shouldn’t have argued that EA doesn’t deliver *any* value, but
instead that I don’t think it delivers *enough* value, given what we
spend on it.

Architecture ROI is hard enough to calculate on a project by project
basis. I would argue that measuring it at the EA level is probably
impossible, but I think that’s both a blessing and a curse. It’s a curse
because EA can’t justify their existence in terms the business can
understand. It’s a blessing because if EA is running as deep in the red
as I suspect they might be, the company would cut EA entirely in a
heartbeat.

Since Nick started my asking a question about value, let me turn it
around and ask some questions of my own:

1.  How much do you think your organization spends on EA per year?
2.  What do you think your organization’s EA ROI is?
3.  What can you do to improve your organization’s EA ROI?
