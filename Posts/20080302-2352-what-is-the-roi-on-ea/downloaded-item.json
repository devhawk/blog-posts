I can readily answer the question, from my viewpoint, but I chose instead to *ask* the question to see if my answer matches the various answers that I may hear back. I got a lot of valuable input, both on the blog and on the forum on Shared Insights where I asked the same question.<\/p>\n<p>You are the ONLY person to reply and say that EA provides no value. <\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you should read about the role and value of Enterprise Architecture from established sources before you bash the entire profession.<\/p>\n<p>EA is real, my friend. It is as real as city planning. The only major city in the US without city planning is Houston. I have visited a few times, and I can honestly say that without city planning, they are a mess. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Nick also provided a link to an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.architectureandgovernance.com\/articles\/12-evolving_role.asp\">article<\/a> in Architecture and Governance magazine. I was going to read it, however their web site is down as I write this. I feel comfortable interpreting that as a sign that I&#8217;m right&#8230; <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1113\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>Actually, Nick&#8217;s got a point. It was wholly unfair of me to say that EA provides no value. However, I do believe the return on investment of enterprise architecture is fairly low, perhaps even negative. In other words, I shouldn&#8217;t have argued that EA doesn&#8217;t deliver <em>any <\/em>value, but instead that I don&#8217;t think it delivers <em>enough <\/em>value, given what we spend on it.<\/p>\n<p>Architecture ROI is hard enough to calculate on a project by project basis. I would argue that measuring it at the EA level is probably impossible, but I think that&#8217;s both a blessing and a curse. It&#8217;s a curse because EA can&#8217;t justify their existence in terms the business can understand. It&#8217;s a blessing because if EA is running as deep in the red as I suspect they might be, the company would cut EA entirely in a heartbeat. <\/p>\n<p>Since Nick started my asking a question about value, let me turn it around and ask some questions of my own:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>How much do you think your organization spends on EA per year? <\/li>\n<li>What do you think your organization&#8217;s EA ROI is? <\/li>\n<li>What can you do to improve your organization&#8217;s EA ROI?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","excerpt":"<p>Nick Malik took me to task for my suggestion that Enterprise Architecture provides no value.
