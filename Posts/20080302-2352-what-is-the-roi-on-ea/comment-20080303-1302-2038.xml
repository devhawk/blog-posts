  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It would be good if you demonstrated you understood EA before you criticized it. It would also be good if you differentiated the way EA is practiced from what EA is -- two different things. I certainly hope you're not just another blogger mouthing off about stuff they know nothing about. So many times we see something like DBAs mucking up most development efforts and jump to the conlusion that data modeling is bogus, or something just as stupid. 

I tried to discuss modeling in general just today -- you might find my post interesting. Maybe not. I only teach this stuff. What do I know?
