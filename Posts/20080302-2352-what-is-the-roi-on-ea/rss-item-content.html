<p>Nick Malik <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/02/27/Morning+Coffee+150.aspx#2fa81c1e-6989-4f3d-a056-997a11964dbe">took me to task</a> for my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/02/27/Morning+Coffee+150.aspx">suggestion</a> that Enterprise Architecture provides no value.</p><blockquote><p>You implied that I could not answer the question, "How does EA demonstrate value." That is not true. I can readily answer the question, from my viewpoint, but I chose instead to *ask* the question to see if my answer matches the various answers that I may hear back. I got a lot of valuable input, both on the blog and on the forum on Shared Insights where I asked the same question.</p><p>You are the ONLY person to reply and say that EA provides no value. </p><p>Perhaps you should read about the role and value of Enterprise Architecture from established sources before you bash the entire profession.</p><p>EA is real, my friend. It is as real as city planning. The only major city in the US without city planning is Houston. I have visited a few times, and I can honestly say that without city planning, they are a mess. </p></blockquote><p>Nick also provided a link to an <a href="http://www.architectureandgovernance.com/articles/12-evolving_role.asp">article</a> in Architecture and Governance magazine. I was going to read it, however their web site is down as I write this. I feel comfortable interpreting that as a sign that I'm right... :)</p><p>Actually, Nick's got a point. It was wholly unfair of me to say that EA provides no value. However, I do believe the return on investment of enterprise architecture is fairly low, perhaps even negative. In other words, I shouldn't have argued that EA doesn't deliver <em>any </em>value, but instead that I don't think it delivers <em>enough </em>value, given what we spend on it.</p><p>Architecture ROI is hard enough to calculate on a project by project basis. I would argue that measuring it at the EA level is probably impossible, but I think that's both a blessing and a curse. It's a curse because EA can't justify their existence in terms the business can understand. It's a blessing because if EA is running as deep in the red as I suspect they might be, the company would cut EA entirely in a heartbeat. </p><p>Since Nick started my asking a question about value, let me turn it around and ask some questions of my own:</p><ol><li>How much do you think your organization spends on EA per year? </li><li>What do you think your organization's EA ROI is? </li><li>What can you do to improve your organization's EA ROI?</li></ol>
