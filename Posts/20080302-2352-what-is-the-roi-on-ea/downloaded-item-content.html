<p>Nick Malik <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/02/27/Morning+Coffee+150.aspx#2fa81c1e-6989-4f3d-a056-997a11964dbe">took me to task</a> for my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/02/27/Morning+Coffee+150.aspx">suggestion</a> that Enterprise Architecture provides no value.</p>
<blockquote><p>You implied that I could not answer the question, &#8220;How does EA demonstrate value.&#8221; That is not true. I can readily answer the question, from my viewpoint, but I chose instead to *ask* the question to see if my answer matches the various answers that I may hear back. I got a lot of valuable input, both on the blog and on the forum on Shared Insights where I asked the same question.</p>
<p>You are the ONLY person to reply and say that EA provides no value. </p>
<p>Perhaps you should read about the role and value of Enterprise Architecture from established sources before you bash the entire profession.</p>
<p>EA is real, my friend. It is as real as city planning. The only major city in the US without city planning is Houston. I have visited a few times, and I can honestly say that without city planning, they are a mess. </p>

<p>Nick also provided a link to an <a href="http://www.architectureandgovernance.com/articles/12-evolving_role.asp">article</a> in Architecture and Governance magazine. I was going to read it, however their web site is down as I write this. I feel comfortable interpreting that as a sign that I&#8217;m right&#8230; <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group1113" alt=":)"> </p>
<p>Actually, Nick&#8217;s got a point. It was wholly unfair of me to say that EA provides no value. However, I do believe the return on investment of enterprise architecture is fairly low, perhaps even negative. In other words, I shouldn&#8217;t have argued that EA doesn&#8217;t deliver <em>any </em>value, but instead that I don&#8217;t think it delivers <em>enough </em>value, given what we spend on it.</p>
<p>Architecture ROI is hard enough to calculate on a project by project basis. I would argue that measuring it at the EA level is probably impossible, but I think that&#8217;s both a blessing and a curse. It&#8217;s a curse because EA can&#8217;t justify their existence in terms the business can understand. It&#8217;s a blessing because if EA is running as deep in the red as I suspect they might be, the company would cut EA entirely in a heartbeat. </p>
<p>Since Nick started my asking a question about value, let me turn it around and ask some questions of my own:</p>
<ol>
<li>How much do you think your organization spends on EA per year? </li>
<li>What do you think your organization&#8217;s EA ROI is? </li>
<li>What can you do to improve your organization&#8217;s EA ROI?</li>
</ol>
