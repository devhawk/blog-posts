<p>When I blogged TechEd, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=40a26f60-2238-405d-98fc-19898299f031">started</a> on Day Zero, the day before TechEd officially opened.&nbsp;At TechEd, that day is used for preconfernce sessions as well as other meetings. At OOPSLA, there are two days of preconfernces &#8211; I arrived today but the conference doesn&#8217;t officially open until Tuesday with <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=801">Rick Rashid&#8217;s keynote</a>. I guess that makes today &#8220;-1&#8243;. So far, it&#8217;s very quiet around here. I&#8217;ve got booth duty until 5pm, but I doubt I&#8217;ll spend much time with attendees. There&#8217;s only about 15 attendees in the exhibit hall right now. All the booth staff are chit-chatting with each other or are working on their computers. I&#8217;m sitting with Ajay, a product manager from VSTS emailing, chatting and deailing with some last minute shipping issues. (My group has just had really bad luck sending stuff recently). Of course, I&#8217;m guessing most people are in their precon sessions. I stuck my head in Jack&#8217;s session on <a href="http://www.program-transformation.org/Gpce/TutorialGP3">Generative Software Development</a> and it was full. Tomorrow is the <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=141">DSL Tutorial</a> that Keith <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2004/10/16/243389.aspx">blogged about</a>. By then, I&#8217;m thinking things will be in full swing.</p>
