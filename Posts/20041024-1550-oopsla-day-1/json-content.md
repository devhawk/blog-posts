When I blogged TechEd, I
[started](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=40a26f60-2238-405d-98fc-19898299f031)
on Day Zero, the day before TechEd officially opened. At TechEd, that
day is used for preconfernce sessions as well as other meetings. At
OOPSLA, there are two days of preconfernces – I arrived today but the
conference doesn’t officially open until Tuesday with [Rick Rashid’s
keynote](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=801). I guess that
makes today “-1″. So far, it’s very quiet around here. I’ve got booth
duty until 5pm, but I doubt I’ll spend much time with attendees. There’s
only about 15 attendees in the exhibit hall right now. All the booth
staff are chit-chatting with each other or are working on their
computers. I’m sitting with Ajay, a product manager from VSTS emailing,
chatting and deailing with some last minute shipping issues. (My group
has just had really bad luck sending stuff recently). Of course, I’m
guessing most people are in their precon sessions. I stuck my head in
Jack’s session on [Generative Software
Development](http://www.program-transformation.org/Gpce/TutorialGP3) and
it was full. Tomorrow is the [DSL
Tutorial](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=141) that Keith
[blogged
about](http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2004/10/16/243389.aspx).
By then, I’m thinking things will be in full swing.
