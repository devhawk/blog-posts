In experimenting with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/NWSGI">NWSGI</a> yesterday, I found I wanted the ability to launch the development web server that ships with Visual Studio (WebDev.WebServer.exe) from the command line. I hacked up the following PowerShell function and dropped it into my $profile so I can easily launch the web server in any directory any time I need. Thought I'd share:
<pre class="brush: powershell">function webdev($path,$port=8080,$vpath='/')   
{   
    $spath = 'C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\DevServer9.0\WebDev.WebServer.EXE'
    $rpath = resolve-path $path  
    $params = "/path:`"$rpath`" /port:$port /vpath:$vpath"  

    $ignore = [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($spath, $params)  
    "Started WebDev Server for '$path' directory on port $port"  
}</pre>
There's probably an easier way to launch an exe with parameters than Sys.Diags.Process.Start, but it works. Using resolve-path is the key, that lets me pass in a relative path on the command line, but the script converts it to an absolute path in order to pass it to the webdev server. Also, I'm not sure I should have hard coded the path to the exe, but again it works and it's not like it's tough to change.

Enjoy.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update</span></strong>: Tomas Restrepo pointed out an easier way to start the process:
<pre class="brush: powershell">&amp;'C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\DevServer9.0\WebDev.WebServer.EXE' "/path:$rpath" "/port:$port" "/vpath:$vpath"</pre>
I couldn't figure out how to correctly launch the exe when the physical path to serve has a space in it. Thanks Tomas.
