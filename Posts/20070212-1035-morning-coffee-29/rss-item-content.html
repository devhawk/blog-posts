<ul><li>My friends at Manning sent me a copy of <a href="http://www.manning.com/payette/">Windows PowerShell in Action</a>. If you're at all interested in PS, buy this book as soon as it comes out.</li><li>My colleague in MSIT Nick Malik wants to know the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/02/11/what-are-the-top-100-patterns-that-every-developer-must-know.aspx">top 100 patterns every developer must know</a>. I'd start with the ones from Fowler's <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/books.html#eaa">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>.</li><li>Jeff Atwood figures out how to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000790.html">wake up his computer from across the room</a>. Money quote: "why get out of your chair and walk 20 feet when you can spend two hours figuring out how to do it without moving at all?"</li><li>Tomas Restrepo says that WCF is <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/02/12/WCFConfigurationComplexity.aspx">too configurable</a>. But he doesn't really mean it because later he says that while it's "fantastic" that WCF has so many options to tweak, he wished those options were less "in my face". I've reached a <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/05/Morning+Coffee+4.aspx">similar conclusion</a>, so I'm with you 100% Tomas. </li><li>Scott explains how to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToRotateAnAVIOrMPEGFileTakenInPortrait.aspx">rotate a video file</a>. I have a whole collection of video clips taken with my wife's digital camera where I shot portrait by mistake, so this is good to know.</li></ul>
