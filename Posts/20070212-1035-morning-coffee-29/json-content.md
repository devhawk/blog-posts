-   My friends at Manning sent me a copy of [Windows PowerShell in
    Action](http://www.manning.com/payette/). If you’re at all
    interested in PS, buy this book as soon as it comes out.
-   My colleague in MSIT Nick Malik wants to know the [top 100 patterns
    every developer must
    know](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/02/11/what-are-the-top-100-patterns-that-every-developer-must-know.aspx).
    I’d start with the ones from Fowler’s [Patterns of Enterprise
    Application
    Architecture](http://www.martinfowler.com/books.html#eaa).
-   Jeff Atwood figures out how to [wake up his computer from across the
    room](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000790.html). Money
    quote: “why get out of your chair and walk 20 feet when you can
    spend two hours figuring out how to do it without moving at all?”
-   Tomas Restrepo says that WCF is [too
    configurable](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/02/12/WCFConfigurationComplexity.aspx). But
    he doesn’t really mean it because later he says that while it’s
    “fantastic” that WCF has so many options to tweak, he wished those
    options were less “in my face”. I’ve reached a [similar
    conclusion](http://devhawk.net/2007/01/05/morning-coffee-4/), so
    I’m with you 100% Tomas.
-   Scott explains how to [rotate a video
    file](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToRotateAnAVIOrMPEGFileTakenInPortrait.aspx).
    I have a whole collection of video clips taken with my wife’s
    digital camera where I shot portrait by mistake, so this is good to
    know.
