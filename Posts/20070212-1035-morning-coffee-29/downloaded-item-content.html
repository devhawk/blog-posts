<li>My friends at Manning sent me a copy of <a href="http://www.manning.com/payette/">Windows PowerShell in Action</a>. If you&#8217;re at all interested in PS, buy this book as soon as it comes out.</li>
<li>My colleague in MSIT Nick Malik wants to know the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/02/11/what-are-the-top-100-patterns-that-every-developer-must-know.aspx">top 100 patterns every developer must know</a>. I&#8217;d start with the ones from Fowler&#8217;s <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/books.html#eaa">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>.</li>
<li>Jeff Atwood figures out how to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000790.html">wake up his computer from across the room</a>. Money quote: &#8220;why get out of your chair and walk 20 feet when you can spend two hours figuring out how to do it without moving at all?&#8221;</li>
<li>Tomas Restrepo says that WCF is <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/02/12/WCFConfigurationComplexity.aspx">too configurable</a>.&nbsp;But he doesn&#8217;t really mean it because later he says that while it&#8217;s &#8220;fantastic&#8221; that WCF has so many options to tweak, he wished&nbsp;those options were less &#8220;in my face&#8221;.&nbsp;I&#8217;ve reached a <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/05/Morning+Coffee+4.aspx">similar conclusion</a>, so I&#8217;m with you 100% Tomas. </li>
<li>Scott explains how to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToRotateAnAVIOrMPEGFileTakenInPortrait.aspx">rotate a video file</a>. I have a whole collection of video clips taken with my wife&#8217;s digital camera where I shot portrait by mistake, so this is good to know.</li>
