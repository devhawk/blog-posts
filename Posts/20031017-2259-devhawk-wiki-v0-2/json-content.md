I havenâ€™t updated the [project page](prj_wiki.aspx) on this site, but I
have [updated the
code](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/FileShare.aspx?id=9513f6ed-41c2-4c0f-a5d6-730371bb4b45)
and [created a new
release](http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/viewuploads.aspx?id=9513f6ed-41c2-4c0f-a5d6-730371bb4b45)
on the [DevHawk Wiki GDN
Workspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=9513f6ed-41c2-4c0f-a5d6-730371bb4b45).
New features include:

-   Support for multiple wiki page versions in SampleWiki. Now, when you
    update a page, the old one is copied to an archive directory rather
    than overwritten. Also able to view version history by page.
-   Support for Header tags in WikiRenderer (! to start a line == h1, !!
    == h2, etc)
-   Removed support for local:// tags in WikiRenderer (not sure what I
    was thinking on this one)
