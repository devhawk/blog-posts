<p>Someone from the P2P team internally saw my blog and set me a list of commands to execute and send back to him to help troubleshoot my problem. One of those commands was &#8220;net start pnrpsvc&#8221;. Aha! I hadn&#8217;t realized that the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/list/winxppeer.asp">WinXP Adv. Networking Pack</a> installed any services. Turns out it installs four, including the &#8220;Peer Name Resolution Protocol&#8221; service (i.e. pnrpsvc). What&#8217;s odd is that now that I&#8217;ve started it manually once, it seems to autostart on demand now. I can resolve addresses, as well as <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=5410b65a-7609-4e56-ac6f-c16ab6e19a24">ping the seed server</a>. GraphChat doesn&#8217;t work yet, but I think that&#8217;s because the IPv6 firewall only has two ports open by default &#8211; PNRP (UDP 3540) and Grouping (TCP 3587). The GraphChat sample uses a dynamically chosen port, which would be blocked. </p>
<p>So now that I&#8217;m back on track, I&#8217;ve got the PNRP namespace provider API wrapped in Managed C++. I can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/p2psdk/p2p/registering_a_peer_name.asp">register</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/p2psdk/p2p/unregistering_a_peer_name.asp">unregister</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/p2psdk/p2p/resolving_a_peer_name.asp">resolve</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/p2psdk/p2p/enumerating_clouds.asp">enumerate PNRP clouds</a> from managed code. I&#8217;ve also got a first pass of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/p2psdk/p2p/identity_manager_api.asp">Identity Manager API</a> and a skeleton of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/p2psdk/p2p/graphing_api.asp">Graphing API</a> done. I&#8217;ll post code when I have a managed GraphChat sample working.</p>
