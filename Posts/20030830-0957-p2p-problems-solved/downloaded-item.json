One of those commands was &#8220;net start pnrpsvc&#8221;. Aha! I hadn&#8217;t realized that the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/downloads\/list\/winxppeer.asp\">WinXP Adv. Networking Pack<\/a> installed any services. Turns out it installs four, including the &#8220;Peer Name Resolution Protocol&#8221; service (i.e. pnrpsvc). What&#8217;s odd is that now that I&#8217;ve started it manually once, it seems to autostart on demand now. I can resolve addresses, as well as <a href=\"PermaLink.aspx?guid=5410b65a-7609-4e56-ac6f-c16ab6e19a24\">ping the seed server<\/a>. GraphChat doesn&#8217;t work yet, but I think that&#8217;s because the IPv6 firewall only has two ports open by default &#8211; PNRP (UDP 3540) and Grouping (TCP 3587). The GraphChat sample uses a dynamically chosen port, which would be blocked. <\/p>\n<p>So now that I&#8217;m back on track, I&#8217;ve got the PNRP namespace provider API wrapped in Managed C++. I can <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/p2psdk\/p2p\/registering_a_peer_name.asp\">register<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/p2psdk\/p2p\/unregistering_a_peer_name.asp\">unregister<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/p2psdk\/p2p\/resolving_a_peer_name.asp\">resolve<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/p2psdk\/p2p\/enumerating_clouds.asp\">enumerate PNRP clouds<\/a> from managed code. I&#8217;ve also got a first pass of the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/p2psdk\/p2p\/identity_manager_api.asp\">Identity Manager API<\/a> and a skeleton of the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/p2psdk\/p2p\/graphing_api.asp\">Graphing API<\/a> done. I&#8217;ll post code when I have a managed GraphChat sample working.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Someone from the P2P team internally saw my blog and set me a list of commands to execute and send back to him to help troubleshoot my problem.
