I’ve had a chance to email back and forth with [Mary Jo
Foley](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/author_bio/0,4308,a=2274,00.asp)
regarding being quoted in
[Microsoft-Watch](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/) newsletter. She sent
me a copy of last week’s article where she links to Don’s opinion of
InfoPath and directly quotes
[Clemens](http://radio.weblogs.com/0108971/2003/03/06.html#a121). So my
comment about only quoting the guy with something negative to say was
wrong, and thus I retract it and apologize. There was also some
confusion regarding my opinion of InfoPath as a front-end blogging tool.
I was
[commenting](PermaLink.aspx?guid=dfc79478-f78f-4c4c-b105-02efd3d5a058)
on InfoPath’s suitability (or lack thereof) as a general development
tool, not as a weblog front end. I think that InfoPath would rock as a
front-end blog tool – I’m just frustrated by the current lack of
documentation.

BTW, Scoble had this to say:

I wanted to point out that while “main-stream press folks rarely link”,
the same can’t be said of Mary Jo. The newsletter includes links to all
of the relevant blog entries. They’re using a redirect server so the
links in the newsletter are routed though them, but the user ends up on
the blog entry in question. Also, Microsoft-Watch has an [RSS
feed](http://rssnewsapps.ziffdavis.com/msw.xml), which I’ve now
subscribed to.

Robert, are you going to add “Let’s be careful out there” to your
manifesto? I’ll hum the theme to Hill Street Blues…
