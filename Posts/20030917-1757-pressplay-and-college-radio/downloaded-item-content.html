<p>I just signed up for the <a href="http://www.pressplay.com">PressPlay</a> free trial. I&#8217;m on the road and just needed some tunes. I guess I should also try some of the other the services, but so far I&#8217;m very impressed. Only a couple of annoyances: the whole &#8220;<a href="http://www.pressplay.com/faq.html#general_05">Portable Download</a>&#8221; concept is way more complicated &amp; pricey than it needs to be. Everyone else just charges 99&#162; a song (or less). What&#8217;s with the buying &#8220;packs&#8221; of portable downloads? And, of course,  their music collection could be bigger &#8211; no AC/DC :(. But lots of stuff that I haven&#8217;t listened to since I was a DJ for my <a href="http://www.kscrradio.com/"> college radio station</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of college radio, writing this post inspired me to google my old radio station KSCR. I guess it never occurred to me before now, but of course they are streaming over the Internet. Currently playing: <a href="http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?song=1194111&album=117846">World&#8217;s On Heroin</a> by <a href="http://entertainment.msn.com/artist/?artist=112951"> All</a>. Never heard it before, but I like it. Current show on KSCR is <i>Yay For Punk</i><span class="schedule-preview-details">with Naitze &#8220;DJ Naitze Naitz&#8221; Teng &amp; Kate Wilcox. Their on-air sound needs work and apparently the issues of DJ&#8217;s arriving on time still hasn&#8217;t been solved.</span></p>
