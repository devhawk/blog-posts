<p>I just signed up for the <a href="http://www.pressplay.com">PressPlay</a> free trial. I'm on the road and just needed some tunes. I guess I should also try some of the other the services, but so far I'm very impressed. Only a couple of annoyances: the whole "<a href="http://www.pressplay.com/faq.html#general_05">Portable Download</a>" concept is way more complicated &amp; pricey than it needs to be. Everyone else just charges 99¢ a song (or less). What's with the buying "packs" of portable downloads? And, of course,  their music collection could be bigger - no AC/DC :(. But lots of stuff that I haven't listened to since I was a DJ for my <a href="http://www.kscrradio.com/"> college radio station</a>.</p><p>Speaking of college radio, writing this post inspired me to google my old radio station KSCR. I guess it never occurred to me before now, but of course they are streaming over the Internet. Currently playing: <a href="http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?song=1194111&amp;album=117846">World's On Heroin</a> by <a href="http://entertainment.msn.com/artist/?artist=112951"> All</a>. Never heard it before, but I like it. Current show on KSCR is <i>Yay For Punk</i><span class="schedule-preview-details">with Naitze "DJ Naitze Naitz" Teng &amp; Kate Wilcox. Their on-air sound needs work and apparently the issues of DJ's arriving on time still hasn't been solved.</span></p>
