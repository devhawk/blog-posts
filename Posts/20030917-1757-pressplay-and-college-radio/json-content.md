I just signed up for the [PressPlay](http://www.pressplay.com) free
trial. I’m on the road and just needed some tunes. I guess I should also
try some of the other the services, but so far I’m very impressed. Only
a couple of annoyances: the whole “[Portable
Download](http://www.pressplay.com/faq.html#general_05)” concept is way
more complicated & pricey than it needs to be. Everyone else just
charges 99¢ a song (or less). What’s with the buying “packs” of portable
downloads? And, of course, their music collection could be bigger – no
AC/DC :(. But lots of stuff that I haven’t listened to since I was a DJ
for my [college radio station](http://www.kscrradio.com/).

Speaking of college radio, writing this post inspired me to google my
old radio station KSCR. I guess it never occurred to me before now, but
of course they are streaming over the Internet. Currently playing:
[World’s On
Heroin](http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?song=1194111&album=117846)
by [All](http://entertainment.msn.com/artist/?artist=112951). Never
heard it before, but I like it. Current show on KSCR is *Yay For
Punk*<span class="schedule-preview-details">with Naitze “DJ Naitze
Naitz” Teng & Kate Wilcox. Their on-air sound needs work and apparently
the issues of DJ’s arriving on time still hasn’t been solved.</span>
