It’s been about 11 months since the last [Lang.NET
Symposium](http://www.langnetsymposium.com/) and we’ve been working on
next year’s version. But then we discovered that we’re not the only ones
inside Microsoft thinking about having [a language
conference](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2201).
A couple of meetings later, and we’ve decided to combine them, which
will assuredly lead to side conversations like this:

> DSL DevCon Attendee: Hey, you got your compiler in my DSL!
>
> Lang.NET Attendee: Hey, you got your DSL in my compiler!
>
> [They sample the combined content]
>
> Both Attendees: Mmmm, two great conferences that work well together!

Well, maybe not. But seriously, it should be a great combined
conference.

However, there are some logistics things we need to work out, like how
many days should the combined conference run? We figure the “right”
answer to these questions depends on the likely overlap between the two
conferences. Frankly, we don’t know what the overlap will be so we
decided to [simply, you know,
ask](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2219).

If you are interested in attending Lang.NET, the DSL DevCon, or both
next year, please head over to Chris Sells blog and [make your voice
heard](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2219).
