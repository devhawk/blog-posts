<p>It’s been about 11 months since the last <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/">Lang.NET Symposium</a> and we’ve been working on next year’s version. But then we discovered that we’re not the only ones inside Microsoft thinking about having <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2201">a language conference</a>. A couple of meetings later, and we’ve decided to combine them, which will assuredly lead to side conversations like this:</p><blockquote><p>DSL DevCon Attendee: Hey, you got your compiler in my DSL!</p><p>Lang.NET Attendee: Hey, you got your DSL in my compiler!</p><p>[They sample the combined content]</p><p>Both Attendees: Mmmm, two great conferences that work well together!</p></blockquote><p>Well, maybe not. But seriously, it should be a great combined conference.</p><p>However, there are some logistics things we need to work out, like how many days should the combined conference run? We figure the “right” answer to these questions depends on the likely overlap between the two conferences. Frankly, we don’t know what the overlap will be so we decided to <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2219">simply, you know, ask</a>.</p><p>If you are interested in attending Lang.NET, the DSL DevCon, or both next year, <u>please</u> head over to Chris Sells blog and <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2219">make your voice heard</a>. </p>
