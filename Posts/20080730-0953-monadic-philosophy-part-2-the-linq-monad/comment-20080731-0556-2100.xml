  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Don't fall into the newbie trap of thinking that monads are about sequencing operations.  They aren't.  A large number of monads (for example, Reader) are commutative and do not enforce any sort of statement ordering.

It seems most people are first introduced to the notion of monads when attempting to do purely functional IO or stateful computations, which is too bad.  Not only are these monads extremely complex (causing the beginner to think monads are more complex in general than they really are) but they are also not representatitive.

I think the Maybe monad and List monad are better "first monads" than State or IO.]]></wp:comment_content>
