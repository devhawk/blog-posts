Among other things, she showed off <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webcollab.com\/alee\/papers\/infovis02.htm\">eTree<\/a>: &#8220;A Browse and Query Interface for Online Communities&#8221;. Basically, its a tool for visualizing the activity of a web discussion forum (such as the <a href=\"http:\/\/asp.net\/forums\">ASP.NET Forums<\/a>). In this idiom, each branch of the tree is a forum and each leaf on the tree is a thread. &#8220;Hot&#8221; threads become flowers on the branch. Older posts are dark green while newer posts are lighter. Members of the community are rendered as circles around the outside of the tree &#8211; selecting a user highlights the threads they have participated in.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s really exciting is that researchers are starting to look at blogging. I know lots of people were interested in the Wallop project from the MS Research <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/scg\/\">Social Computing Group<\/a> that was highlighted @ PDC. I want to see this technology make it into blogger tools.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>My friend Matt blogged ReMail, a research prototype email client from the IBM Watson Research Center.
