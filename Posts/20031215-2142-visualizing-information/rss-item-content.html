<p>My friend <a href="http://technovangelist.com/">Matt</a> blogged <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/remail/index.html">ReMail</a>, a research prototype email client from the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/cambridge">IBM Watson Research Center</a>. Matt's right that many of these features of ReMail are already in Outlook 2003 (List Seperators, Annotations, Threads, Collections). But what makes ReMail really cool is their <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/remail/visualizations.html">visualizations</a>. "The visualizations in Remail were designed to help people see connections between messages and people that would otherwise be invisible." I'm going to need to read more about <a href="http://domino.watson.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/1e4115aea78b6e7c85256b360066f0d4/7a30ed0aac59bf5d85256d79006f272f?OpenDocument">Thread Arcs</a>. </p><p>This cool visualization reminds me of a research talk I got to see by <a href="http://www.webcollab.com/alee/">Alison Lee</a> from IBM Watson Research on campus a couple of weeks ago. Among other things, she showed off <a href="http://www.webcollab.com/alee/papers/infovis02.htm">eTree</a>: "A Browse and Query Interface for Online Communities". Basically, its a tool for visualizing the activity of a web discussion forum (such as the <a href="http://asp.net/forums">ASP.NET Forums</a>). In this idiom, each branch of the tree is a forum and each leaf on the tree is a thread. "Hot" threads become flowers on the branch. Older posts are dark green while newer posts are lighter. Members of the community are rendered as circles around the outside of the tree - selecting a user highlights the threads they have participated in.</p><p>What's really exciting is that researchers are starting to look at blogging. I know lots of people were interested in the Wallop project from the MS Research <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/scg/">Social Computing Group</a> that was highlighted @ PDC. I want to see this technology make it into blogger tools.</p>
