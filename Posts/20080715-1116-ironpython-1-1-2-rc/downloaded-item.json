We return a boxed 32-bit integer for Ops.Id(), unless you&#8217;ve allocated over 2^32 objects in which case we roll over to our arbitrary precision IronMath.BigInteger type. Note, this only would affect statically typed languages compiled against the IronPython assembly. It wouldn&#8217;t affect python\u00a0 code in any way.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We think these are fairly minor (hence the reason we green-lit them) and furthermore these changes mirrors the eventual behavior of 2.0. Please let me know if either of the changes is a problem for you or your project. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>It&#8217;s a little late, but we just pushed out the RC for IronPython 1.1.2.
