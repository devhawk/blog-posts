<p>It&#8217;s a little late, but we just pushed out the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython&ReleaseId=15198">RC for IronPython 1.1.2</a>. This is a minor release with a bunch of bug fixes we&#8217;ve backported from our 2.0 work. </p>
<p>However, there are two minor breaking changes I wanted to highlight:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work Item <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=16348">#16348</a> &#8211; We&#8217;ve changed the nt.unlink method so that it raises an exception if the file doesn&#8217;t exist. This brings nt.unlink in line with CPython&#8217;s behavior, but does change the public behavior of the method.  </li>
<li>Work Item <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=16735">#16735</a> &#8211; We&#8217;ve changed the return type of IronPython.Runtime.Operations.Ops.Id() from long to object. We return a boxed 32-bit integer for Ops.Id(), unless you&#8217;ve allocated over 2^32 objects in which case we roll over to our arbitrary precision IronMath.BigInteger type. Note, this only would affect statically typed languages compiled against the IronPython assembly. It wouldn&#8217;t affect python&nbsp; code in any way.</li>
</ol>
<p>We think these are fairly minor (hence the reason we green-lit them) and furthermore these changes mirrors the eventual behavior of 2.0. Please let me know if either of the changes is a problem for you or your project. </p>
