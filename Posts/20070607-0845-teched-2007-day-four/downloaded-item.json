Got into a long conversation with <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/garethj\">Gareth Jones<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.peterprovost.org\/\">Peter Provost<\/a> about combining test-driven and model-driven development. Having done evangelism for five of the last six years, I haven&#8217;t been an agile practitioner. I&#8217;m getting to the point where I feel dirty when I don&#8217;t write tests or don&#8217;t check in, but\u00a0not dirty enough to actually do anything about it (yet). But practicing or not, it was\u00a0fascinating to hear Gareth and Peter\u00a0brainstorm on this topic. <\/p>\n<p>Speaking of\u00a0storms,\u00a0we had a downpour here yesterday. Thunderstorm moved right over the convention center &#8211; you could tell by how loud the thunder and rain were. I hit a seam in the storm heading back to my hotel, but I did get drenched heading to the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/trika\/archive\/2007\/05\/01\/mcp-posse-rolls-deep-influencer-party-at-teched.aspx\">influencer party<\/a> @ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.margaritavilleorlando.com\/\">Margaritaville<\/a>. The party was fun, after I dried off, though I seem to remember knowing more of the influencers last time I was @ TechEd. Ended up sharing a cab back to the hotel with <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/\">Ted Neward<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doitwith.net\/\">Mark Miller<\/a>. Ted&#8217;s like the\u00a0IT Industry&#8217;s Switzerland, so\u00a0I took the opportunity to pick his\u00a0brain on the goings on in other communities &#8211; primarily the Ruby community.<\/p>\n<p>I did get a chance to hack a little code yesterday.\u00a0As a side effect of my interest in programming language design, I&#8217;m also interested in <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/Modular+Compilers.aspx\">parser development<\/a>. Towards that end, I&#8217;ve been learning about <a href=\"http:\/\/pdos.csail.mit.edu\/~baford\/packrat\/\">Parsing Expression Grammars<\/a>. The <a href=\"http:\/\/pdos.csail.mit.edu\/~baford\/packrat\/thesis\/\">original PEG parser<\/a> was built in Haskell, but I decided to write mine in F#. Even though I had never worked in F# before, I got my parser up and running fairly easily the first time. I did hit one syntax snag that <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dsyme\">Don Syme<\/a>\u00a0helped me with. I&#8217;ll blog this more in detail later, but I ported a <a href=\"http:\/\/pdos.csail.mit.edu\/~baford\/packrat\/icfp02\/ArithPackrat.hs\">simple arithmetic grammar packrat parser<\/a> written in 120 lines of Haskell to about 90 lines of F#. Not bad for a first timer. (Don got it down to 25 lines, using F#&#8217;s new <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dsyme\/archive\/2007\/04\/07\/draft-paper-on-f-active-patterns.aspx\">Active Patterns feature<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>I gearing up for my second talk, which happens right\u00a0after lunch. I recorded a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.virtualteched.com\">Virtual TechEd<\/a> session this morning with the help of my friend <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masteringbiztalk.com\/blogs\/jon\">Jon Flanders<\/a>. It&#8217;s an 8 minute overview of the Rome project, so it is VERY high level. But anything that helps get the word out I see as a good thing, right?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Yesterday was another day of talking primarily to people I know, inside and outside of Microsoft.
