<p>Yesterday was another day of talking primarily to people I know, inside and outside of Microsoft. Got into a long conversation with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj">Gareth Jones</a> and <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/">Peter Provost</a> about combining test-driven and model-driven development. Having done evangelism for five of the last six years, I haven&#8217;t been an agile practitioner. I&#8217;m getting to the point where I feel dirty when I don&#8217;t write tests or don&#8217;t check in, but&nbsp;not dirty enough to actually do anything about it (yet). But practicing or not, it was&nbsp;fascinating to hear Gareth and Peter&nbsp;brainstorm on this topic. </p>
<p>Speaking of&nbsp;storms,&nbsp;we had a downpour here yesterday. Thunderstorm moved right over the convention center &#8211; you could tell by how loud the thunder and rain were. I hit a seam in the storm heading back to my hotel, but I did get drenched heading to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/trika/archive/2007/05/01/mcp-posse-rolls-deep-influencer-party-at-teched.aspx">influencer party</a> @ <a href="http://www.margaritavilleorlando.com/">Margaritaville</a>. The party was fun, after I dried off, though I seem to remember knowing more of the influencers last time I was @ TechEd. Ended up sharing a cab back to the hotel with <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a> and <a href="http://www.doitwith.net/">Mark Miller</a>. Ted&#8217;s like the&nbsp;IT Industry&#8217;s Switzerland, so&nbsp;I took the opportunity to pick his&nbsp;brain on the goings on in other communities &#8211; primarily the Ruby community.</p>
<p>I did get a chance to hack a little code yesterday.&nbsp;As a side effect of my interest in programming language design, I&#8217;m also interested in <a href="http://devhawk.net/Modular+Compilers.aspx">parser development</a>. Towards that end, I&#8217;ve been learning about <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/">Parsing Expression Grammars</a>. The <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/thesis/">original PEG parser</a> was built in Haskell, but I decided to write mine in F#. Even though I had never worked in F# before, I got my parser up and running fairly easily the first time. I did hit one syntax snag that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme">Don Syme</a>&nbsp;helped me with. I&#8217;ll blog this more in detail later, but I ported a <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/icfp02/ArithPackrat.hs">simple arithmetic grammar packrat parser</a> written in 120 lines of Haskell to about 90 lines of F#. Not bad for a first timer. (Don got it down to 25 lines, using F#&#8217;s new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/04/07/draft-paper-on-f-active-patterns.aspx">Active Patterns feature</a>.)</p>
<p>I gearing up for my second talk, which happens right&nbsp;after lunch. I recorded a <a href="http://www.virtualteched.com">Virtual TechEd</a> session this morning with the help of my friend <a href="http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon">Jon Flanders</a>. It&#8217;s an 8 minute overview of the Rome project, so it is VERY high level. But anything that helps get the word out I see as a good thing, right?</p>
