<p>A few people <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,1a9e0102-c263-4226-b1cb-e076c94cf6bc.aspx">took issue</a> with me calling <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/12/Dennis+Miller+Has+Jumped+The+Shark.aspx">Dennis Miller a partisan hack</a>&nbsp;while also expressing relief that the new season of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher">Real Time with Bill Maher</a> was starting. I finally got to watch <a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/episode/2006_02_17_ep67.html">last Friday&#8217;s episode</a>. Sure, they made fun of Dick Cheney&#8217;s hunting accident and had a round of negative things to say about this administrations handling of Iraq (one of the guests was <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/senor-bio.html">Dan Senor</a>, Advisor to the U.S. Presidential Envoy in Iraq) but he also grilled Democratic <a href="http://www.russfeingold.org/">Senator&nbsp;Russ Feingold</a> on the effectiveness of <a href="http://www.russfeingold.org/cfr.php">campain finance reform</a> and came out as pro-wiretapping:</p>

<p>Oh, please, Americans don&#8217;t want privacy. They want attention! They&#8217;ll put a camera in their shower and show it on the Internet! To get on television, they&#8217;ll marry strangers and eat a cow&#8217;s rectum, and ice dance with Todd Bridges. They&#8217;re trying to get on a show called &#8220;Big Brother&#8221;! </p>
<p>We are a nation of exhibitionists from &#8220;me&#8221; to shining &#8220;me.&#8221; And what we really fear isn&#8217;t that someone&#8217;s listening; it&#8217;s that no one&#8217;s listening. This whole country is one big desperate cry for somebody to listen to &#8220;listen to me, photograph me, Google me, read my blog! Read my diary; read my memoir. It&#8217;s not interesting enough? I&#8217;ll make shit up!&#8221; </p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I tell you, this country gave the finger to privacy a long time ago.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Seems like quite a difference to Dennis Miller calling out John Kerry and Howard Dean a year after the election and having nothing at all negative to say about the Bush administration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Out of curiosity, I&#8217;m wondering what people think of Jon Stewart of <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml">The Daily Show</a> fame. Partisan Hack or Not?</p>
