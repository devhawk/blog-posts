It is\u00a0fascinating because I believe that SOA should come from the business, not because of the delivery mechanism, but because of the results. If services will truly make a business more adaptable and responsive to change shouldn&#8217;t all business people desire those results? At the same time they don&#8217;t care how that end is achieved, just that it is. That&#8217;s where we in the IT industry need to do a better job of working out the details amongst ourselves and show the business how SOA can benefit them. Once we do that we should see more SOA adoptions go smoother and real ROI can be seen.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ldscio.org\/about-joel\/\">Joel Dehlin<\/a> has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ldscio.org\/2007\/06\/05\/the-myth-of-youth\/\">blogged<\/a> on the myth of youth being the ones that use instant messaging, publish and read blogs, participate in social networks, etc. I agree that the technology has been integrated into every layer of society.
