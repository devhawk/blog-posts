-   I am a few days behind on this, but [Joe
    McKendrick](http://updates.zdnet.com/tags/Joe+McKendrick.html)[writes](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=887)
    an interesting piece on if businesspeople are begging for SOA. It
    is fascinating because I believe that SOA should come from the
    business, not because of the delivery mechanism, but because of the
    results. If services will truly make a business more adaptable and
    responsive to change shouldn’t all business people desire those
    results? At the same time they don’t care how that end is achieved,
    just that it is. That’s where we in the IT industry need to do a
    better job of working out the details amongst ourselves and show the
    business how SOA can benefit them. Once we do that we should see
    more SOA adoptions go smoother and real ROI can be seen.

    [blogged](http://www.ldscio.org/2007/06/05/the-myth-of-youth/) on
    the myth of youth being the ones that use instant messaging, publish
    and read blogs, participate in social networks, etc. I agree that
    the technology has been integrated into every layer of society. If
    you have ever been at the airport or at a
    [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com/) you know what I mean. Who is
    it exactly that has a [Crackberry
    addiction](http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Technology/story?id=2348779)?
    It seems technology has really become a part of our culture, and
    that it’s not just one age group that is adopting the changes.

    shell](http://blogs.msdn.com/vsxteam/archive/2007/06/05/Announcing-the-Visual-Studio-2008-Shell.aspx)
    was announced at
    [TechEd](http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2007/registration.mspx) yesterday.
    Even
    [Harry](http://devhawk.net/2007/06/06/TechEd+2007+Day+Three.aspx)
    who was on-site missed the release, but it certainly looks
    [cool](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb510103.aspx).
-   If you have ever met me you would quickly discover I have quite a
    background in
    [Unix](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!328.entry).
    That being the case I couldn’t ignore the
    [news](http://scobleizer.com/2007/06/05/sun-releases-new-blades/)
    that Sun is releasing new
    [blades](http://www.podtech.net/scobleshow/technology/1522/sun-microsystems-releases-new-blades)
    for the desktop. I had a blade on my desk for several years and it
    was really a nice system to use. For those that would bash me since
    I work at Microsoft now I will just say that when you support
    Solaris boxes, having one on your desk is quite helpful. I don’t
    take sides in the Holy War.
