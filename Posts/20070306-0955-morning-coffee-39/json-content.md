Short one today as I’m prepping for a presentation I’m delivering later
this morning.

-   The US Patent & Trademark is going to pilot [posting patent
    applications
    online](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/04/AR2007030401263.html).
    Microsoft is one of the pilot companies. Given how broken the patent
    process is these days (note, my opinion – not my employers) nice to
    see at least small steps to solving the problem. (via [Political
    Animal](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_03/010859.php))
-   Joe McKendrick [coins the
    term](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=825)
    “intrapreneurial” talking about SOA and SaaS. I like it.
-   Xbox Live [reaches six million
    members](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/03/06/542176.aspx)
    four months earlier than expected. Congrats!
