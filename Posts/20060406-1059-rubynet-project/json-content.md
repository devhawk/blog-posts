Having written about Ruby in the scope of the [Compiler Dev
Lab](http://devhawk.net/2006/03/15/Compiler+Dev+Lab++Scripting.aspx) and
the [Dual Schema
Problem](http://devhawk.net/2006/03/28/The+Dual+Schema+Problem.aspx), I
was interested to come across the [Ruby.NET
project](http://www.plas.fit.qut.edu.au/rubynet/) from [Queensland
University of Technology](http://www.fit.qut.edu.au/). From the Ruby.NET
home page:

> Our goal is to create a compiler for the Ruby language that targets
> the .NET CLR. We aim to support 100% of Ruby language semantics,
> including all dynamic constructs such as closures and continuations.
> We plan to generate 100% managed and verifiable CIL code.

Sweet!
