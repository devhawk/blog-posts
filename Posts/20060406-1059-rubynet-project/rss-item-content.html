<p>Having written about Ruby in the scope of the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/15/Compiler+Dev+Lab++Scripting.aspx">Compiler Dev Lab</a> and the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/28/The+Dual+Schema+Problem.aspx">Dual Schema Problem</a>, I was interested to come across the <a href="http://www.plas.fit.qut.edu.au/rubynet/">Ruby.NET project</a> from <a href="http://www.fit.qut.edu.au/">Queensland University of Technology</a>. From the Ruby.NET home page:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>Our goal is to create a compiler for the Ruby language that targets the .NET CLR. We aim to support 100% of Ruby language semantics, including all dynamic constructs such as closures and continuations. We plan to generate 100% managed and verifiable CIL code. </p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Sweet!</p>
