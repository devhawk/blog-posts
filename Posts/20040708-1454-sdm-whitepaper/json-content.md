Now that I’m back from vacation, I got my VS2005 Beta 1 VPC’s up and
running. I have two – one for
[Express](http://msdn.microsoft.com/express/) (VC\#/VB/VWD) and one for
the Enterprise Architect. I installed Express because I wanted to see
how realistic they are as day-to-day dev tools. So far, I’m pretty
impressed. I’m going to use VC\# & VWD to build a distributed genealogy
data management system with my cousin
[Dave](http://www.research.philips.com/InformationCenter/Global/FArticleDetail.asp?lArticleId=2625)
and my [dad](http://halpierson.blogspot.com/). Genealogy is pretty
interesting problem domain that can touch on many SOA data management
issues such as ownership, publication of reference data and federated
identity so I think it will be pretty cool.

Of course, I also installed the full-blown
[VS2005](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/), primarily to get access
to the [new modeling
tools](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vsts-arch.asp)
(i.e. Whitehorse). BTW, there’s a relatively new
[whitepaper](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/sdmwp.mspx)
on the System Definition Model (i.e. the meta-model that the Whitehorse
app designer, data center designer and deployment designer modellers are
based on) available. It was published in late April when I was to busy
w/ TechEd prep to notice. The whitepaper describes the SDM meta-model,
the SDM core models and partnership opportunities.
