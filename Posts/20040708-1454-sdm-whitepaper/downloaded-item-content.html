<p>Now that I&#8217;m back from vacation, I got my VS2005 Beta 1 VPC&#8217;s up and running. I have two &#8211; one for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/express/">Express</a> (VC#/VB/VWD) and one for the Enterprise Architect. I installed Express because I wanted to see how realistic they are as day-to-day dev tools. So far, I&#8217;m pretty impressed. I&#8217;m going to use VC# &amp; VWD to build a distributed genealogy data management system with my cousin <a href="http://www.research.philips.com/InformationCenter/Global/FArticleDetail.asp?lArticleId=2625">Dave</a> and my <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/">dad</a>. Genealogy is pretty interesting problem domain that can touch on many SOA data management issues such as ownership, publication of reference data and federated identity so I think it will be pretty cool.</p>
<p>Of course, I also installed the full-blown <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/">VS2005</a>, primarily to get access to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vsts-arch.asp">new modeling tools</a> (i.e. Whitehorse). BTW, there&#8217;s a relatively new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/sdmwp.mspx">whitepaper</a> on the System Definition Model (i.e. the meta-model that the Whitehorse app designer, data center designer and deployment designer modellers are based on) available. It was published in late April when I was to busy w/ TechEd prep to notice. The whitepaper describes the SDM meta-model, the SDM core models and partnership opportunities.</p>
