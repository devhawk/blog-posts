<p>I didn&#8217;t notice right away, but there&#8217;s a new version of the <a href="http://microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=7A728E0E-EB15-499F-A4D7-5757C82B860D&displaylang=en"> Operating .NET Applications</a> book. The original version was missing the chapter on Instrumenting .NET applications since the Enterprise Instrumentation Framework (EIF) hadn&#8217;t shipped yet. EIF is downloadable from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/resources/subdwnld.asp">MSDN Subscriber Downloads</a> for all Enterprise and Universal subscribers. The new version of the book also contains information on Sizing and Capacity Planning.</p>
