  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<ul><li>Many years ago, I picked .net instead of .com as DevHawk's TLD. My old pal Chris picked up devhawk.com and redirected it to the site because he got tired of typing "devhawk ctl-enter" into the browser address bar and getting nothing. He must have let it lapse because now devhawk.com points to what looks like a splog in development. Part of me is annoyed, but a bigger part of me just doesn't give a shit. You - dear reader - have found this site, and that is all I care about.</li><li>A couple of weekends ago, I re-wired my living room to enable surround sound. It meant adding a receiver to the mix, and that pushed us into three remote territory, which is too many. So I picked up a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/features/harmony/US/EN,CRID=2078">Logitech Harmony Universal Remote</a>, since they have one <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/detailsharmony/US/EN,CRID=2084,CONTENTID=11250">specifically for the Xbox 360</a>. So far so good, but I'm not sure my wife likes it much yet. However, their remote config application doesn't run on Vista yet, so I had to bust out the old laptop to get it working.</li><li>I've <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/08/02/LangNET+Is+Helping+Game+Developers.aspx">written about</a><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/specsharp/">Spec#</a> before, but I've never experimented with it. MS Research just released a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/f96c1618-b332-4106-b0fc-911346d5f537/Details.aspx">new version</a> that support VS05, so here's my chance. (via <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1109.aspx">Larkware</a>)</li><li>Speaking of MS Research, the <a href="http://labs.live.com/Deepfish/default.aspx">Deepfish project</a> has released a new <a href="http://labs.live.com/deepfish/dfblogs/Take+Deepfish+For+A+Swim.aspx">tech preview</a>. However, Loke Uei is reporting they've <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lokeuei/archive/2007/03/29/deepfish-technology-preview-available-now.aspx">already maxed out</a> on test accounts. (via <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/03/28/deepfish.aspx">Major Nelson</a>)</li><li>Jeff Atwood says there's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000827.html">no substitute for learning on the battlefield</a>. I always say that the only way to get good at something is to suck at it for a while. Different words, same concept.</li><li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nnaderi/archive/2007/03/27/unit-testing-trickling-into-pro.aspx">According to Naysawn Naderi</a>, the "majority" of unit test features are being added to the Orcas Pro version. This is obviously good news, though personally I <a href="http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2007/03/28/22529.aspx">agree with Brad</a> that they should available separately VS. Not sure it needs to be in the framework itself, inclusion in the .NET Framework SDK is probably sufficient. I also think there should be unit test support in the VS express editions as well. (via <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,e3a8925c-97ac-469b-ad87-f22658f04735.aspx">Knowing.NET</a>)</li><li>I've been digging <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/">Geekdad</a>, but most of the stuff is for older kids. I mean, I'd love to take <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2007/03/karting_with_da.html">my daughter karting</a>, but she's only two and can't reach the pedals! However, I'm itching to try out today's post on <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2007/03/fun_with_image_.html">image searching with younger kids</a>. The kids love to draw on my new tablet, so I'm thinking of not only searching but snipping these images into OneNote for them to doodle on. </li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Greetings,

Interestingly enough, I found this post while checking to see what backlinks has propogated to my new <a title="Web Development Programming" href="http://www.devhawk.com" rel="nofollow">Web Development Programming</a> blog, DevHawk.com. 

I'm sorry to hear that you were annoyed that I picked up the domain. As soon as I saw it listed I thought it was a great name. I see we have similar taste in that regard. 

In any event, I'm a long time programmer (10 years plus). You can see a bunch of sties I've worked on over the years on my portfolio site at www.adhocdevelopment.com. While I admit that most of the content at devhawk.com will be syndicated, there are about a dozen original articles I wrote myself, and I plan to write a new article about one per week. Most of the articles are about ecommerce software, or search engine optimization. 

Anyways, I thought I'd stop by and say , "Hi".]]></wp:comment_content>
