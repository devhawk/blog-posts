You &#8211; dear reader &#8211; have found this site, and that is all I care about.<\/li>\n<li>A couple of weekends ago, I re-wired my living room to enable surround sound. It meant adding a receiver to the mix, and that pushed us into three remote territory, which is too many. So I picked up a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.logitech.com\/index.cfm\/products\/features\/harmony\/US\/EN,CRID=2078\">Logitech Harmony Universal Remote<\/a>, since they have one <a href=\"http:\/\/www.logitech.com\/index.cfm\/products\/detailsharmony\/US\/EN,CRID=2084,CONTENTID=11250\">specifically for the Xbox 360<\/a>. So far so good, but I&#8217;m not sure\u00a0my wife likes it much yet. However, their remote config application doesn&#8217;t run on Vista yet, so I had to bust out the old laptop to get it working.<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;ve <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/08\/02\/LangNET+Is+Helping+Game+Developers.aspx\">written about<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/specsharp\/\">Spec#<\/a> before, but I&#8217;ve never experimented with it.

This is obviously good news, though personally I <a href=\"http:\/\/www.agileprogrammer.com\/dotnetguy\/archive\/2007\/03\/28\/22529.aspx\">agree with Brad<\/a> that they should available separately VS. Not sure it needs to be in the framework itself, inclusion in the .NET Framework SDK is probably sufficient. I also think there should be unit test support in the VS express editions as well.
