  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Greetings,

Interestingly enough, I found this post while checking to see what backlinks has propogated to my new <a title="Web Development Programming" href="http://www.devhawk.com" rel="nofollow">Web Development Programming</a> blog, DevHawk.com. 

I'm sorry to hear that you were annoyed that I picked up the domain. As soon as I saw it listed I thought it was a great name. I see we have similar taste in that regard. 

In any event, I'm a long time programmer (10 years plus). You can see a bunch of sties I've worked on over the years on my portfolio site at www.adhocdevelopment.com. While I admit that most of the content at devhawk.com will be syndicated, there are about a dozen original articles I wrote myself, and I plan to write a new article about one per week. Most of the articles are about ecommerce software, or search engine optimization. 

Anyways, I thought I'd stop by and say , "Hi".]]></wp:comment_content>
