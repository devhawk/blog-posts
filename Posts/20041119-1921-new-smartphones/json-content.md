As I mentioned in my last post, I have a new toy – a [Motorola MPx220
smartphone](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devices/devicedisplay.aspx?module=deviceDisplay;Smartphone;americas;134).
I’m actually lucky enough to have recently laid my hands on two
smartphones. The other was a [dopod
515](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devices/devicedisplay.aspx?module=deviceDisplay;Smartphone;apac;58)
which was a gift from the organizers of TechEd Beijing. The dopod is
nice, but I really dig the MPx220. I’m partial to flip phones, plus the
MPx220 has a camera and Bluetooth.

Of course, one of the benefits of having a smartphone is the ability to
write some custom stuff for it. There are a variety of
[tweaks](http://midnight.modaco.com/?page=tweaks) available that are
predicated on registry modifications. There’s a [registry
editor](http://www.phm.lu/Products/Smartphone/RegEdit/) for Smartphone
2002, but I couldn’t get it to install on since my phone is running
Windows Mobile 2003. Luckily, there’s
[OpenNETCF.org](http://opennetcf.org/CategoryView.aspx?category=Home)
with a wide variety of [useful libraries](http://opennetcf.org/library/)
for compact framework development. They even have registry editing
libraries that work from the
[device](http://opennetcf.org/library/OpenNETCF.Win32.Registry.html) or
the
[desktop](http://opennetcf.org/library/OpenNETCF.Desktop.Communication.CERegistry.html).
Not sure what else I want to write yet other than an app to download
movie times a la the new [SPOT watch movies
channel](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=31b2429e-b516-4edb-8df2-83a244286c07),
but I’m sure I can think of something!
