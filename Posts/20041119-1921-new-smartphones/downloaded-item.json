I&#8217;m actually lucky enough to have recently laid my hands on two smartphones. The other was a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsmobile\/devices\/devicedisplay.aspx?module=deviceDisplay;Smartphone;apac;58\">dopod 515<\/a> which was a gift from the organizers of TechEd Beijing. The dopod is nice, but I really dig the MPx220. I&#8217;m partial to flip phones, plus the MPx220 has a camera and Bluetooth.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, one of the benefits of having a smartphone is the ability to write some custom stuff for it.

They even have registry editing libraries that work from the <a href=\"http:\/\/opennetcf.org\/library\/OpenNETCF.Win32.Registry.html\">device<\/a> or the <a href=\"http:\/\/opennetcf.org\/library\/OpenNETCF.Desktop.Communication.CERegistry.html\">desktop<\/a>.
