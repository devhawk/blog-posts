I mean, I&#8217;m looking forward to movies like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0372784\/\">Batman Begins<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0407304\/\">War of the Worlds<\/a>, but usually it&#8217;s the small quirky films that get my attention. In fact, one of the reasons I&#8217;m excited about Batman Begins is because it&#8217;s directed by Chris Nolan, director of the awesome yet quirky independent film <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0209144\/\">Memento<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Along these lines, I saw something about a movie from Sundance called <a href=\"http:\/\/movies.yahoo.com\/shop?d=hp&amp;id=1808626872&amp;cf=prev\">The Aristocrats<\/a> by Penn Jillette (of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pennandteller.com\/\">Penn &amp; Teller<\/a>). The premise sounds awesome:<\/p>\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\"><p>Magician, comedian and entertainer extraordinaire Penn Jillette takes us into the secret world of comedians as we&#8217;re introduced to a perpetually filthy joke that is never told the same way twice, serving as the comedy equilavent of a jazz solo since the Vaudeville days. All that remains constant is the beginning and the end, and 105 comedians fill in the rest.\u00a0[From <a href=\"http:\/\/movies.yahoo.com\/mv\/upcoming\/\">Greg&#8217;s Previews<\/a> on <a href=\"http:\/\/movies.yahoo.com\">Yahoo Movies<\/a>]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aristocrats has been picked up by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thinkfilmcompany.com\/\">ThinkFilm<\/a>. I hope they get into a theater near me, but clicking thru their site, I don&#8217;t have a lot of confidence. The only movie currently listed on the site that I recognized was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goingupriver.com\/\">Going Upriver<\/a>, a documentary about John Kerry that I heard about late last year during the presidential campain. Combined with the fact that it will likely be released \u201cunrated\u201d as it would likely get an NC-17 rating for langugage, I&#8217;m thinking that I won&#8217;t see it until it gets released on DVD.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Typically, my movie tastes are further down the long tail from the big blockbusters.
