<p>Typically, my movie tastes are further down the long tail from the big blockbusters. I mean, I&#8217;m looking forward to movies like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/">Batman Begins</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304/">War of the Worlds</a>, but usually it&#8217;s the small quirky films that get my attention. In fact, one of the reasons I&#8217;m excited about Batman Begins is because it&#8217;s directed by Chris Nolan, director of the awesome yet quirky independent film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/">Memento</a>.</p>
<p>Along these lines, I saw something about a movie from Sundance called <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&id=1808626872&cf=prev">The Aristocrats</a> by Penn Jillette (of <a href="http://www.pennandteller.com/">Penn &amp; Teller</a>). The premise sounds awesome:</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"><p>Magician, comedian and entertainer extraordinaire Penn Jillette takes us into the secret world of comedians as we&#8217;re introduced to a perpetually filthy joke that is never told the same way twice, serving as the comedy equilavent of a jazz solo since the Vaudeville days. All that remains constant is the beginning and the end, and 105 comedians fill in the rest.&nbsp;[From <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/upcoming/">Greg's Previews</a> on <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com">Yahoo Movies</a>]</p>

<p dir="ltr">Aristocrats has been picked up by <a href="http://www.thinkfilmcompany.com/">ThinkFilm</a>. I hope they get into a theater near me, but clicking thru their site, I don&#8217;t have a lot of confidence. The only movie currently listed on the site that I recognized was <a href="http://www.goingupriver.com/">Going Upriver</a>, a documentary about John Kerry that I heard about late last year during the presidential campain. Combined with the fact that it will likely be released &#8220;unrated&#8221; as it would likely get an NC-17 rating for langugage, I&#8217;m thinking that I won&#8217;t see it until it gets released on DVD.</p>
