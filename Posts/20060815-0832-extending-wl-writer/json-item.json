Basically, there&#8217;s two types of extensions you can build:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>App Launcher &#8211; so you can add a &#8220;Blog It&#8221; button to some other app to remotely launch WL Writer. I assume this is how the WL Toolbar intergration works.\n<\/li>\n<li>Content Source &#8211; so you can add some type of custom content to a post. Typical examples would be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/\">Technorati<\/a> tags or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsxp\/downloads\/powertoys\/wm_create.mspx\">Currently Listening To<\/a> info.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Given that they are trying to support &#8220;every blogging service out there&#8221;, I&#8217;m surprised there&#8217;s not a way to build a plugable blogging service. WL Writer only allows you to customize the content of the post via plugins. Customizing the metadata (i.e. categories) is right out. I realize it&#8217;s the hip thing to put Technorati tags right in your post content, but Technorati also picks up category information which dasBlog already has great support for. What I&#8217;d <em>really<\/em> like is something that acts like del.icio.us&#8217; new post form, where you can free type in your categories, it highlights words as you type and it shows you a list of all your tags so you can click on them.<\/p>\n<p>One other minor note &#8211; WL Writer does a good job for inserting hyperlinks. When you select a word, often the whitespace that follows it is also selected. Some HTML editors will insert the hyperlink over the whole selection &#8211; inlcuding the whitespace which makes no sense. WL Writer gets it right and excludes any trailing whitespace from the hyperlink. Cool!<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So I downloaded the SDK for WL Writer and took a quick look.
