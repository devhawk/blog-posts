<p>So I downloaded <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Windows%20Live%20Writer%20SDK%20(Beta).msi">the SDK</a> for <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Writer.msi">WL Writer</a> and took a quick look. Basically, there's two types of extensions you can build:</p><ul><li>App Launcher - so you can add a "Blog It" button to some other app to remotely launch WL Writer. I assume this is how the WL Toolbar intergration works. 
</li><li>Content Source - so you can add some type of custom content to a post. Typical examples would be <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> tags or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/wm_create.mspx">Currently Listening To</a> info.</li></ul><p>Given that they are trying to support "every blogging service out there", I'm surprised there's not a way to build a plugable blogging service. WL Writer only allows you to customize the content of the post via plugins. Customizing the metadata (i.e. categories) is right out. I realize it's the hip thing to put Technorati tags right in your post content, but Technorati also picks up category information which dasBlog already has great support for. What I'd <em>really</em> like is something that acts like del.icio.us' new post form, where you can free type in your categories, it highlights words as you type and it shows you a list of all your tags so you can click on them.</p><p>One other minor note - WL Writer does a good job for inserting hyperlinks. When you select a word, often the whitespace that follows it is also selected. Some HTML editors will insert the hyperlink over the whole selection - inlcuding the whitespace which makes no sense. WL Writer gets it right and excludes any trailing whitespace from the hyperlink. Cool!</p>
