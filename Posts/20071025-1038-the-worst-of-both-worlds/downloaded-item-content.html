<p>David Pallmann of Neudesic <a href="http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!277.entry" target="_blank">responded</a> to my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/10/19/Morning+Coffee+119.aspx" target="_blank">comment</a> that &#8220;Physically distributed but logically centralized&#8221; didn&#8217;t make any sense to me at all:</p>
<blockquote><p>What exactly does this mean? To some this may sound like a contradiction. </p>
<p>This simply means that a bus is <em>physically</em> more like the point-to-point architecture (spread out, no hub) but <em>functionally</em> more like the hub-and-spoke architecture (pub-sub messaging, centralized configuration and activity tracking, easy change management).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn&#8217;t confused about the seeming contradictory nature of these concepts. In other words, I understand the &#8220;what&#8221; and &#8220;how&#8221; of David&#8217;s physically distributed/logically centralized approach. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand the &#8220;why&#8221;. As in, &#8220;why would you want to do this?&#8221; or &#8220;why do you think this would work at any significant scale?&#8221;. </p>
<p>If we check out Neudesic&#8217;s page on <a href="http://www.neudesic.com/Main.aspx?SS=7&PE=75" target="_blank">their ESB product</a> (which David pointed me to) we find the following blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><u>Centralized Management</u><br></strong>The distributed nature of service oriented programming can create a management nightmare. Neuron&#183;ESB supports this distributed architecture while simultaneously centralizing monitoring and configuration. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>SOA&#8217;s &#8220;distributed nature&#8221; is it&#8217;s primary strength. SOA&#8217;s not primarily about standards or ease-of-connectivity &#8211; though those obviously play a role. It&#8217;s about enabling decentralized decision making. Since you can&#8217;t be both centralized and decentralized, enforcing centralized management basically negates SOA&#8217;s primary strength. This seems like the worst of both worlds to me. All the hassle of distributed decision making combined with all the hassle of centralized management. </p>
<p>Yes, decentralized decision making can create a management nightmare. Personally, a management nightmare is much more attractive anything centralized approaches have ever delivered in the IT industry. </p>
<p>Dare Obasanjo recently wrote &#8220;<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/10/20/IfYouFightTheWebYouWillLose.aspx" target="_blank">If You Fight the Web, You Will Lose</a>&#8220;. He was talking about the Web as a Platform, but it&#8217;s good general advice. Can you imagine applying the marketing blurb above to the Internet at large? </p>
<blockquote><p><strong><u>Centralized Management<br></u></strong>The distributed nature of <strike>service oriented programming</strike> the Internet can create a management nightmare. Neuron&#183;ESB supports this distributed architecture while simultaneously centralizing monitoring and configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Internet can somehow get by without centralized management, why can&#8217;t you?</p>
