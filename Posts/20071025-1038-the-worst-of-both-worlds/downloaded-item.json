To some this may sound like a contradiction. <\/p>\n<p>This simply means that a bus is <em>physically<\/em> more like the point-to-point architecture (spread out, no hub) but <em>functionally<\/em> more like the hub-and-spoke architecture (pub-sub messaging, centralized configuration and activity tracking, easy change management).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, I wasn&#8217;t confused about the seeming contradictory nature of these concepts. In other words, I understand the &#8220;what&#8221; and &#8220;how&#8221; of David&#8217;s physically distributed\/logically centralized approach. <\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand the &#8220;why&#8221;.

Neuron\u00b7ESB supports this distributed architecture while simultaneously centralizing monitoring and configuration. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>SOA&#8217;s &#8220;distributed nature&#8221; is it&#8217;s primary strength. SOA&#8217;s not primarily about standards or ease-of-connectivity &#8211; though those obviously play a role. It&#8217;s about enabling decentralized decision making. Since you can&#8217;t be both centralized and decentralized, enforcing centralized management basically negates SOA&#8217;s primary strength. This seems like the worst of both worlds to me. All the hassle of distributed decision making combined with all the hassle of centralized management. <\/p>\n<p>Yes, decentralized decision making can create a management nightmare. Personally, a management nightmare is much more attractive anything centralized approaches have ever delivered in the IT industry. <\/p>\n<p>Dare Obasanjo recently wrote &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.25hoursaday.com\/weblog\/2007\/10\/20\/IfYouFightTheWebYouWillLose.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">If You Fight the Web, You Will Lose<\/a>&#8220;. He was talking about the Web as a Platform, but it&#8217;s good general advice.
