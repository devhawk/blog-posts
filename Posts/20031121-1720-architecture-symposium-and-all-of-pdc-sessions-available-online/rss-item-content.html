<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/">Duncan</a><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/posts/39122.aspx">blogged</a> that the PDC sessions are <a href="http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/Default.htm">available</a> as streaming audio with synchronized PowerPoints. For those who couldn't attend PDC, or just couldn't get into the room, be sure to check out the Architecture Symposium track featuring <a href="http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/ARC/ARCSYM1.htm">Pat</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/ARC/ARCSYM2.htm">David</a> and <a href="http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/ARC/ARCSYM3.htm">Keith</a>. If you just want the PowerPoints, you can get them <a href="http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/ARC/ARCSYM1_files/Botto_files/ARCSYM1_Helland.ppt">here</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/ARC/ARCSYM2_files/Botto_files/ARCSYM2_Campbell.ppt">here</a> and <a href="http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/ARC/ARCSYM3_files/Botto_files/ARCSYM3_Short.ppt">here</a>.</p><p>I think everyone read Duncan's post since the performance is horrible right now. Don't worry, Duncan said they'll be up there for six months.</p>
