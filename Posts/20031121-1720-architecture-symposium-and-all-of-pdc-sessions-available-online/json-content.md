that the PDC sessions are
[available](http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/Default.htm) as
streaming audio with synchronized PowerPoints. For those who couldn’t
attend PDC, or just couldn’t get into the room, be sure to check out the
Architecture Symposium track featuring
[Pat](http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/ARC/ARCSYM1.htm),
[David](http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/ARC/ARCSYM2.htm) and
[Keith](http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/ARC/ARCSYM3.htm). If you
just want the PowerPoints, you can get them

I think everyone read Duncan’s post since the performance is horrible
right now. Don’t worry, Duncan said they’ll be up there for six months.
