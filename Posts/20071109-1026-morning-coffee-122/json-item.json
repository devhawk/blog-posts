Had a few technical difficulties around here. In the process of moving hosts, so expect more glitches.  <\/li>\n<li>My talk at the p&amp;p Summit on Monday went really well. At least, it felt good and the applause at the end felt genuine. I recorded the audio on my laptop, so I&#8217;ll be posting a Silverlight version as soon as I figure out how to adjust the levels so their somewhat consistent. <a href=\"http:\/\/paraesthesia.com\/archive\/2007\/11\/06\/microsoft-patterns--practices-summit-2007---day-1.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Paraesthesia<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ademiller.com\/blogs\/tech\/2007\/11\/software-factories-a-poor-choice-of-name\/\" target=\"_blank\">#2872<\/a> have reactions.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of the p&amp;p Summit, Scott Hanselman posted his ASP.NET MVC demo from his talk. Said ASP.NET MVC bits aren&#8217;t available yet, so you can&#8217;t, you know, run the demo for yourself. But at least you can review what the ASP.NET MVC code will look like.  <\/li>\n<li>I stopped by the SOA\/BPM conference last week and saw <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masteringbiztalk.com\/blogs\/jon\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jon<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/samgentile.com\/blogs\/samgentile\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sam<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/gsusx\" target=\"_blank\">Jesus<\/a> among others. Spent quite a bit of time talking to Sam and his Neudesic colleagues about this &#8220;physically distributed\/logically centralized&#8221; approach that <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/10\/25\/The+Worst+Of+Both+Worlds.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">I think is hogwash<\/a>. It sounds to me like Neudesic approach is really federated not centralized, though I&#8217;m not sure <a href=\"http:\/\/davidpallmann.spaces.live.com\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">David Pallmann<\/a> would agree. Federated makes much more sense to me than centralized.  <\/li>\n<li>Nick Malik <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/nickmalik\/archive\/2007\/11\/05\/soa-in-the-replication-model.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">continues his series<\/a> on SOA Business Operations Model. I especially like his point that this isn&#8217;t a series of choices, you need to &#8220;look at your company<strong><\/strong>and try to understand which model the business has selected. &#8221;  <\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/powershell\/archive\/2007\/11\/06\/the-community-technology-preview-ctp-of-windows-powershell-2-0.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">first CTP of PowerShell 2.0<\/a> is out! Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/powershell\/archive\/2007\/11\/06\/what-s-new-in-ctp-of-powershell-2-0.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">what&#8217;s new<\/a> on the PowerShell team blog and Jeffrey Snover&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/powershell\/archive\/2007\/11\/08\/teched-what-s-new-for-developers-in-powershell-v2.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">TechEd Presentation<\/a>. (via <a href=\"http:\/\/samgentile.com\/blogs\/samgentile\/archive\/2007\/11\/06\/new-and-notable-201.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Gentile<\/a>)  <\/li>\n<li>Soma announced <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/somasegar\/archive\/2007\/11\/09\/visual-c-libraries-update.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">updates to VC++ coming next year<\/a>, including <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technical_Report_1\" target=\"_blank\">TR1 support<\/a> and a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/vcblog\/archive\/2007\/11\/09\/announcing-a-major-mfc-update-plus-tr1-support.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;major&#8221; MFC upgrade<\/a> to support creating native apps that look like Office, IE or VS. I get supporting TR1, but the idea that <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/vcblog\/archive\/2007\/11\/09\/hola-from-barcelona-and-welcome-to-a-major-mfc-update.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">people are clamoring<\/a> for MFC updates is kinda surprising. Many years ago when I first came to MSFT, a friend asked &#8220;But don&#8217;t you hate Microsoft?&#8221; to which I responded &#8220;No, I just hate MFC&#8221;. Obviously, not everyone agrees with that sentiment.  <\/li>\n<li>Steve Vinoski thinks <a href=\"http:\/\/steve.vinoski.net\/blog\/2007\/10\/29\/theres-no-hope-for-it\/\" target=\"_blank\">there&#8217;s no hope for IT<\/a>. Funny, I keep agreeing with Steve&#8217;s overall point but disagreeing with his reasoning. I still don&#8217;t buy the <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/07\/31\/Is+Serendipity+The+Heart+Of+The+WSREST+Debate.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">serendipity argument<\/a>. I like compiled languages. And I think he&#8217;s overstating the amount of &#8220;real, useful guidance&#8221; for REST floating around. Basically, there&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.oreilly.com\/catalog\/9780596529260\/\" target=\"_blank\">the book<\/a>&#8220;.  <\/li>\n<li>In widely reported news, Windows Live launched their next generation services. Don&#8217;t bother with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/Presspass\/press\/2007\/nov07\/WindowsLiveLaunchPR.mspx\" target=\"_blank\">press release<\/a>, just go to the new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.windowslive.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">WL home page<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of WL, Dare Obasanjo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.25hoursaday.com\/weblog\/2007\/10\/24\/LiveContactsInteractiveSDKTryOutTheWindowsLiveContactsAPI.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">points to<\/a> the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.live.com\/livedata\/sdk\/\">Live Data Interactive SDK page<\/a> where you can experiment with the WL Contacts REST API. It gives you a good sense of how the <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.live.com\/livedata\/web3s.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Web3S protocol<\/a> works. Pretty well, IMO. However, how come <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/bb463953.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">WL Contacts Schema<\/a> doesn&#8217;t include some type of update timestamp for sync purposes? If you wanted to build say a Outlook &lt;&#8211;&gt; WL Contacts sync engine, you&#8217;d have to download the entire address book and grovel thru it for changes every sync.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Web3S, I&#8217;d love to see some info on how one might implement a service using Web3S. Yaron Goland <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goland.org\/appanddare\/\" target=\"_blank\">positions<\/a> Web3S as an alternative to <a href=\"http:\/\/bitworking.org\/projects\/atom\/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-15.html\" target=\"_blank\">APP<\/a> that WL developed because they &#8220;couldn&#8217;t make APP work in any sane way for our scenarios&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure other folks have similar scenarios.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Sorry for the posting lag. Had a few technical difficulties around here.
