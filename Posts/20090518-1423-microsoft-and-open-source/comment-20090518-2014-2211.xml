  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is not a time to be elegant with words. Push it to them VERY hard. Either Microsft stops being an island, or lose developers to open source, probably forever. It's just that simple. The steps they have taken to date may seem like a big deal to Microsoft, but it's no more a bigger-deal than spitting in the ocean. The entire massive growth of the Internet is due to community involvement, not a single company. 

Microsoft has defined open source as its enemy. Everybody feels that. Balmer projects that often. So even though high-profile MVC is released, developers know deep down that there's not one ounce of "corporate" passion behind those bits. Let them know that we know that. Let them know we are looking at open source stacks right now. ]]></wp:comment_content>
