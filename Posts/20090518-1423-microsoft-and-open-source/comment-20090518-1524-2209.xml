The biggest point behind open source is the ability to contribute and become a part of the process - empower the user empower the change. Look thoughout technologies history and you will see how empowering the user has created vast advancements in technology as a whole. Most of Microsoft's community have had a say in the "direction" of Microsoft products, now you will just give them the stirring wheel and allow them to fix their own car.
