  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I recommend reading Pip Coburn's book "The Change Function" 

But the elevator pitch is simple.. present the change function; i.e.

f(perceived crises vs. total perceived pain of adoption)

You should clearly state that by reducing the TPPA (which includes more than cost, such as system requirements, fear of control, etc) by releasing under Ms-PL you are more likely to have more user-oriented adoption. 

And if you can only get one more thing out the door, please put on you slides to release Powershell as Ms-PL for Mono!

Thanks,

Anthony]]></wp:comment_content>
