<p>I&#8217;m sure <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/">my wife</a> will blog this in more detail, but we&#8217;re on vacation so blogging isn&#8217;t top of her mind. Today was my brother&#8217;s wedding &#8211; I was the best man with the whole speech giving and everything. We left the kids with my wife&#8217;s sister tonight, but last night we brought them to the rehearsal dinner. They were the only two kids there but there were straight up amazingly well behaved. All night. Long past their bedtime (though to be honest, we are in Washington DC and still sort of on west coast time). I mean, I expect my kids to behave &#8211; but this was above and beyond. We got to the restaurant around 6pm and didn&#8217;t leave until 9:30! Tonight, at the wedding, several people told us how impressed they were with our kids. I am too.</p>
<p>Just wanted to blog how incredibly proud I am of my kids.</p>
