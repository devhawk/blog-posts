We’ve added a session to the [Architecture Strategy
Series](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series/). The
Technology Roadmap has proven to be a popular session at our
architecture forums. I delivered it twice two weeks ago and I’m
delivering it for a customer later today. The version of the
presentation up on [Architecture
Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture) was delivered by [Norman
Judah](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/judah/default.asp), VP of
Business Development for the Platforms, Technology and Strategy Group.

What’s nice about the Technology Roadmap is that it *isn’t* a product
roadmap (mostly). We talk about the value of technologies themselves,
rather than a list of features each product will have. It also talks
about the market forces at work that are leading us to build the
technologies in the first place. Well worth the watch.
