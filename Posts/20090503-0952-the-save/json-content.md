This is an amazing picture of an amazing save in yesterday’s
[Capitals/Penguins 3-2 nail biting
victory](http://espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=290502023). ([video on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01Ow7Kxaqb4)) The goalie is
Simeon Varlamov who played most of the season at Hershey for the
Capital’s minor league team. But he got the call in game two of the Caps
opening round series against the Rangers and has posted a 1.5 Goals
Against Average since, including two shutouts.
