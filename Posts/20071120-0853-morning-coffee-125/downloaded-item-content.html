<li>So I wasn&#8217;t quite as close to the end of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/deadrising/">Dead Rising</a> as I thought I was. Those who&#8217;ve played the game thru will understand. </li>
<li>After their promising start, the Capitals <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=271119023">lost yet again</a>. At the 20 game point, they&#8217;re now 6-13-1 for a league-worst 13 points. I think we&#8217;re at the point where they need to fire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Hanlon">Glen Hanlon</a>. Nothing personal Glen, but it&#8217;s not getting done. The only problem is who you would replace him with? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hartley">Bob Hartley</a>? Uh, no thanks. I think most Caps fans want <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Hunter">Dale Hunter</a>, but I think he&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Knights#The_Hunter_Era.2C_2000-Present">too involved</a> with the <a href="http://www.ontariohockeyleague.com/stats/roster.php?team_id=14&season_id=32">London Knights</a> &#8211; he&#8217;s co-owner, president and head coach. But if we could get Dale, I&#8217;m guessing Glen would be gone in a heartbeat.</li>
<li>The XNA team blog <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/11/19/now-available-xna-game-studio-2-0-beta.aspx">announced</a> that XNA Game Studio 2.0&#8242;s beta has released. The <a href="http://creators.xna.com/beta/betahome.aspx">download</a> is available from Creators Club Online. The big new feature in this release is network support, and they&#8217;ve shipped a new <a href="http://creators.xna.com/beta/NetRumbleWindows.vsi">starter kit</a> to get you started. </li>
<li>In addition to shipping VS08 &amp; .NET FX 3.5, a new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=3BF4C5CA-B905-4EBC-8901-1D4C1D1DA884&displaylang=en">CTP of SQL 2008</a> shipped yesterday. I couldn&#8217;t find a good overview of what&#8217;s new, but the SQL Express team has a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlexpress/archive/2007/11/19/what-s-new-in-sql-express-2008-november-ctp.aspx">post on what&#8217;s new</a> in just their corner of this release. (via <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/11/20/vs-2008-net-fx-3-5-and-sql-server-2008-ctp-are-here.aspx">Jesus Rodriguez</a>)</li>
<li>In more &#8220;I know it&#8217;s Thanksgiving week, but we&#8217;re shipping anyway&#8221; news, the <a href="http://rubydotnet.googlegroups.com/web/Home.htm">Ruby.NET</a> folks have shipped v0.9 &#8211; the first release since transferring control to the community. Does it run Rails? Not yet, but <a href="http://rubydotnet.googlegroups.com/web/PastPresentFuture.htm#Current">apparently</a> they&#8217;re &#8220;close to getting Ruby on Rails to run successfully&#8221;. One thing that caught my eye is that it includes <a href="http://rubydotnet.googlegroups.com/web/VisualStudioIntegration.htm">VS integration</a>. Nice.</li>
