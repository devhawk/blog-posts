<p>This is a sequel to Dick&#8217;s now-famous <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/WEB2_2005/">Identity 2.0</a> talk. He&#8217;s definitely had an influence on this crowd &#8211; the two speakers after Dick used a similar presentation style. However, what I didn&#8217;t realize from watching the Identity 2.0 talk is that it&#8217;s much more effective on video than in the audience because he&#8217;s spending so much time looking at the screen (though that may be an artifact of a new presentation). </p>
<p>The other thing about this talk is that it&#8217;s basically a product pitch for <a href="http://www.sxip.com/sxip">SXIP 2.0</a>. That &#8211; for me anyway &#8211; was much less interesting than the more conceptual Identity 2.0 talk. However, I will be trying out the new SXIP stuff when I get back home next week.</p>
