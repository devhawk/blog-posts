<li>Dare Obasanjo sez <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=25e5009e-0889-4883-8d03-58e7775882ac">Cool URIs Don&#8217;t Change</a>. He&#8217;s got other versioning advice, but that&#8217;s the main takeaway. Good advice that dovetails nicely with &#8220;<a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,40c0cf83-27b1-49e7-8086-c57d1b5007cd.aspx">It&#8217;s the URI, Stupid</a>&#8220;.  </li>
<li>I usually agree with <a href="http://soa-eda.blogspot.com/">Jack van Hoof&#8217;s</a> stuff, but I don&#8217;t agree with <a href="http://soa-eda.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-implement-loosely-coupled.html">his thoughts</a> on loosely coupled transaction processing.&nbsp;It&#8217;s much better than suggesting the use of&nbsp;2PC system like&nbsp;<a href="http://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/10/wsat/wsat.pdf">WS-AT</a>, but when he writes that &#8220;by design every action has a compensating action to undo the original action&#8221; I am reminded of Pat&#8217;s old post <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2004/08/12/213552.aspx">Why I hate the phrase &#8220;Long Running Transactions&#8221;</a>. Personally, I&#8217;m a fan of using the Tentative Operation or Reservation pattern, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954638.aspx#soade_topic3">described</a> by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/">John Evdemon</a>. Note the lack of a transaction coordinator in that pattern.  </li>
<li>Speaking of service anti-patterns, I wonder how we rationalize the following two statements, both from Microsoft, in documents published by my old team:
<ul>
<li>&#8220;CRUD operations are the wrong level of factoring for a Web service. CRUD operations may be implemented within or across services, but should not be exposed to consumers in such a fashion. This is an example of a service that allowed internal (private) capabilities to bleed into the service&#8217;s public interface.&#8221; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/">John Evdemon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954638.aspx">Principles of Service Design: Service Patterns and Anti-Patterns</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa479349.aspx">Readings in Service Orientation</a></li>
<li>&#8220;It is very common for Entity Services to support a create, read, update and delete (CRUD) interface at the entity level, and add additional domain-speciic operations needed to address the problem-domain and support the application&#8217;s features and use cases.&#8221; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shycohen/">Shy Cohen</a>, Ontology and Taxonomy of Services in a Service-Oriented Architecture, <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/8/b/e8b39fdb-0a4c-4f52-a5bc-9af66b9fa7df/AJ11_EN.zip">Journal 11</a></li>

<li>Ian Thomas wonders <a href="http://itblagger.wordpress.com/2007/05/04/does-erp-suck/">Does ERP suck</a>? In a word: Yes! <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group954" alt=":)">  Seriously, I&#8217;m a strong believer in what Ian alternatively calls &#8220;unbundling&#8221; and &#8220;disaggregation&#8221; of monolithic enterprise systems &#8211; ERP is the most glaring example of such systems.  </li>
<li>Jamie Cansdale is <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2007/05/10/silverlight-console-applications.aspx">figuring out</a> how to host Silverlight&#8217;s CLR outside of the browser. He&#8217;s already got a console runner up and running. He&#8217;s working of adding &#8220;Test&nbsp;With Silverlight&#8221; option to <a href="http://www.testdriven.net/">TestDriven.NET</a>. You go Jamie.</li>
