CRUD operations may be implemented within or across services, but should not be exposed to consumers in such a fashion. This is an example of a service that allowed internal (private) capabilities to bleed into the service&#8217;s public interface.&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jevdemon\/\">John Evdemon<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ms954638.aspx\">Principles of Service Design: Service Patterns and Anti-Patterns<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/architecture\/aa479349.aspx\">Readings in Service Orientation<\/a><\/li>\n<li>&#8220;It is very common for Entity Services to support a create, read, update and delete (CRUD) interface at the entity level, and add additional domain-speciic operations needed to address the problem-domain and support the application\u2019s features and use cases.&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/shycohen\/\">Shy Cohen<\/a>, Ontology and Taxonomy of Services in a Service-Oriented Architecture, <a href=\"http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/e\/8\/b\/e8b39fdb-0a4c-4f52-a5bc-9af66b9fa7df\/AJ11_EN.zip\">Journal 11<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Ian Thomas wonders <a href=\"http:\/\/itblagger.wordpress.com\/2007\/05\/04\/does-erp-suck\/\">Does ERP suck<\/a>?
