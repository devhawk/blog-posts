NORAD has been tracking Santa on Christmas Eve for 50 years. My
mother-in-law remembers listening to it on the radio. Now, they have a
[website](http://www.noradsanta.org/). Apparently, Santa and I visited a
few of the same places this year. Here’s [Santa at Sky
City](http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/1200.jpg) in Auckland, New
Zealand. Here he is at the [Sydney Opera
House](http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/1400.jpg) in Australia. And
[here he is](http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/1600.jpg) at the Great
Wall of China. According to NORAD, Santa hasn’t hit Seattle yet – last
report was at 10pm pacific time and Santa was in Colorado. But I’m sure
he’s on his way.

Happy Holidays everyone.

Update – about 15 minues after I posted this originally, Santa was
[spotted in Seattle](http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/0700.jpg). I
thought I heard something downstairs.
