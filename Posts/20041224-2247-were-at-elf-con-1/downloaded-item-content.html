<p>NORAD has been tracking Santa on Christmas Eve for 50 years. My mother-in-law remembers listening to it on the radio. Now, they have a <a href="http://www.noradsanta.org/">website</a>. Apparently, Santa and I visited a few of the same places this year. Here&#8217;s <a class="grouped_elements" href="http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/1200.jpg" rel="tc-fancybox-group510">Santa at Sky City</a> in Auckland, New Zealand. Here he is at the <a class="grouped_elements" href="http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/1400.jpg" rel="tc-fancybox-group510">Sydney Opera House</a> in Australia. And <a class="grouped_elements" href="http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/1600.jpg" rel="tc-fancybox-group510">here he is</a> at the Great Wall of China. According to NORAD, Santa hasn&#8217;t hit Seattle yet &#8211; last report was at 10pm pacific time and Santa was in Colorado. But I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s on his way.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays everyone.</p>
<p>Update &#8211; about 15 minues after I posted this originally, Santa was <a class="grouped_elements" href="http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/0700.jpg" rel="tc-fancybox-group510">spotted in Seattle</a>. I thought I heard something downstairs. </p>
