<li>Big news on the WGA strike front: the AMPTP <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20172430,00.html">reached a deal</a> with the Directors Guild last weeks. Initial reaction from United Hollywood is <a href="http://unitedhollywood.blogspot.com/2008/01/first-glance-at-deal-summary.html">mixed</a>, but I&#8217;m hopeful this will at least get the AMPTP / WGA talks started again.  </li>
<li>Speaking of new media, Xbox 360 Fanboy has a <a href="http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/01/16/sundance-short-films-coming-to-video-marketplace/">rundown</a> of 45 short films from Sundance that are getting released on Xbox Live Marketplace. That&#8217;s pretty a-typical content for XBLM. Typically, new content on XBLM has been from &#8220;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/jan08/01-06ABCMGMXboxLivePR.mspx">Hollywood Heavyweights</a>&#8220;. I&#8217;m pretty excited to see them branch out content wise.  </li>
<li>Speaking of Xbox 360, seems <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/01/17/556724.aspx">they had a good year</a>. Congrats!  </li>
<li>Still speaking of Xbox 360, everyone <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/01/18/UndertowFreeofCharge.aspx">gets a free copy of Undertow</a> this week.  </li>
<li>Scott Guthrie <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/01/18/UndertowFreeofCharge.aspx">announces</a> the availability of the .NET Framework Source Code. Shawn Burke has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2008/01/16/configuring-visual-studio-to-debug-net-framework-source-code.aspx">instructions</a> for how to use it with VS08. So far, they&#8217;ve made the core base class libraries, ASP.NET, Windows Forms, WPF, ADO.NET and XML available. LINQ, WCF and WF are expected to become available &#8220;in the weeks and months ahead&#8221;.  </li>
<li>Ted Neward wonders if Java is <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/15/Java+QuotDonequot+Like+The+Patriots+Or+QuotDonequot+Like+The+Dolphins.aspx">&#8220;Done&#8221; like the Patriots, or &#8220;Done&#8221; like the Dolphins?</a> If you want my opinion (I&#8217;m guessing yes, since you&#8217;re reading my blog), definitely done like the Dolphins. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK">OpenJDK</a> was a desperation move to make Java &#8220;cool&#8221; again, but it won&#8217;t work. People who want an open source stack are using LAMP and language wonks who saw Java as mainstream SmallTalk have moved on to Ruby. The question will be if <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html">Sun buying MySQL</a> will make Sun cool or MySQL uncool by association. I&#8217;m guessing the latter. </li>
<li>Speaking of Ted, he&#8217;s got a great post about the <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/17/Youre+Without+A+Point+Mr+Zachmann.aspx">relevance of game programming</a> to the mainstream or enterprise developer.  </li>
<li>Speaking of game development, David Weller points to all the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LetsKillDave/~3/218525110/tons-of-content-for-xna-game-studio-2-0.aspx">new XNA GS 2.0 content</a> up on <a href="http://creators.xna.com/">Creators Club Online</a>.  </li>
<li>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/7ac148a7-149b-4056-aa06-1e6754efd36f/Details.aspx">new version (1.9.3.14) of F# out</a>, but no announcement from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/default.aspx">Don</a> regarding what&#8217;s new. I reviewed the release notes, seems like this is primarily a bug-fix release with only very minor feature additions. </li>
<li>Speaking of F#, Don points to <a href="http://sky.fit.qut.edu.au/~neverov/">Greg Neverov&#8217;s</a> implementation of <a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/hell_is_other_languages/archive/2008/01/16/4565.aspx">Software Transactional Memory in F#</a>. This immediately reminded me of <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/13/The+Next+Mainstream+Programming+Language.aspx">Tim Sweeney&#8217;s Next Mainstream Programming Language talk</a>. Tim suggested said language would need to support a combination of side-effect free functional code and software transactional memory. F# is looking to be closer to that language all the time. </li>
<li>Still speaking of F#, Don Syme&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/01/17/expert-f-now-available-really.aspx">Expert F#</a> book is out. I read the draft version &#8211; it rocks &#8211; but I&#8217;m still going to get my own real copy. You should too.  </li>
<li>With their <a href="http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20072008/GS020711.HTM">win Saturday</a>, the Caps are back to .500 for the first time since late October. Since Thanksgiving, the <a href="http://peerlessprognosticator.blogspot.com/2008/01/caps-fansthe-only-power-ranking-youll.html">Caps are 15-7-4</a>. Only four teams in the league have a better record over that time span. We play one of them tonight &#8211; <a href="http://www2.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Preview&gameNumber=725&season=20072008&gameType=2">the Penguins</a> &#8211; and it&#8217;s on <a href="http://www.versus.com/nhl/">Versus</a>, so I&#8217;ll even get to see it. In HD no less.</li>
