That&#8217;s pretty a-typical content for XBLM. Typically, new content on XBLM has been from &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/press\/2008\/jan08\/01-06ABCMGMXboxLivePR.mspx\">Hollywood Heavyweights<\/a>&#8220;. I&#8217;m pretty excited to see them branch out content wise.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Xbox 360, seems <a href=\"http:\/\/gamerscoreblog.com\/team\/archive\/2008\/01\/17\/556724.aspx\">they had a good year<\/a>. Congrats!  <\/li>\n<li>Still speaking of Xbox 360, everyone <a href=\"http:\/\/gamerscoreblog.com\/team\/archive\/2008\/01\/18\/UndertowFreeofCharge.aspx\">gets a free copy of Undertow<\/a> this week.  <\/li>\n<li>Scott Guthrie <a href=\"http:\/\/gamerscoreblog.com\/team\/archive\/2008\/01\/18\/UndertowFreeofCharge.aspx\">announces<\/a> the availability of the .NET Framework Source Code. Shawn Burke has <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/sburke\/archive\/2008\/01\/16\/configuring-visual-studio-to-debug-net-framework-source-code.aspx\">instructions<\/a> for how to use it with VS08. So far, they&#8217;ve made the core base class libraries, ASP.NET, Windows Forms, WPF, ADO.NET and XML available. LINQ, WCF and WF are expected to become available &#8220;in the weeks and months ahead&#8221;.  <\/li>\n<li>Ted Neward wonders if Java is <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/01\/15\/Java+QuotDonequot+Like+The+Patriots+Or+QuotDonequot+Like+The+Dolphins.aspx\">&#8220;Done&#8221; like the Patriots, or &#8220;Done&#8221; like the Dolphins?<\/a> If you want my opinion (I&#8217;m guessing yes, since you&#8217;re reading my blog), definitely done like the Dolphins. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OpenJDK\">OpenJDK<\/a> was a desperation move to make Java &#8220;cool&#8221; again, but it won&#8217;t work. People who want an open source stack are using LAMP and language wonks who saw Java as mainstream SmallTalk have moved on to Ruby. The question will be if <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mysql.com\/news-and-events\/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html\">Sun buying MySQL<\/a> will make Sun cool or MySQL uncool by association. I&#8217;m guessing the latter. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Ted, he&#8217;s got a great post about the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/01\/17\/Youre+Without+A+Point+Mr+Zachmann.aspx\">relevance of game programming<\/a> to the mainstream or enterprise developer.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of game development, David Weller points to all the <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/LetsKillDave\/~3\/218525110\/tons-of-content-for-xna-game-studio-2-0.aspx\">new XNA GS 2.0 content<\/a> up on <a href=\"http:\/\/creators.xna.com\/\">Creators Club Online<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/research\/downloads\/Details\/7ac148a7-149b-4056-aa06-1e6754efd36f\/Details.aspx\">new version (1.9.3.14) of F# out<\/a>, but no announcement from <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dsyme\/default.aspx\">Don<\/a> regarding what&#8217;s new. I reviewed the release notes, seems like this is primarily a bug-fix release with only very minor feature additions. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of F#, Don points to <a href=\"http:\/\/sky.fit.qut.edu.au\/~neverov\/\">Greg Neverov&#8217;s<\/a> implementation of <a href=\"http:\/\/cs.hubfs.net\/blogs\/hell_is_other_languages\/archive\/2008\/01\/16\/4565.aspx\">Software Transactional Memory in F#<\/a>. This immediately reminded me of <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/02\/13\/The+Next+Mainstream+Programming+Language.aspx\">Tim Sweeney&#8217;s Next Mainstream Programming Language talk<\/a>. Tim suggested said language would need to support a combination of side-effect free functional code and software transactional memory. F# is looking to be closer to that language all the time. <\/li>\n<li>Still speaking of F#, Don Syme&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dsyme\/archive\/2008\/01\/17\/expert-f-now-available-really.aspx\">Expert F#<\/a> book is out. I read the draft version &#8211; it rocks &#8211; but I&#8217;m still going to get my own real copy. You should too.  <\/li>\n<li>With their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhl.com\/scores\/htmlreports\/20072008\/GS020711.HTM\">win Saturday<\/a>, the Caps are back to .500 for the first time since late October. Since Thanksgiving, the <a href=\"http:\/\/peerlessprognosticator.blogspot.com\/2008\/01\/caps-fansthe-only-power-ranking-youll.html\">Caps are 15-7-4<\/a>. Only four teams in the league have a better record over that time span. We play one of them tonight &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.nhl.com\/nhl\/app?service=page&amp;page=Preview&amp;gameNumber=725&amp;season=20072008&amp;gameType=2\">the Penguins<\/a> &#8211; and it&#8217;s on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.versus.com\/nhl\/\">Versus<\/a>, so I&#8217;ll even get to see it.
