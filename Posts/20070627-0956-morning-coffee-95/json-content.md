-   [New version of
    dasBlog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DasBlog197ReleaseFinalASPNET11Version.aspx)
    is out, the final version on ASP.NET 1.1 (unless this release “kills
    a kitten” as per Scott Hanselman). I don’t have the time (make the
    time?) to run daily builds, but I do try and upgrade to new major
    releases in a timely fashion. I’m also moving hosters, so expect a
    little downtime around here at some point in the near future.
-   Matt Winkler is doing a series on [alternate WF execution
    patterns](http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle/archive/2007/05/24/different-execution-patterns-with-wf-or-going-beyond-sequential-and-state-machine.aspx).
    His first is the [N of M
    pattern](http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle/archive/2007/06/27/implementing-the-n-of-m-pattern-in-wf.aspx).
    While I can [nitpick some
    things](http://devhawk.net/2006/10/17/wf-clarifications-and-corrections/)
    in WF – especially the [limitations of transaction
    flow](http://devhawk.net/2006/12/11/transactions-in-workflow-foundation-land/)
    – WF’s support for variability and extensibility of execution
    patterns is fraking brilliant. (via [Sam
    Gentile](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/06/27/new-and-notable-175.aspx))
-   Joe McKendrick is all excited about a [SOA built without web
    services](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=904)! We’ve
    been “doing SOA” since the EDI days without web services, so I’m not
    sure this level of excitement – with an exclamation point and
    everything – is warranted. But it is good to see people realize web
    services != SOA. Instead of web services, [CERN is using
    JMS](http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1261398,00.html)
    to move messages around. I don’t know much about
    [JMS](http://java.sun.com/products/jms/overview.html), but I do know
    it supports async and durable messaging, two things I think are
    critical for enterprise services.
-   I [saw on LtU](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2312) that
    there’s a [new
    paper](http://www.research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/publications/OSR2007_RethinkingSoftwareStack.pdf)
    on [Singularity](http://research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/) out.
    For those who don’t know, Singularity is a MS Research platform
    designed for reliability instead of performance. But there’s more
    than just a new paper. According to the project [home
    page](http://research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/), “Singularity
    Version 1.0 is complete. We’ve shipped the Singularity Research
    Development Kit (RDK) to a small number of universities for their
    research efforts.” I wonder if I can get my hands on that RDK?
-   Jeff Atwood is [starting to show
    ads](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000893.html) on
    Coding Horror, but he’s donating “a significant percentage” of the
    ad revenue back into the programming community. He’s starting with
    \$5,000 and Microsoft is matching for a total of \$10,000 to be
    donated to [open source .NET
    projects](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000894.html).
    [Go tell
    Jeff](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000894.html) which
    projects you think he should donate to.
    [Castle](http://www.castleproject.org/) seems to be an early
    favorite.
-   On Monday, Nick Malik
    [posted](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/23/simple-lifecycle-agility-maturity-model.aspx)
    what he called the [Simple Lifecycle Agility Maturity
    Model](http://home.comcast.net/~nickmalik1/vault/Simple_Lifecycle_Agility_Maturity_Model.xls)
    (aka SLAMM) as a way of measuring your “agile factor”. Surprisingly,
    the community response has been zilch. After [Nick’s comments on
    Agile](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/15/tools-for-mort.aspx)
    last week, I figured *someone* would have *something* to say about
    it, even if only to slam it. (Slam SLAMM, ha ha.) Maybe nobody
    opened [the
    spreadsheet](http://home.comcast.net/~nickmalik1/vault/Simple_Lifecycle_Agility_Maturity_Model.xls)
    and saw Mort has an agile factor rating of 71%? Personally, SLAMM
    seems like a rather coarse tool for measuring how agile you are, but
    coarse tools are better than no tools at all.
