<li><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DasBlog197ReleaseFinalASPNET11Version.aspx">New version of dasBlog</a> is out, the final version on ASP.NET 1.1 (unless this release &#8220;kills a kitten&#8221; as per Scott Hanselman). I don&#8217;t have the time (make the time?)to run daily builds, but I do try and upgrade to new major releases in a timely fashion. I&#8217;m also moving hosters, so expect a little downtime around here at some point in the near future.  </li>
<li>Matt Winkler is doing a series on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle/archive/2007/05/24/different-execution-patterns-with-wf-or-going-beyond-sequential-and-state-machine.aspx">alternate WF execution patterns</a>. His first is the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle/archive/2007/06/27/implementing-the-n-of-m-pattern-in-wf.aspx">N of M pattern</a>. While I can <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/10/17/WF+Clarifications+And+Corrections.aspx">nitpick some things</a> in WF &#8211; especially the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/12/11/Transactions+In+Workflow+Foundationland.aspx">limitations of transaction flow</a> &#8211; WF&#8217;s support for variability and extensibility of execution patterns is fraking brilliant.

<li>Joe McKendrick is all excited about a <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=904">SOA built without web services</a>! We&#8217;ve been &#8220;doing SOA&#8221; since the EDI days without web services, so I&#8217;m not sure this level of excitement &#8211; with an exclamation point and everything &#8211; is warranted. But it is good to see people realize web services != SOA. Instead of web services, <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1261398,00.html">CERN is using JMS</a> to move messages around. I don&#8217;t know much about <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/overview.html">JMS</a>, but I do know it supports async and durable messaging, two things I think are critical for enterprise services.  </li>
<li>I <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2312">saw on LtU</a> that there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/publications/OSR2007_RethinkingSoftwareStack.pdf">new paper</a> on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/">Singularity</a> out. For those who don&#8217;t know, Singularity is a MS Research platform designed for reliability instead of performance. But there&#8217;s more than just a new paper. According to the project <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/">home page</a>, &#8220;Singularity Version 1.0 is complete. We&#8217;ve shipped the Singularity Research Development Kit (RDK) to a small number of universities for their research efforts.&#8221; I wonder if I can get my hands on that RDK?  </li>
<li>Jeff Atwood is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000893.html">starting to show ads</a> on Coding Horror, but he&#8217;s donating &#8220;a significant percentage&#8221; of the ad revenue back into the programming community. He&#8217;s starting with $5,000 and Microsoft is matching for a total of $10,000 to be donated to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000894.html">open source .NET projects</a>. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000894.html">Go tell Jeff</a> which projects you think he should donate to. <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/">Castle</a> seems to be an early favorite.  </li>
<li>On Monday, Nick Malik <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/23/simple-lifecycle-agility-maturity-model.aspx">posted</a> what he called the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~nickmalik1/vault/Simple_Lifecycle_Agility_Maturity_Model.xls">Simple Lifecycle Agility Maturity Model</a> (aka SLAMM) as a way of measuring your &#8220;agile factor&#8221;. Surprisingly, the community response has been zilch. After <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/15/tools-for-mort.aspx">Nick&#8217;s comments on Agile</a> last week, I figured <em>someone </em>would have <em>something </em>to say about it, even if only to slam it. (Slam SLAMM, ha ha.) Maybe nobody opened <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~nickmalik1/vault/Simple_Lifecycle_Agility_Maturity_Model.xls">the spreadsheet</a> and saw Mort has an agile factor rating of 71%? Personally, SLAMM seems like a rather coarse tool for measuring how agile you are, but coarse tools are better than no tools at all.</li>
