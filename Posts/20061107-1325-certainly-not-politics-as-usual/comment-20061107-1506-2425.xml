  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Considering that Harry and I are on opposing ends of the political spectrum I find it interesting that I agree with this post. While one party or the other will end up with a slim majority I am not confident that it is enough to get much done in the next 2 years. Of course, the cynic in me doesn't think this is a real bad thing. I am definitely a proponent of a small, less intrusive government.

I also agree that the 2008 Presidential race should be very interesting. An idea that we were discussing earlier would have Dick Cheney resigning following this election, and getting one of the leading candidates into the VP position to get some free campaigning over the next couple of years. I don't see that as likely, but at least it’s an intriguing possibility.

Since I can't post without a small dig at Harry I will say that the DNC doesn't have to spend as much on negative ads since they have the mainstream press to do their dirty work for them. :-)
