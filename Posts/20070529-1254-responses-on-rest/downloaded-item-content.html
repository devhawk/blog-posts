<p>Here is a roundup of some responses to my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/24/REST+Is+Neither+CRUD+Nor+CRAP.aspx">REST</a><a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/25/This+Isnt+The+Droid+Im+Looking+For.aspx">discussion</a> with <a href="http://www.from9till2.com">David Ing</a>. Mostly, I&#8217;m passing them along with minimal&nbsp;comment so I figured I&#8217;d group them into one post.</p>
<p>David started by <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,077A65C2-6DBC-42E5-B927-4BE2D6E1FF98.aspx#acca030a-8507-4c74-af68-a14b430b79b4">leaving me a comment</a>, but decided instead to <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5f9ac25b-6e8d-412f-9a16-f9f0c0dbf9be">post the comments</a> on his blog. His big worry seems to be how well REST as CRUD will interop with REST as protocol. but in general I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s a big worry. Bill de Hora&#8217;s example below about WebDAV <strike>transactions</strike> activities seems to demonstrate at least some RESTifarians are cool with a protocol view of the world.</p>
<p>Erik Johnson (who&#8217;s <a href="http://appside.blogspot.com/">blog</a> I mistakenly purged from my reader at some point, so needless to say I&#8217;ve resubscribed) <a href="http://appside.blogspot.com/2007/05/harry-david.html">writes</a> that &#8220;real-world experience shows you rarely POST exactly what you GET&#8221; and that &#8220;even with the flawed cast of characters you see a lot of whining about&#8230;the pieces are there to build good systems that also make great constituents in anyone&#8217;s SOA.&#8221; I agree 100%. He goes on to agree with me agreeing with <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/default.aspx">Tim</a> for people &#8220;not to limit their comprehension of REST around entities accessed via GET and PUT&#8221;. Generally speaking, I agree with people when they agree with me, and this is no exception. Erik also has <a href="http://appside.blogspot.com/2007/05/rest-protocols-are-service-layer.html">a REST post</a> that predated my dustup with David(*) where he reaches some interesting conclusions about designing REST style systems. </p>
<p>Bill de Hora <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/05/wouldnt_start_from_there.html">weighs in</a>, pointing out that &#8220;value exchange != transaction&#8221;. Given that I never suggested they were equal, I&#8217;m not sure what his point is (other than to be snarky). He also points to <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/webdav-usage.html">Subversion&#8217;s use of WebDAV</a> as an example of&#8230;well, I&#8217;m not sure since it seems to&nbsp;prove&nbsp;my point that a simple CRUD style approach doesn&#8217;t cut it for many scenarios. According to the page Bill linked to:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Subversion commits are modeled using the &#8220;activity&#8221; concept from DeltaV. An activity can be viewed as a <strong>transaction for a set of resources</strong>.&#8221; [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I&#8217;m sure this sounds snarky as well, I really don&#8217;t get what Bill is getting at here. It <em>sounds</em> like he took my disparaging of CRUD as a disparagement of REST, which is NOT how it was intended. This kind of layering of higher-level protocol concepts (like WebDAV&#8217;s activity) is exactly what I was thinking of when I wrote &#8220;I can spurn CRUD and still embrace REST&#8221;.</p>
<p>And though not a direct comment on my post, Omri Gazitt <a href="https://www.gazitt.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,ccf9f2f2-a11f-4b70-bb9f-0141dd1041b6.aspx">writes about</a> REST vs. SOAP and the support for both in the next version of WCF. His main point is that &#8220;It seems like we&#8217;ll continue to live in a world where multiple integration paradigms and protocol choices exist for applications&#8221;. Of course, since he&#8217;s with the WCF product group, regardless of your integration paradigm or protocol choice, WCF is the way to build it (at least on Windows). We&#8217;ll have to wait a while to see if WCF is really &#8220;future-proof&#8221;, but the ability to add <a href="https://www.gazitt.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,a8383226-a0dd-48c5-9fea-33d5da159d17.aspx">significant changes</a> in a .5 release is a fairly good sign. </p>

<p>(*) It&#8217;s a very polite dustup, characterized mostly by agreement rather than disagreement. Which makes it, as dustups go, very boring.</p>
