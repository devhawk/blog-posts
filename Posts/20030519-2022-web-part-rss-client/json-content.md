I’m looking forward to seeing [Simon
Fell’s](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/)[RSS Web
Parts](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/05/1265.html). Makes a nice
addition to [WSS RSS](prj_sharepointsynd.aspx) (which does work in SPS
as well). I haven’t had any time to pick through the new .NET Web Parts
technology – I’m hoping Simon releases code for his RSS web parts.
