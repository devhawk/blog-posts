<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing <a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/">Simon Fell&#8217;s</a><a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/05/1265.html">RSS Web Parts</a>. Makes a nice addition to <a href="prj_sharepointsynd.aspx">WSS RSS</a> (which does work in SPS as well). I haven&#8217;t had any time to pick through the new .NET Web Parts technology &#8211; I&#8217;m hoping Simon releases code for his RSS web parts.</p>
