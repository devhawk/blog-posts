<p>As I&#8217;ve blogged before, I use <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CodeHtmler">CodeHTMLer</a> to post code snippets on my blog. I hear <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter</a> is the new hotness, but since it relies on CSS the syntax highlighting only appears on the website and not in the RSS reader. </p>
<p>The problem with CodeHTMLer is that it only supports a handful of languages out of the box. But the language definition file is simple enough &#8211; just an XML file with a bunch of regular expressions. When I was doing a lot of F# work, I wrote an <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/07/Blogging+F+Code.aspx">F# language definition</a>. Now that I&#8217;m on the IronPython team, go figure I&#8217;m writing a lot of code in Python. I *know* I&#8217;ve written a Python language definition for CodeHTMLer more than once, but I would forget to post it and then lose it when I paved my laptop hard drive. So after doing this three or four times, I&#8217;ve finally remembered to <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Python%20CodeHTMLer.xml">put it up on my SkyDrive</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to install this yourself to colorize Python code snippets with CodeHTMLer, follow the directions I posted earlier with the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/07/Blogging+F+Code.aspx">F# language definition</a>.</p>
