As I’ve blogged before, I use
[CodeHTMLer](http://www.codeplex.com/CodeHtmler) to post code snippets
on my blog. I hear
[SyntaxHighlighter](http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/) is the
new hotness, but since it relies on CSS the syntax highlighting only
appears on the website and not in the RSS reader.

The problem with CodeHTMLer is that it only supports a handful of
languages out of the box. But the language definition file is simple
enough – just an XML file with a bunch of regular expressions. When I
was doing a lot of F\# work, I wrote an [F\# language
definition](http://devhawk.net/2007/12/07/blogging-f-code/). Now
that I’m on the IronPython team, go figure I’m writing a lot of code in
Python. I \*know\* I’ve written a Python language definition for
CodeHTMLer more than once, but I would forget to post it and then lose
it when I paved my laptop hard drive. So after doing this three or four
times, I’ve finally remembered to [put it up on my
SkyDrive](http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Python%20CodeHTMLer.xml).

If you want to install this yourself to colorize Python code snippets
with CodeHTMLer, follow the directions I posted earlier with the [F\#
language
definition](http://devhawk.net/2007/12/07/blogging-f-code/).
