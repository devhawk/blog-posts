Last Thursday, I hosted the [*patterns & practices
Live!*](http://www.pnplive.com/) webcast for [Ron
Jacobs](http://www.ronjacobs.com/). The session was on the [Updater
Application
Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/updaterv2.asp)
with [Eugenio](http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/default.aspx). I should
have posted a link before hand – sorry about that. As soon as I find a
link to the on-demand version, I’ll post it.

Ron is still out this week, so I’m hosting another webcast this coming
Thursday at 11am PDT. The session is on Packaging Design and
Architecture Guidance for Visual Studio and I’m very excited about the
stuff we’ll be showing. Visit the [MS Events
site](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032271514&Culture=en-US)
to sign up for the session.

**Update**: I located the [on-demand
version](http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032271289&EventCategory=3)
of the UAB webcast.
