<p>Last Thursday, I hosted the <a href="http://www.pnplive.com/"><em>patterns &amp; practices Live!</em></a> webcast for <a href="http://www.ronjacobs.com/">Ron Jacobs</a>. The session was on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/updaterv2.asp">Updater Application Block</a> with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/default.aspx">Eugenio</a>. I should have posted a link before hand - sorry about that. As soon as I find a link to the on-demand version, I'll post it. </p><p>Ron is still out this week, so I'm hosting another webcast this coming Thursday at 11am PDT. The session is on Packaging Design and Architecture Guidance for Visual Studio and I'm very excited about the stuff we'll be showing.
