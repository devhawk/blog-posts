So now I’ve started tracking referrers. I’m using the referrer server
variable, and running into canonicalization issues. For example, as I
write this entry, there are 8 referrals from [ASP.NET
Weblog](http://aspnetweblog.com). But it shows up on my list as 3
separate referrers since I’m not sure how to canonicalize the URL. For
example, [Radio](http://radio.userland.com/) users mostly come from the
Radio.Weblogs.com server, so for those users, the specific virtual
folder is important. But for other sites, like aspnetweblog.com, it’s
not. Anyone have a good suggestion?
