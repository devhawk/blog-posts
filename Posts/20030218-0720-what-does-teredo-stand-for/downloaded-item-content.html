<p>I just noticed this yesterday as well. Very cool stuff. I didn&#8217;t realize that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/techinfo/administration/ipv6/default.asp"> XP SP1</a> includes a production quality IPv6 stack (though it&#8217;s still appears as &#8220;developer preview&#8221; in the UI) and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/ipv6/ipv6faq.mspx"> Windows Server 2003</a> takes that support to the next level. Plus <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/productinfo/next/overview.asp"> .NET Framework 1.1</a> includes support for IPv6. Terendo seems pretty cool (traffic IPv6 over IPv4 and bypass NAT issues). However, how much does Teredo (sometimes called Shipworm) rely on UPnP support? The <a href="http://www.huitema.net/talks/NAT-firewalls-IPv6.ppt">slides</a> Doubt linked to claims that it works for &#8220;all NAT&#8221;, but it also discusses UPnP in depth. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://grc.com/unpnp/unpnp.htm">turned off UPnP support</a> on all my machines inside my Linksys NAT, not because of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-059.asp"> security issue</a> but because my NAT doesn&#8217;t behave when it&#8217;s turned on. I have to routinely reset the NAT when UPnP support is turned on. I&#8217;ve updated to the latest firmware, but I&#8217;m still having the problem.</p>
