I didn&#8217;t realize that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsxp\/pro\/techinfo\/administration\/ipv6\/default.asp\"> XP SP1<\/a> includes a production quality IPv6 stack (though it&#8217;s still appears as &#8220;developer preview&#8221; in the UI) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsserver2003\/technologies\/ipv6\/ipv6faq.mspx\"> Windows Server 2003<\/a> takes that support to the next level. Plus <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/netframework\/productinfo\/next\/overview.asp\"> .NET Framework 1.1<\/a> includes support for IPv6. Terendo seems pretty cool (traffic IPv6 over IPv4 and bypass NAT issues). However, how much does Teredo (sometimes called Shipworm) rely on UPnP support? The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huitema.net\/talks\/NAT-firewalls-IPv6.ppt\">slides<\/a> Doubt linked to claims that it works for &#8220;all NAT&#8221;, but it also discusses UPnP in depth. I&#8217;ve <a href=\"http:\/\/grc.com\/unpnp\/unpnp.htm\">turned off UPnP support<\/a> on all my machines inside my Linksys NAT, not because of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/technet\/security\/bulletin\/MS01-059.asp\"> security issue<\/a> but because my NAT doesn&#8217;t behave when it&#8217;s turned on. I have to routinely reset the NAT when UPnP support is turned on. I&#8217;ve updated to the latest firmware, but I&#8217;m still having the problem.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>But what makes [threedegrees] interesting from a tech standpoint is the technology bets that are involved.
