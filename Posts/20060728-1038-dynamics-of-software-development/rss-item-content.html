<p>Speaking of <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/">Sam</a>, he <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2006/07/28/147756.aspx">talks today</a> about one-week iterations and having a "shippable" version of the code every week. Reminds me of Jim McCarthy's classic book "Dynamics of Software Development". One of the many rules from that book is "Get to a Known State and Stay There" - I'm sure that sounds familiar to Sam. Other classic rules include "Don't Flip the Bozo Bit" and "When You Slip, Don't Fall". </p><p>I just noticed MS Press is putting <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/MSPress/books/9691.asp">Dynamics of Software Development</a> back in print with a new cover and a DVD of the the original “21 Rules” presentation that begat the book. It's a great book - I highly recommend it as well as his other book "<a href="http://www.mccarthyshow.com/Books/SoftwareforYourHead/tabid/324/Default.aspx">Software For Your Head</a>". Also, Jim and his wife Michelle are doing a podcast called <a href="http://www.mccarthyshow.com/TheMcCarthyShow/tabid/407/Default.aspx">The McCarthy Show</a>. Subscribed.</p>
