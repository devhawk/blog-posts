Speaking of [Sam](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/), he [talks
today](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2006/07/28/147756.aspx)
about one-week iterations and having a “shippable” version of the code
every week. Reminds me of Jim McCarthy’s classic book “Dynamics of
Software Development”. One of the many rules from that book is “Get to a
Known State and Stay There” – I’m sure that sounds familiar to Sam.
Other classic rules include “Don’t Flip the Bozo Bit” and “When You
Slip, Don’t Fall”.

I just noticed MS Press is putting [Dynamics of Software
Development](http://www.microsoft.com/MSPress/books/9691.asp) back in
print with a new cover and a DVD of the the original “21 Rules”
presentation that begat the book. It’s a great book – I highly recommend
it as well as his other book “[Software For Your
Head](http://www.mccarthyshow.com/Books/SoftwareforYourHead/tabid/324/Default.aspx)“.
Also, Jim and his wife Michelle are doing a podcast called [The McCarthy
Show](http://www.mccarthyshow.com/TheMcCarthyShow/tabid/407/Default.aspx).
