<p>Speaking of <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/">Sam</a>, he <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2006/07/28/147756.aspx">talks today</a> about one-week iterations and having a &#8220;shippable&#8221; version of the code every week. Reminds me of Jim McCarthy&#8217;s classic book &#8220;Dynamics of Software Development&#8221;. One of the many rules from that book is &#8220;Get to a Known State and Stay There&#8221; &#8211; I&#8217;m sure that sounds familiar to Sam. Other classic rules include &#8220;Don&#8217;t Flip the Bozo Bit&#8221; and &#8220;When You Slip, Don&#8217;t Fall&#8221;. </p>
<p>I just noticed MS Press is putting <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/MSPress/books/9691.asp">Dynamics of Software Development</a> back in print with a new cover and a DVD of the the original &#8220;21 Rules&#8221; presentation that begat the book. It&#8217;s a great book &#8211; I highly recommend it as well as his other book &#8220;<a href="http://www.mccarthyshow.com/Books/SoftwareforYourHead/tabid/324/Default.aspx">Software For Your Head</a>&#8220;. Also, Jim and his wife Michelle are doing a podcast called <a href="http://www.mccarthyshow.com/TheMcCarthyShow/tabid/407/Default.aspx">The McCarthy Show</a>. Subscribed.</p>
