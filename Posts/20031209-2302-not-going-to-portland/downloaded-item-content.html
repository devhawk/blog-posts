<p>I hear <a href="http://snowstormlife.com/blog/">Jim Blizzard</a> is having another <a href="http://snowstormlife.com/blog/posts/431.aspx">Portland Nerd Dinner</a>. I wanted to go meet <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/">Rory</a> in person, maybe see <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott</a> (who I haven&#8217;t seen since KL last year) and continue a conversation I was having with <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">Chris</a> last week on campus.&nbsp;Not going to make it this time. I could use the holidays as an excuse, but the truth is that I&#8217;ve got an early morning all-hands division meeting to see <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/film/trilogy/">Return of the King</a>&nbsp;and I&#8217;d like to get more than three hours of sleep. </p>
