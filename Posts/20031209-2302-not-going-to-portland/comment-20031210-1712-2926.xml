  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Harry,

Actually, you did meet Rory at the PDC, but it was a quick intro, and most of the PDC is a blur for us anyway.  I introduced you to him, but you were eating an ice cream bar.  You wicked your fingers, wiped them off, and then went to shake Rory's hand.  Stuart, Bliz and me almost lost it, knowing how Rory is with shaking hands in the first place, no less hands that were just covered in ice cream, and then cleaned by the mouth.  It was priceless, and we all wished we had a video of it.  The both of you then agreed to a virtual handshake from about 3 feet away.
