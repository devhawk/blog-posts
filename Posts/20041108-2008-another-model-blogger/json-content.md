[Gareth Jones](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/) is another blogger from
the VS modeling team. He’s got some great posts on using [OneNote as a
shared
whiteboard](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2004/10/13/241985.aspx)
and the [use of color-coding in
modeling](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2004/10/22/246268.aspx).
Given the fact that a popular use of modelling today is for
[sketching](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/UmlAsSketch.html), it’s
interesting to read about how the team is looking at bringing those
idioms forward while also making the models precice enough to be used as
development artifacts.

BTW, no problem on the [image
“borrowing”](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2004/10/27/248745.aspx)
