<p>I haven't checked it personally, but I hear that <a href="http://devhawk.net/prj_messenger.aspx">Messenger.NET</a> is no longer working. Apparently, MSN shut off access to all versions of their protocol prior to MSNP8 (Messenger.NET uses <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#imcli">imcli</a> which implements MSNP7) <a href="http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/sitev2.0/">back in October</a>. </p><p>There's a good description of the MSNP8 protocol up on <a href="http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/index.php">hypothetic.org</a>Â as well as some info on the changes in <a href="http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/research/msnp9.php">MSNP9</a> and <a href="http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/research/msnp10.php">MSNP10</a>. I don't have time to upgrade imcli and/or Messenger.NET. Any volunteers?</p><p>BTW, as an alternative, I found the <a href="http://members.home.nl/b.geertsema/dotMSN/">dotMSN</a> library on hypothetic's <a href="http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/resources/projects.php">project page</a>. Version 1.1 of dotMSN implements MSNP8. It's free, though the source is not provided. I have no idea if it's any good, but it's the only .NET library for MSN messenger that implements MSNP8 that I could find.</p>
