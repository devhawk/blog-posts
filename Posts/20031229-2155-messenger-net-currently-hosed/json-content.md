I haven’t checked it personally, but I hear that
[Messenger.NET](http://devhawk.net/prj_messenger.aspx) is no longer
working. Apparently, MSN shut off access to all versions of their
protocol prior to MSNP8 (Messenger.NET uses
[imcli](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#imcli) which implements
MSNP7) [back in October](http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/sitev2.0/).

There’s a good description of the MSNP8 protocol up on
[hypothetic.org](http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/index.php) as well
as some info on the changes in
[MSNP9](http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/research/msnp9.php) and
[MSNP10](http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/research/msnp10.php). I
don’t have time to upgrade imcli and/or Messenger.NET. Any volunteers?

BTW, as an alternative, I found the
[dotMSN](http://members.home.nl/b.geertsema/dotMSN/) library on
hypothetic’s [project
page](http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/resources/projects.php).
Version 1.1 of dotMSN implements MSNP8. It’s free, though the source is
not provided. I have no idea if it’s any good, but it’s the only .NET
library for MSN messenger that implements MSNP8 that I could find.
