<p>I saw a <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=30623">post</a> on <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/">TSS.NET</a> pointing to the Outlook 2003 Integration APIs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft has released former &#8220;internal only&#8221; APIs for developing applications that work with Microsoft Outlook. The APIs include account management, connection state, free/busy, MAPI-MIME conversion, and the Outlook store. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea why these APIs have been released at this time, but providing more options/control/tools to developers is better than less &#8211; along the same lines of the <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5eef8774-814a-4f1f-b446-eaf5a039d1b0">ASP.NET 1.1 Membership Prototype</a>. </p>
<p>My only issue is that not all the APIs are documented. For example, recently I was interested in being able to progammatically set Outlook&#8217;s online/offline status. When I read the post above, I thought the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/olintapi/html/oliaAbouttheConnectionStateManagementAPI_HV01155189.asp">Connection State API</a> would be the answer. Alas, that API can only be used to get notification when the connection state changes. Or, at least, that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s documented: the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/olintapi/html/oliaIMAPIOfflineMgr_HV01156488.asp">IMAPIOfflineMgr interface</a> has seven undocumented methods and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/olintapi/html/oliaIMAPIOffline_HV01156492.asp">IMAPIOffline interface</a> has two. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a good reason those others aren&#8217;t documented, but it&#8217;s frustrating all the same.</p>
<p>Of course, even with the ommisions, that&#8217;s a lot of cool stuff to add to <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=e7071b93-7970-4962-a4c2-d72aa2cfbcff">Niobe</a>. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/smguest/">Simon</a>?</p>
