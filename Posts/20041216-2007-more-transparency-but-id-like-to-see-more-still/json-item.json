The APIs include account management, connection state, free\/busy, MAPI-MIME conversion, and the Outlook store. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I have no idea why these APIs have been released at this time, but providing more options\/control\/tools to developers is better than less &#8211; along the same lines of the <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5eef8774-814a-4f1f-b446-eaf5a039d1b0\">ASP.NET 1.1 Membership Prototype<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>My only issue is that not all the APIs are documented. For example, recently I was interested in being able to progammatically set Outlook&#8217;s online\/offline status. When I read the post above, I thought the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/olintapi\/html\/oliaAbouttheConnectionStateManagementAPI_HV01155189.asp\">Connection State API<\/a> would be the answer. Alas, that API can only be used to get notification when the connection state changes. Or, at least, that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s documented: the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/olintapi\/html\/oliaIMAPIOfflineMgr_HV01156488.asp\">IMAPIOfflineMgr interface<\/a> has seven undocumented methods and the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/olintapi\/html\/oliaIMAPIOffline_HV01156492.asp\">IMAPIOffline interface<\/a> has two. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a good reason those others aren&#8217;t documented, but it&#8217;s frustrating all the same.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, even with the ommisions, that&#8217;s a lot of cool stuff to add to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gotdotnet.com\/workspaces\/workspace.aspx?id=e7071b93-7970-4962-a4c2-d72aa2cfbcff\">Niobe<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/smguest\/\">Simon<\/a>?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I saw a post on TSS.NET pointing to the Outlook 2003 Integration APIs: Microsoft has released former &#8220;internal only&#8221; APIs for developing applications that work with Microsoft Outlook.
