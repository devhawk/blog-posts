-   I’ve been off for two weeks, so getting back into “the swing” of
    things will probably take a day or two – both at work and on my
    blog. Hope everyone had a happy holiday season.
-   I ended [the year](http://devhawk.net/monthview.aspx?year=2007) with
    245 blog posts, which wasn’t quite as many as either of my
    [first](http://devhawk.net/monthview.aspx?year=2003)[two](http://devhawk.net/monthview.aspx?year=2004)
    years blogging, but was much more than I had been writing for the
    [last](http://devhawk.net/monthview.aspx?year=2005)[two](http://devhawk.net/monthview.aspx?year=2006)
    years.
-   It was a [Zune](http://www.zune.net) Xmas in the Pierson house. I
    got a pink Zune for my wife, and my mother and father got Zunes for
    each other. I got to load them all up with content for Xmas morning.
    Maybe I’m just used to WMP, but I’m not a huge fan of the Zune
    software. Yes, it’s very pretty but it’s missing some fairly basic
    features like automatic down-sampling lossless music. On the other
    hand, the on-device experience rocks and my wife is using her Zune
    regularly. I’ve got a trip to England coming up in April, and I’m
    thinking about getting one of the new 80GB ones for the trip.
-   They lost any chance of playing for the national championship, but
    USC sure [looked like a champion
    yesterday](http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=280010030).
    Seems appropriate for this crazy college football season that if
    Ohio State doesn’t win big, pretty much all the other BCS bowl
    winners with a legitimate argument to be \#1.
-   The Caps [beat the eastern-conference leading Senators
    yesterday](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/boxscore?gameId=280101023)
    for the third time this season and the second time in four days.
    They have 13 points in the last ten games and 10-5-4 since Boudreau
    took over as coach. If they keep that pace up, they would likely
    make the playoffs – that would be quite a feat given their horrific
    start.
-   Speaking of hockey, I watched most of the [Winter
    Classic](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=280101002)
    yesterday, including the game-winning shootout goal by the [Anointed
    One](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?playerId=3114).
    It was really strange but cool to watch a hockey game between
    snowflakes. I agree with [Scott Burnside’s
    take](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=3176569)
    that these outdoor games are good for the league, but shouldn’t be a
    regular part of the season.
-   I finished [Portal](http://www.xbox.com/games/orangebox) yesterday –
    that’s a [fantastic
    game](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/12/28). I also got
    [Mass Effect](http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect), so now I need
    to decide which to take on first: that or Half-Life 2.
-   A few months ago, I was [thinking
    about](http://devhawk.net/2007/06/23/home-networking-question/)
    using HomePlug for home networking but decided to [upgrade my
    wireless
    network](http://devhawk.net/2007/07/08/upgrading-my-home-wireless-network/)
    instead. But recently I’ve started streaming movies from my loft
    computer to my Xbox, and the wireless network isn’t always up to the
    task. I could run CAT5, but there’s already an unused coax cable
    running up to the loft and I wondered if I could just use that? I
    discovered the [Multimedia over Coax
    Alliance](http://www.mocalliance.org/), but none of their [certified
    products](http://www.mocalliance.org/en/industry/certified_products.asp)
    appear to be available. Those products have to share the home coax
    network with the cable company, but I can dedicate my coax cable.
    Anyone know a way to use coax to bridge CAT5 networks? Even
    something DIY?
