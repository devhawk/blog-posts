Hope everyone had a happy holiday season.<\/li>\n<li>I ended <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/monthview.aspx?year=2007\">the year<\/a> with 245 blog posts, which wasn&#8217;t quite as many as either of my <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/monthview.aspx?year=2003\">first<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/monthview.aspx?year=2004\">two<\/a> years blogging, but was much more than I had been writing for the <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/monthview.aspx?year=2005\">last<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/monthview.aspx?year=2006\">two<\/a> years.<\/li>\n<li>It was a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zune.net\">Zune<\/a> Xmas in the Pierson house. I got a pink Zune for my wife, and my mother and father got Zunes for each other. I got to load them all up with content for Xmas morning. Maybe I&#8217;m just used to WMP, but I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the Zune software. Yes, it&#8217;s very pretty but it&#8217;s missing some fairly basic features like automatic down-sampling lossless music. On the other hand, the on-device experience rocks and my wife is using her Zune regularly. I&#8217;ve got a trip to England coming up in April, and I&#8217;m thinking about getting one of the new 80GB ones for the trip.<\/li>\n<li>They lost any chance of playing for the national championship, but USC sure <a href=\"http:\/\/scores.espn.go.com\/ncf\/recap?gameId=280010030\">looked like a champion yesterday<\/a>. Seems appropriate for this crazy college football season that if Ohio State doesn&#8217;t win big, pretty much all the other BCS bowl winners with a legitimate argument to be #1.<\/li>\n<li>The Caps <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nhl\/boxscore?gameId=280101023\">beat the eastern-conference leading Senators yesterday<\/a> for the third time this season and the second time in four days. They have 13 points in the last ten games and 10-5-4 since Boudreau took over as coach. If they keep that pace up, they would likely make the playoffs &#8211; that would be quite a feat given their horrific start.<\/li>\n<li>Speaking of hockey, I watched most of the <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nhl\/recap?gameId=280101002\">Winter Classic<\/a> yesterday, including the game-winning shootout goal by the <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nhl\/players\/profile?playerId=3114\">Anointed One<\/a>. It was really strange but cool to watch a hockey game between snowflakes. I agree with <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nhl\/columns\/story?columnist=burnside_scott&amp;id=3176569\">Scott Burnside&#8217;s take<\/a> that these outdoor games are good for the league, but shouldn&#8217;t be a regular part of the season.<\/li>\n<li>I finished <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/orangebox\">Portal<\/a> yesterday &#8211; that&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.penny-arcade.com\/comic\/2007\/12\/28\">fantastic game<\/a>. I also got <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/masseffect\">Mass Effect<\/a>, so now I need to decide which to take on first: that or Half-Life 2. <\/li>\n<li>A few months ago, I was <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/06\/23\/Home+Networking+Question.aspx\">thinking about<\/a> using HomePlug for home networking but decided to <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/07\/09\/Upgrading+My+Home+Wireless+Network.aspx\">upgrade my wireless network<\/a> instead. But recently I&#8217;ve started streaming movies from my loft computer to my Xbox, and the wireless network isn&#8217;t always up to the task. I could run CAT5, but there&#8217;s already an unused coax cable running up to the loft and I wondered if I could just use that? I discovered the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mocalliance.org\/\">Multimedia over Coax Alliance<\/a>, but none of their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mocalliance.org\/en\/industry\/certified_products.asp\">certified products<\/a> appear to be available. Those products have to share the home coax network with the cable company, but I can dedicate my coax cable. Anyone know a way to use coax to bridge CAT5 networks? Even something DIY?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;ve been off for two weeks, so getting back into &#8220;the swing&#8221; of things will probably take a day or two &#8211; both at work and on my blog.
