<p>After a week offline, I think I&#8217;ve finally gotten DevHawk back online. I&#8217;m having a few issues from my personal laptop, so if you&#8217;re having issues seeing the site, please <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net">let me know</a>.</p>
<p>I took the downtime to make a few changes to the site. I fixed up a few things with the theme &#8211; I run 120 DPI on both my machines and the theme looked wrong in a few places. Now, except for the main text, I specify font sizes in pixels instead of points so it looks right whatever DPI you run in. Also, I finally got around to updating the stylesheet so the tag list and calendar renders correctly plus I added &#8220;older posts&#8221; and &#8220;newer posts&#8221; links at the bottom of the page. </p>
<p>I also took the opportunity to get rid of my Projects, Articles and Presentations sections. I didn&#8217;t trash the content, I moved it all <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content">to my SkyDrive</a>. But now I&#8217;ve eliminated a bunch of pages from my site that I just never took the time to keep up to date. </p>
<p>Back to regular blogging &#8220;soon&#8221;.</p>
