I fixed up a few things with the theme &#8211; I run 120 DPI on both my machines and the theme looked wrong in a few places. Now, except for the main text, I specify font sizes in pixels instead of points so it looks right whatever DPI you run in. Also, I finally got around to updating the stylesheet so the tag list and calendar renders correctly plus I added &#8220;older posts&#8221; and &#8220;newer posts&#8221; links at the bottom of the page. <\/p>\n<p>I also took the opportunity to get rid of my Projects, Articles and Presentations sections.
