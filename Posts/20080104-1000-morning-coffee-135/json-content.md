-   Congrats to Barack Obama for [walking
    away](http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/03/iowa.caucuses/) with
    the Iowa Democratic Caucus, which [set turnout
    records](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/01/03/democratic-caucus-turnout-shatters-record/).
    Frankly, I’m pretty cool with any of the democratic front runners
    but I think Obama has the best chance of winning in November. I’m
    not sure Edwards second time around will be any more successful than
    the last and I believe Clinton would drive the GOP GOTV campaign
    better than any of the actual GOP candidates would.
-   Obviously, I like to play M-rated games like Bioshock and Mass
    Effect. But I also like games I can play with my kids like [Lego
    Star Wars](http://www.xbox.com/games/legostarwarssaga/). There are
    two new Lego games coming out this year: [Lego Indiana
    Jones](http://www.lucasarts.com/games/legoindianajones/) and [Lego
    Batman](http://videogames.yahoo.com/feature/lego-batman-y-exclusive-trailer/1167883).
    I can’t wait.
-   Speaking of gaming, Xbox LIVE had [some
    issues](http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/12/29/xbox-live-status-12-29.aspx)
    over the holiday break, due to record setting sign-ups and
    concurrent users. Record setting numbers is a nice problem to have
    if you’re on the business side, but a not-so-nice if you’re a
    customer or work in operations. The XBL GM announced they’re
    offering a “[token of
    appreciation](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/live/serviceissue.htm)”
    for everyone’s patience – a free XBLA game. Assuming it’s not a
    crappy game, it’s a classy move.
-   I watched Transformers on HD-DVD last night. Fun movie with lots of
    action, but man is it dumb. [John
    Turturro](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001806/) is the only real
    stand-out.
-   Dustin Campbell
    [implements](http://diditwith.net/2008/01/01/BuildingDataOutOfThinAir.aspx)
    cons, cdr and car from Scheme in C\# and VB. While of limited
    production value (Dustin specifically warns readers not to use any
    of his code), it really demonstrates how different the functional
    world is from the object/imperative one, right down to the concept
    of type. Cons doesn’t return a tuple, it returns function with two
    bound variables. (via
    [DNK](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/csharp/Building_Data_Out_Of_Thin_Air))
