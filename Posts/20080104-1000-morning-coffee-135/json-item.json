Frankly, I&#8217;m pretty cool with any of the democratic front runners but I think Obama has the best chance of winning in November. I&#8217;m not sure Edwards second time around will be any more successful than the last and I believe Clinton would drive the GOP GOTV campaign better than any of the actual GOP candidates would. <\/li>\n<li>Obviously, I like to play M-rated games like Bioshock and Mass Effect. But I also like games I can play with my kids like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/legostarwarssaga\/\">Lego Star Wars<\/a>. There are two new Lego games coming out this year: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lucasarts.com\/games\/legoindianajones\/\">Lego Indiana Jones<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/videogames.yahoo.com\/feature\/lego-batman-y-exclusive-trailer\/1167883\">Lego Batman<\/a>. I can&#8217;t wait. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of gaming, Xbox LIVE had <a href=\"http:\/\/www.majornelson.com\/archive\/2007\/12\/29\/xbox-live-status-12-29.aspx\">some issues<\/a> over the holiday break, due to record setting sign-ups and concurrent users. Record setting numbers is a nice problem to have if you&#8217;re on the business side, but a not-so-nice if you&#8217;re a customer or work in operations. The XBL GM announced they&#8217;re offering a &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/support\/live\/serviceissue.htm\">token of appreciation<\/a>&#8221; for everyone&#8217;s patience &#8211; a free XBLA game. Assuming it&#8217;s not a crappy game, it&#8217;s a classy move. <\/li>\n<li>I watched Transformers on HD-DVD last night. Fun movie with lots of action, but man is it dumb. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0001806\/\">John Turturro<\/a> is the only real stand-out. <\/li>\n<li>Dustin Campbell <a href=\"http:\/\/diditwith.net\/2008\/01\/01\/BuildingDataOutOfThinAir.aspx\">implements<\/a> cons, cdr and car from Scheme in C# and VB. While of limited production value (Dustin specifically warns readers not to use any of his code), it really demonstrates how different the functional world is from the object\/imperative one, right down to the concept of type. Cons doesn&#8217;t return a tuple, it returns function with two bound variables.
