<p>A year ago, I was <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e2d55e21-3063-40ba-a23d-b1ac4d569d8f" __designer:dtid="95864073773645826">pointing out</a> how badly messed up the BCS computer system was, denying the unanimous #1 ranked team in the land a shot at the national championship game. This year, USC has gone wire to wire&nbsp;ranked #1 and will face the #2 Oklahoma Sooners for the national championship. Fight On! </p>
<p __designer:dtid="95864073773645825">Of course, there are those pointing out the fact that #3 Auburn went undefeated creates an &#8220;<a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/story/3218490" __designer:dtid="95864073773645824">unprecedented headache for the BCS</a>&#8220;. Excuse me? What a bunch of crap. The BCS is supposed to make sure there&#8217;s a unified national champion &#8211; something it failed to do last year I might point out &nbsp;- by having the top two teams play each other. USC and Oklahoma have been #1 and #2 all year, and they&#8217;re playing each other. Sure, it sucks to be Auburn, go undefeated and still come up third. But there&#8217;s no question who the top two teams are &#8211; they&#8217;ve been the same all year. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure this will revive the yearly &#8220;BCS sucks, we need a playoff&#8221; talk. Quick memo to playoff people: any college football playoff system is going to screw someone. For example, a 4 team playoff this year (using the BCS rankings) would have been USC, Oklahoma, Auburn and Texas, screwing unanimous #4 ranked Cal. An 8 team playoff would add Cal, Utah, Georgia and Va Tech, but screw Louisville who&#8217;s ranked at least 8th in both polls. Even a 16 team playoff &#8211; which is virtually infeasible &#8211; would screw unanimous #16 ranked Wisconsin. So let&#8217;s not pretend this issue will go away by playing more games. </p>
<p>Do I think the BCS works well now? No, even though USC didn&#8217;t get screwed this year (not exactly a ringing endorsement). Personally, I think BCS computer system should only be used when the polls don&#8217;t agree. There&#8217;s just no objective way to measure the relative records of teams that don&#8217;t play the same teams. Thus, leave it in the hands of the humans, and use the computers to break ties when they happen. It would have given us a USC vs. LSU championship last year and still had a USC vs. OU championship this year.</p>
