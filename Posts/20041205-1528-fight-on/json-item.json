Fight On! <\/p>\n<p __designer:dtid=\"95864073773645825\" xmlns:__designer=\"#unknown\">Of course, there are those pointing out the fact that #3 Auburn went undefeated creates an &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/msn.foxsports.com\/story\/3218490\" __designer:dtid=\"95864073773645824\">unprecedented headache for the BCS<\/a>&#8220;. Excuse me? What a bunch of crap. The BCS is supposed to make sure there&#8217;s a unified national champion &#8211; something it failed to do last year I might point out \u00a0- by having the top two teams play each other. USC and Oklahoma have been #1 and #2 all year, and they&#8217;re playing each other. Sure, it sucks to be Auburn, go undefeated and still come up third. But there&#8217;s no question who the top two teams are &#8211; they&#8217;ve been the same all year. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure this will revive the yearly &#8220;BCS sucks, we need a playoff&#8221; talk. Quick memo to playoff people: any college football playoff system is going to screw someone. For example, a 4 team playoff this year (using the BCS rankings) would have been USC, Oklahoma, Auburn and Texas, screwing unanimous #4 ranked Cal. An 8 team playoff would add Cal, Utah, Georgia and Va Tech, but screw Louisville who&#8217;s ranked at least 8th in both polls. Even a 16 team playoff &#8211; which is virtually infeasible &#8211; would screw unanimous #16 ranked Wisconsin. So let&#8217;s not pretend this issue will go away by playing more games. <\/p>\n<p>Do I think the BCS works well now? No, even though USC didn&#8217;t get screwed this year (not exactly a ringing endorsement). Personally, I think BCS computer system should only be used when the polls don&#8217;t agree. There&#8217;s just no objective way to measure the relative records of teams that don&#8217;t play the same teams. Thus, leave it in the hands of the humans, and use the computers to break ties when they happen. It would have given us a USC vs. LSU championship last year and still had a USC vs. OU championship this year.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>A year ago, I was pointing out how badly messed up the BCS computer system was, denying the unanimous #1 ranked team in the land a shot at the national championship game.
