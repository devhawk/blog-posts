<p>I typically don&#8217;t <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/devhawk.net">search Technorati for incoming links</a> because a significant number of the links to my blog come from my inclusion on dasBlog&#8217;s default blogroll. For example, &#8220;<a href="http://www.dredlog.com/nssucks/">Dutch Railways Suck</a>&#8221; doesn&#8217;t appear to have anything to do with architecture, development or hockey, but they still link to me. However, in checking out Technorati today, I discovered several blogs were linking to me that were out of the ordinary to say the least. Turns out that this picture I took on <a href="http://devhawk.net/back+in+all+blacks.aspx">my trip to Australia two years ago</a> is the number one result when searching both <a href="http://www.live.com/#q=sydney&scope=images">Windows Live Image Search</a> and <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=sydney&hl=en">Google Image Search</a>. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s why this picture shows up on the blog of <a href="http://ckhnat.blogspot.com/2006/05/cast-it-on-waters.html">woman trying to reverse the trends of feminism</a>, a <a href="http://sellinganimage.blogspot.com/2006/05/you-are-plague.html">guy who despises Sydney</a>, a <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/markopasu/Lists/cns!5E117D8B714C025B!288/">couple</a> of <a href="http://blogs.aol.fr/mpeyrotte/Rachel/entries/492">french</a> blogs that I can&#8217;t read and two german blogs &#8211; one&nbsp;<a href="http://ach-ciao.blogspot.com/2006/05/sydney-im-coming.html">I can&#8217;t read</a> and one <a href="http://daniel-does-madison.blogspot.com/2006/05/visa-incident.html">that I can</a>.</p>
