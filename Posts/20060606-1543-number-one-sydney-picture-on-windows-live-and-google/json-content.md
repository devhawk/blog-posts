I typically don’t [search Technorati for incoming
links](http://www.technorati.com/search/devhawk.net) because a
significant number of the links to my blog come from my inclusion on
dasBlog’s default blogroll. For example, “[Dutch Railways
Suck](http://www.dredlog.com/nssucks/)” doesn’t appear to have anything
to do with architecture, development or hockey, but they still link to
me. However, in checking out Technorati today, I discovered several
blogs were linking to me that were out of the ordinary to say the least.
Turns out that this picture I took on [my trip to Australia two years
ago](http://devhawk.net/back+in+all+blacks.aspx) is the number one
result when searching both [Windows Live Image
Search](http://www.live.com/#q=sydney&scope=images) and [Google Image
Search](http://images.google.com/images?q=sydney&hl=en).

I’m guessing that’s why this picture shows up on the blog of [woman
trying to reverse the trends of
feminism](http://ckhnat.blogspot.com/2006/05/cast-it-on-waters.html), a
[guy who despises
Sydney](http://sellinganimage.blogspot.com/2006/05/you-are-plague.html),
a
[couple](http://spaces.msn.com/markopasu/Lists/cns!5E117D8B714C025B!288/)
of [french](http://blogs.aol.fr/mpeyrotte/Rachel/entries/492) blogs that
I can’t read and two german blogs – one [I can’t
read](http://ach-ciao.blogspot.com/2006/05/sydney-im-coming.html) and
one [that I
can](http://daniel-does-madison.blogspot.com/2006/05/visa-incident.html).
