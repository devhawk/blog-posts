<p><strong><u>Jeff Han on Multi-Touch Interfaces <br></u></strong>This was a cool demo, but was basically a live version of the <a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~jhan/ftirtouch/">associated video</a> that made the rounds on the web a few weeks ago. There&#8217;s huge potential here, but he kept doing the same zoom in and out demo over an over. Can&#8217;t wait to see practical availability of this type of device.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cory Ondrejka on Second Life<br></u></strong>I&#8217;d heard of <a href="http://secondlife.com">Second Life</a> before, but I had never really seen it before today. Wow. I hacked around with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSH">MUSHes</a> back in college, so it was a little familiar. But I didn&#8217;t realize there were people <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70153-0.html">making real livings</a> in Second Life. Who knew you could make $150k a year <a href="http://www.anshechung.com/">prospecting virtual real estate</a>? Cory only had 15 minutes to talk, so we only got a taste of Second Life. He&#8217;s got a full session tomorrow, so I&#8217;ll post more then.</p>
<p><strong><u>Linda Stone on Attention, the &#8220;Real&#8221; Aphrodisiac<br></u></strong>Unlike the other talks on attention, this one didn&#8217;t try and frame it as an economy, so that&#8217;s a good start. Linda talked about this state of &#8220;constant partial attention&#8221; that we&#8217;re all pretty much in all the time these days. Her meta point is to value technology based on how it improves the quality of your life &#8211; which of course most technology doesn&#8217;t do today. She also had a great quote: &#8220;Email is an attention chipper shredder. Think <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/">Fargo</a>&#8221;. Heh.</p>
<p><strong><u>Mark Pilgrim on GreaseMonkey<br></u></strong>Maybe I&#8217;ve been living under a rock, but I&#8217;ve never used <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org">GreaseMonkey</a> so I wanted to see what it was all about. Mark&#8217;s a great presenter, so it was a fun session though it wasn&#8217;t as much about GreaseMonkey as you might expect. Mark spent a significant amount of time on how to become an expert and when to write (while you&#8217;re still filled with wonder and before you become an expert). Great advice, but at best tangentially related to the topic at hand. He also spent a bunch of time on how they dealt with some security issues he discovered. That did lead to some discussion about how GreaseMonkey works with respect to sandboxing and the like. I guess I&#8217;ll just need to download it and play with it.</p>
