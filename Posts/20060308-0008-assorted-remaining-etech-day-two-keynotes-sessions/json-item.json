Can\u2019t wait to see practical availability of this type of device.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Cory Ondrejka on Second Life<br \/><\/u><\/strong>I\u2019d heard of <a href=\"http:\/\/secondlife.com\">Second Life<\/a> before, but I had never really seen it before today. Wow. I hacked around with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/MUSH\">MUSHes<\/a> back in college, so it was a little familiar. But I didn\u2019t realize there were people <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/news\/technology\/0,70153-0.html\">making real livings<\/a> in Second Life. Who knew you could make $150k a year <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anshechung.com\/\">prospecting virtual real estate<\/a>? Cory only had 15 minutes to talk, so we only got a taste of Second Life. He\u2019s got a full session tomorrow, so I\u2019ll post more then.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Linda Stone on Attention, the \u201cReal\u201d Aphrodisiac<br \/><\/u><\/strong>Unlike the other talks on attention, this one didn\u2019t try and frame it as an economy, so that\u2019s a good start. Linda talked about this state of \u201cconstant partial attention\u201d that we\u2019re all pretty much in all the time these days. Her meta point is to value technology based on how it improves the quality of your life \u2013 which of course most technology doesn\u2019t do today. She also had a great quote: \u201cEmail is an attention chipper shredder. Think <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0116282\/\">Fargo<\/a>\u201d. Heh.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Mark Pilgrim on GreaseMonkey<br \/><\/u><\/strong>Maybe I\u2019ve been living under a rock, but I\u2019ve never used <a href=\"http:\/\/greasemonkey.mozdev.org\">GreaseMonkey<\/a> so I wanted to see what it was all about. Mark\u2019s a great presenter, so it was a fun session though it wasn\u2019t as much about GreaseMonkey as you might expect. Mark spent a significant amount of time on how to become an expert and when to write (while you\u2019re still filled with wonder and before you become an expert). Great advice, but at best tangentially related to the topic at hand. He also spent a bunch of time on how they dealt with some security issues he discovered. That did lead to some discussion about how GreaseMonkey works with respect to sandboxing and the like. I guess I\u2019ll just need to download it and play with it.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Jeff Han on Multi-Touch Interfaces This was a cool demo, but was basically a live version of the associated video that made the rounds on the web a few weeks ago.
