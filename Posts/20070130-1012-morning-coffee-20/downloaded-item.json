It took me a few minutes yesterday to figure this out, but the validators are invoked not only for the activities in workflows, but for the actual activity implementation itself. My validation logic is checking to ensure properties are specified and that given activities are or are not inside a <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.workflow.componentmodel.transactionscopeactivity.aspx\">transaction scope<\/a>. Obviously, the activity implementation is invalid according to these rules. Also, you need to remove the Workflow.Targets import from your activity project file, as that is what invokes the activity validation. <\/li>\n<li>A quick follow-up to yesterday&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/01\/29\/Compiling+Workflows.aspx\">compiling workflows post<\/a>: WF appears to be fairly short on out of the box functionality, but more than makes up for it with an expansive extensibility model.
