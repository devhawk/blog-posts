Caps Playoff Math isn&#8217;t as dire as say Clinton&#8217;s Nomination Math, but they are three games back of the Hurricanes with twelve to play.  <\/li>\n<li>Ted Neward has a pretty good <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/magazine\/cc164244.aspx\">F# overview article<\/a> in the most recent MSDN Magazine. I say pretty good because I wonder if someone with no functional programming experience will &#8220;get it&#8221;. As much as I like F# and functional programming, I think some of the basic concepts don&#8217;t pass Don Box&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchgear.com\/2008\/02\/05\/microsoft-readying-model-driven-programming-tools\/\">two beer test<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Ted, somehow his feed fell off my radar (bad DevHawk!) and I missed several great posts like <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/02\/18\/Modular+Toolchains.aspx\">Modular Toolchains<\/a> (note to Ted, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/research\/pubs\/view.aspx?msr_tr_id=MSR-TR-2003-32\">A Research C# Compiler<\/a>), <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/02\/18\/Why+We+Need+Both+Static+And+Dynamic+In+The+Same+Language.aspx\">Why we need both static and dynamic in the same language<\/a> (note to self, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/cobra-language.com\/\">Cobra<\/a>) and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/02\/20\/The+Fallacies+Remain.aspx\">The Fallacies Remain&#8230;.<\/a> (recently, I&#8217;m the guy shouting about risks).  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of MSDN Magazine, have you seen their <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/magazine\/default.aspx\">new site redesign<\/a>? I can&#8217;t find any announcement of it, but man the site looks great.  <\/li>\n<li>If you missed MIX, the <a href=\"http:\/\/sessions.visitmix.com\/\">sessions<\/a> are all online already. That was fast. <\/li>\n<li>John Lam <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iunknown.com\/2008\/03\/dynamic-silve-3.html\">blogs<\/a> about the availability of the <a href=\"http:\/\/dynamicsilverlight.net\/\">Dynamic Silverlight bits<\/a>. Apparently, Dynamic Silverlight includes more recent bits than the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyId=4E03409A-77F3-413F-B108-1243C243C4FE&amp;displaylang=en\">Silverlight 2 SDK<\/a>, which does includes binaries and tools for IronPython, IronRuby and Managed JScript (<a href=\"http:\/\/silverlight.net\/Quickstarts\/ProgramDlr.aspx\">quickstart<\/a>). So you can get started with dynamic languages on Silverlight using the SL SDK alone, but I expect that the Dynamic Silverlight bits will be updated more regularly than the SDK. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>My Xbox 360 started flashing the dreaded Red Ring of Death on Friday. &lt;sigh&gt; I&#8217;m not going to have much time to play in the next week, so it&#8217;s not the end of the universe, but I did have to dig an old DVD player out of the garage for interim duty.
