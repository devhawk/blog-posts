<li>My Xbox 360 started flashing the dreaded <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/907534">Red Ring of Death</a> on Friday. &lt;sigh&gt; I&#8217;m not going to have much time to play in the next week, so it&#8217;s not the end of the universe, but I did have to dig an old DVD player out of the garage for interim duty. </li>
<li>My Caps really stepped in it over the weekend dropping two games they had to have and by most reports (aka according to my dad) that they dominated most of the way. Caps Playoff Math isn&#8217;t as dire as say Clinton&#8217;s Nomination Math, but they are three games back of the Hurricanes with twelve to play.  </li>
<li>Ted Neward has a pretty good <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164244.aspx">F# overview article</a> in the most recent MSDN Magazine. I say pretty good because I wonder if someone with no functional programming experience will &#8220;get it&#8221;. As much as I like F# and functional programming, I think some of the basic concepts don&#8217;t pass Don Box&#8217;s <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/02/05/microsoft-readying-model-driven-programming-tools/">two beer test</a>.  </li>
<li>Speaking of Ted, somehow his feed fell off my radar (bad DevHawk!) and I missed several great posts like <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/02/18/Modular+Toolchains.aspx">Modular Toolchains</a> (note to Ted, check out <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?msr_tr_id=MSR-TR-2003-32">A Research C# Compiler</a>), <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/02/18/Why+We+Need+Both+Static+And+Dynamic+In+The+Same+Language.aspx">Why we need both static and dynamic in the same language</a> (note to self, check out <a href="http://cobra-language.com/">Cobra</a>) and <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/02/20/The+Fallacies+Remain.aspx">The Fallacies Remain&#8230;.</a> (recently, I&#8217;m the guy shouting about risks).  </li>
<li>Speaking of MSDN Magazine, have you seen their <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/default.aspx">new site redesign</a>? I can&#8217;t find any announcement of it, but man the site looks great.  </li>
<li>If you missed MIX, the <a href="http://sessions.visitmix.com/">sessions</a> are all online already. That was fast. </li>
<li>John Lam <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-3.html">blogs</a> about the availability of the <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/">Dynamic Silverlight bits</a>. Apparently, Dynamic Silverlight includes more recent bits than the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=4E03409A-77F3-413F-B108-1243C243C4FE&displaylang=en">Silverlight 2 SDK</a>, which does includes binaries and tools for IronPython, IronRuby and Managed JScript (<a href="http://silverlight.net/Quickstarts/ProgramDlr.aspx">quickstart</a>). So you can get started with dynamic languages on Silverlight using the SL SDK alone, but I expect that the Dynamic Silverlight bits will be updated more regularly than the SDK. </li>
