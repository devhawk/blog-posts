<p>I try to spend more time writing original content for this site and less time simply pointing at other people&#8217;s stuff. However, you&#8217;ll notice the lack of updates around here lately. Things are busy at home &#8211; my wife and I are expecting our second child this week! So the dearth of content will continue for now&#8230;</p>
<p>However, while I remain too busy to blog, here are a couple of other new blogs worth reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>David Ing&#8217;s blog <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/">From 9 till 2</a> is a must read. He asked for <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c8e30df7-f420-435c-8b7c-9843e6b4a863">no gratuitous linking</a>, but it&#8217;s too good to keep secret. Not only does David have valuable insights, he&#8217;s also funny. Check out his thoughts on <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6011a529-8914-4160-8f2f-0ce7b988310c">SOA Versioning</a>, <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6011a529-8914-4160-8f2f-0ce7b988310c">Domain Specific Languages</a>, <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ec8f632f-54f1-42b3-b5ae-4d63627cb9eb">Smart Clients</a> and <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=75b62342-4864-42c1-ae6d-0326707295af">Wikis</a>. But whatever you do, don&#8217;t miss his post on the <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d15dc549-22ca-4b2a-bdcf-7d9704d4f34a">Cold War</a> of OO-&gt;SOA, building on Ted&#8217;s <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20041003#1096871640048">Vietnam War analogy</a> of object/relational mapping. </li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wojtek">Wojtek Kozaczynski</a> is an architect for patterns &amp; practices and is heavily involved with the Guidance Automation Toolkit <a href="http://devhawk.net/Introducing+The+Guidance+Automation+Toolkit.aspx">I blogged about</a> two weeks ago. He writes in his introductory post that he&#8217;s started blogging now to talk about the GAT, starting with a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wojtek/archive/2005/05/02/414129.aspx">brief history</a> of how it came to be.</li>
</ul>
