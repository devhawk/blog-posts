<p>I try to spend more time writing original content for this site and less time simply pointing at other people's stuff. However, you'll notice the lack of updates around here lately. Things are busy at home - my wife and I are expecting our second child this week! So the dearth of content will continue for now...</p><p>However, while I remain too busy to blog, here are a couple of other new blogs worth reading:</p><ul><li>David Ing's blog <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/">From 9 till 2</a> is a must read. He asked for <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c8e30df7-f420-435c-8b7c-9843e6b4a863">no gratuitous linking</a>, but it's too good to keep secret. Not only does David have valuable insights, he's also funny. Check out his thoughts on <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6011a529-8914-4160-8f2f-0ce7b988310c">SOA Versioning</a>, <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6011a529-8914-4160-8f2f-0ce7b988310c">Domain Specific Languages</a>, <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ec8f632f-54f1-42b3-b5ae-4d63627cb9eb">Smart Clients</a> and <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=75b62342-4864-42c1-ae6d-0326707295af">Wikis</a>. But whatever you do, don't miss his post on the <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d15dc549-22ca-4b2a-bdcf-7d9704d4f34a">Cold War</a> of OO-&gt;SOA, building on Ted's <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20041003#1096871640048">Vietnam War analogy</a> of object/relational mapping. </li><li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wojtek">Wojtek Kozaczynski</a> is an architect for patterns &amp; practices and is heavily involved with the Guidance Automation Toolkit <a href="http://devhawk.net/Introducing+The+Guidance+Automation+Toolkit.aspx">I blogged about</a> two weeks ago.
