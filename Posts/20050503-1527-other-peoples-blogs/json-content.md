I try to spend more time writing original content for this site and less
time simply pointing at other people’s stuff. However, you’ll notice the
lack of updates around here lately. Things are busy at home – my wife
and I are expecting our second child this week! So the dearth of content
will continue for now…

However, while I remain too busy to blog, here are a couple of other new
blogs worth reading:

-   David Ing’s blog [From 9 till 2](http://www.from9till2.com/) is a
    must read. He asked for [no gratuitous
    linking](http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c8e30df7-f420-435c-8b7c-9843e6b4a863),
    but it’s too good to keep secret. Not only does David have valuable
    insights, he’s also funny. Check out his thoughts on [SOA
    Versioning](http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6011a529-8914-4160-8f2f-0ce7b988310c),
    [Domain Specific
    Languages](http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6011a529-8914-4160-8f2f-0ce7b988310c),
    [Smart
    Clients](http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ec8f632f-54f1-42b3-b5ae-4d63627cb9eb)
    and
    [Wikis](http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=75b62342-4864-42c1-ae6d-0326707295af).
    But whatever you do, don’t miss his post on the [Cold
    War](http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d15dc549-22ca-4b2a-bdcf-7d9704d4f34a)
    of OO-\>SOA, building on Ted’s [Vietnam War
    analogy](http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20041003#1096871640048)
    of object/relational mapping.
-   [Wojtek Kozaczynski](http://blogs.msdn.com/wojtek) is an architect
    for patterns & practices and is heavily involved with the Guidance
    Automation Toolkit [I blogged
    about](http://devhawk.net/Introducing+The+Guidance+Automation+Toolkit.aspx)
    two weeks ago. He writes in his introductory post that he’s started
    blogging now to talk about the GAT, starting with a [brief
    history](http://blogs.msdn.com/wojtek/archive/2005/05/02/414129.aspx)
    of how it came to be.
