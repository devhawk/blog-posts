<p>First <a href="http://www.simonguest.com/">Simon</a>,Â then <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ramkoth/">Ram</a>, now another member of the .NET Enterprise Architecture Team is blogging. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dphill/">David Hill</a> just started, but he's already posted an article entitled "<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dphill/articles/43260.aspx">A Simplified Asynchronous Call Pattern for WinForm Applications</a>". In the article, David describes "how you can implement a simpler asynchronous call pattern which allows you to consume web services from a WinForm application without having to worry about threads ever again."
