First [Simon](http://www.simonguest.com/), then
[Ram](http://weblogs.asp.net/ramkoth/), now another member of the .NET
Enterprise Architecture Team is blogging. [David
Hill](http://weblogs.asp.net/dphill/) just started, but he’s already
posted an article entitled “[A Simplified Asynchronous Call Pattern for
WinForm
Applications](http://weblogs.asp.net/dphill/articles/43260.aspx)“. In
the article, David describes “how you can implement a simpler
asynchronous call pattern which allows you to consume web services from
a WinForm application without having to worry about threads ever again.”
Cool!
