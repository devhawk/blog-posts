I’m glad the [NHL](http://www.nhl.com/) is back. I’m glad that I get to
watch [some games in
HD](http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/1377/?tf=NHLArticleWrapper.tpl).
But it’s more than a little disconcerting to see commercials for hunting
shows and other so called “[field
sports](http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/961/?tf=nwArticle.tpl)”
during breaks in the action.

I’m not sure that having the NHL on the same station as “[Wanted: Ted or
Alive](http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/1346/?UserDef=true&catID=78)”
is really helping the sports image.
