<p>I&#8217;m glad the <a href="http://www.nhl.com/">NHL</a> is back. I&#8217;m glad that I get to watch <a href="http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/1377/?tf=NHLArticleWrapper.tpl">some games in HD</a>. But it&#8217;s more than a little disconcerting to see commercials for hunting shows and other so called &#8220;<a href="http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/961/?tf=nwArticle.tpl">field sports</a>&#8221; during breaks in the action. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure that having the NHL on the same station as &#8220;<a href="http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/1346/?UserDef=true&catID=78">Wanted: Ted or Alive</a>&#8221; is really helping the sports image.</p>
