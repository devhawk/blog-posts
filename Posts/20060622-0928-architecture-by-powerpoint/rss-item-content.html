<p><a href="http://www.echoes.com/">Adam Stanley</a>Â left the following comment about the MS booth @ the Gartner EA Summit and I just had to share.</p><blockquote><p>One of the true revalations of being an enterprise architect is in the books that Microsoft was giving away. One on enterprise patterns, one of powerpoint. I do a lot of powerpoint! :)</p></blockquote><p>The book in question is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/MSPress/books/7125.asp">Beyond Bullet Points</a>, which I highly recommend to architects and non-architects alike.</p>
