I had asked Ted to introduce me to some dynamic language folks for some research and public debate purposes, and Neal was one of the people he hooked me up with. Unfortunately, this was right before I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/01\/24\/Architect+On+The+Edge.aspx\">changed roles<\/a> and got real busy. Of course, dynamic languages in general and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ruby-lang.org\/en\/\">Ruby<\/a> in particular plays a large role in Edge Architecture, so I\u2019m thankful Neal took the time to drop me a line and meet with me.<\/p>\n<p>Above all else, talking to Neal made me realize that I just don\u2019t know enough about dynamic languages, which limits my ability to discuss them. To date, I\u2019ve flirted with them, but haven\u2019t made a real commitment. For example, I\u2019ve played around with <a href=\"http:\/\/instantrails.rubyforge.org\/\">Instant Rails<\/a>, but hadn\u2019t actually <a href=\"http:\/\/rubyforge.org\/projects\/rubyinstaller\/\">installed Ruby<\/a> yet. It was time to re-image my dev partition anyway, so I\u2019m going to try using Ruby exclusively for a while.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a brain dump of some of what we talked about. Not sure what it all means yet, so I\u2019ll try and refrain from making commentary.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hungarian notation for interfaces (i.e. ISomething) is a big <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Code_smell\">code smell<\/a>. This has nothing really to do with Ruby or dynamic languages, but it\u2019s an important point that I wanted to include here. Neal\u2019s point is that the interface defines the semantics of the type and the concrete class is an \u201cimplementation detail\u201d. In other words, contract-first isn\u2019t just for web services. Apparently, ThoughtWorks doesn\u2019t use ADO.NET directly primarily because the interfaces \u201caren\u2019t pervasive enough\u201d and are difficult to mock out. Also, they\u2019re using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ayende.com\/projects\/rhino-mocks.aspx\">Rhino Mocks<\/a> which I wasn\u2019t previously aware of.<\/li>\n<li>For all the debate about static vs. dynamic languages, it seems like the value Ruby brings is in meta-programming rather than dynamic typing. Certainly, that\u2019s one of the big differentiators for Ruby vs. other dynamic languages like Python. While <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rubyonrails.com\/\">Rails<\/a> has pushed the popularity of Ruby thru the roof recently, Neal seems much more enamored with Ruby than Rails. <\/li>\n<li>There is an even bigger gulf between dynamic and static typing proponents than I had thought. I brought up <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/os\/singularity\/\">Singularity<\/a>, which uses static typing exclusively to deliver a provably dependable system. Neal disagreed with that approach, pointing out that \u201ctests are the best way of encoding the specification of the system\u201d rather than compile time checking. Given my lack of expertise in this space, I\u2019m withholding comment (for now) but I\u2019m guessing the truth is somewhere in the middle.<\/li>\n<li>However, while the dynamic vs. static typing gulf is big, meta-programming is potentially the bridge. I don\u2019t believe meta-programming is exclusive to dynamic languages. Certainly, some of the new features in the \u201cOrcas\u201d versions of C# and VB bring more expressiveness to the languages while still remaining type safe. <\/li>\n<li>All this meta-programming leads to domain specific languages. Ruby has strong support what <a href=\"http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/\">Martin Fowler<\/a> called \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/articles\/languageWorkbench.html#InternalDsl\">internal DSLs<\/a>\u201d, but Neal thought over time the focus would shift to <a href=\"http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/articles\/languageWorkbench.html#ExternalDsl\">external DSLs<\/a> as they are more expressive and not constrained by the semantics of an existing language. Obviously, we\u2019re pretty <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/vstudio\/dsltools\/\">heavily focused<\/a> on DSLs. However, Neal did think our focus on graphical DSLs is misplaced. He called them a \u201changover\u201d from CASE\/UML tools. He rightfully pointed out that \u201cbusiness analysis speak English\u201d. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All in all, it was time well spent. Neal, I hope we can pick up the conversation again sometime.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I spent a couple of hours chatting with Neal Ford from ThoughtWorks yesterday.
