I&#8217;ve been experimenting with LINQ and wanted to be able to use it in a web application I&#8217;m prototyping. Under the file system model, there&#8217;s no easy way to change the compiler used for dynamic compilation of web pages. With WAP, it&#8217;s no problem.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve got both WAP and LINQ installed, you can enable LINQ support in your web apps by doing the folllowing.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open your WebApp.csproj file in notepad.<\/li>\n<li>Add references to System.Query, System.Data.DLinq and System.Xml.XLinq.<\/li>\n<li>Change the Target Import element to import &#8220;$(ProgramFiles)LINQ PreviewMiscLinq.targets&#8221; instead of &#8220;$(MSBuildBinPath)Microsoft.CSharp.targets&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! Seems simple, but it let me bind a GridView to the following function:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush:csharp\">public static IEnumerable GetTitles()\r\n{\r\n  var con = new SqlConnection(Properties.Settings.Default.PubsConString);\r\n  var db = new Pubs(con);\r\n  var q = from t in db.Titles select t;\r\n\r\n  return q;\r\n}<\/pre>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It would be even cooler if I could simply write that query in the conext of the ObjectDataSource, but of course ObjectDataSource doesn&#8217;t know about LINQ. I imagine a LinqDataSource would be a logical next step.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I never really missed Web Application Project support in VS05 until I realized what I could do with it.
