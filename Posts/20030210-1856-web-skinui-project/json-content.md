Since the MSDN magazine is “on the streets”, I’ve added a project page
for the [Web.SkinUI project](prj_webskin.aspx). It will be a place for
me to post updates and errata. I’ve already got a couple of things on my
to do list, and I’m open to more
[suggestions](mailto:harry@devhawk.net?subject=Web.SkinUI).
