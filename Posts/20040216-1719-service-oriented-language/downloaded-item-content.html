<p>I like Jeff&#8217;s <a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/archives/2004_01_11_schneider_archive.html#107409153082470089">suggestions</a> for a Service Oriented Lanugage as well as RebelGeekz&#8217; <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/rebelgeekz/archive/2004/02/02/1686.aspx">idea</a> of how to include XML Infoset information in a language without resorting to angle brackets. I wonder what a community developed lanugauge would look like? I&#8217;ve experimented with <a href="http://dotnet.jku.at/Projects/Rotor">Coco/R</a> which really reduces the effort it takes to build a parser. Of course, the language design and code generation are the hard parts!</p>
<p><a href="http://cocotools.sscli.net/">Source for Coco/R</a> is available on the <a href="http://www.sscli.net/servlets/ProjectList">Rotor Community Projects page</a>. Other cool projects include a port of Rotor to <a href="http://wince-port.sscli.net/">WinCE</a>, two different AOP projects &#8211; <a href="http://aop-in-csharp.sscli.net/">one for C#</a> and the other <a href="http://aspect-dot-net.sscli.net/">language neutral</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;a set of <a href="http://aspect-dot-net.sscli.net/">improved collections</a>. </p>
