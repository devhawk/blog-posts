They just released <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/Windows\/windows-7\/default.aspx\">a new version<\/a> recently you might be aware of\u2026Actually, I hear it was <a href=\"http:\/\/seattletimes.nwsource.com\/html\/microsoftpri0\/2010119125_windows_7_launch_microsoft_new_ads_say_windows_was.html\">your idea<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Seriously, I am <em><u>stoked<\/u><\/em>to be joining the Windows team. I can\u2019t say much about the new job beyond a) it\u2019s in Windows Client (as opposed to Windows Server) and b) I\u2019m working on a team that\u2019s focused on the Windows developer experience. The Windows team is deep in what you might call \u201cbuilding on teh awesome that is Windows 7\u201d but that they simply call \u201cplanning\u201d, so sorry if specifics are kinda sparse. I\u2019ll be back working for <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/maheshp\">Mahesh Prakriya<\/a>, who originally hired me into my current role on the IronPython team. Someday I might tell you the Mahesh PyCon Lego Story, but for now I\u2019ll just say I was great working for Mahesh the first time and I think this time is going to be even better. <\/p>\n<p>Working on Windows\u2026focused on developer experience\u2026for Mahesh &#8211; It\u2019s like the perfect storm of work geekdom for me.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, starting a new job means my time on the IronPython team is coming to an end. As excited as I am about this new opportunity in the Windows division, I\u2019m a little sad to be leaving Developer Division and the IronPython team. I\u2019ve joked with audiences that I care about Python because Microsoft pays me to care about Python, but that\u2019s not completely true. <a href=\"http:\/\/python.org\/\">Python<\/a> is a fantastic language and IronPython\u2019s combination of Python + .NET is hard to beat in my opinion. IronPython has made significant progress while I\u2019ve been here the last eighteen months \u2013 two major releases (well, 2.6 is almost done), redisting the Python standard library, Visual Studio 2010 compat &#8211; but there\u2019s still much for IronPython to accomplish. And of course, leaving behind such great teammates like <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dinoviehland\">Dino<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/davefugate\">Dave<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jredville\">Jim<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jschementi\">Jimmy<\/a> is ALWAYS hard. <\/p>\n<p>The Windows team is somewhat tighter lipped than the totally transparent approach we use in IronPython. Not to worry, my evangelism skills were part of the reason I got the job so you\u2019ll be hearing plenty from me soon enough. However, my posting here will be kinda sparse until I get my bearings over there. Until then, I\u2019m sure that you will be absolutely fascinated by non-work-related-but-still-sometimes-geeky minutia I <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/devhawk\">post on Twitter<\/a>.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Big news in DevHawk land: I\u2019ll be taking on a new role in the Windows division after I come back from TechEd Europe (plus a week vacation visiting my bro-in-law in Germany after TechEd).
