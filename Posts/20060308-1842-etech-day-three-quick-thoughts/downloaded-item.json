But here are a few quick thoughts. More details to follow.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;m digging the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.live.com\/\">Live.com home page<\/a>\u00a0and the integrated Live Search. Since I&#8217;m on a rented laptop, <a href=\"http:\/\/toolbar.live.com\/\">Live Toolbar<\/a> will have to wait. Coolest new feature IMO is the <a href=\"http:\/\/microsoftgadgets.com\/Macros\">Search Macros<\/a>, though it&#8217;s a tight race with the new image search interface.\n<\/li>\n<li>Jon Udell and Michael Goldhaber spoke about attention economy today. I still don&#8217;t get it, though Jon had some interesting ideas about metadata.\u00a0I&#8217;ll believe that attention is a currency when I can buy a car with it.\n<\/li>\n<li>I liked the session on the <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/ypatterns\">Yahoo! Design Patterns<\/a>, though the title and abstract of the session were awful. The title was &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/conferences.oreillynet.com\/cs\/et2006\/view\/e_sess\/8602\">The Language of Attention: A Pattern Approach<\/a>&#8220;. The inclusion of attention just confused the issue. Why couldn&#8217;t they just call it &#8220;A Pattern Language for User Experience&#8221;? Because it doesn&#8217;t have the concept of attention shoehorned into it.\n<\/li>\n<li>I really like\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/eventful.com\/\">Eventful<\/a>, even though I&#8217;m <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/02\/13\/Web+20+Evolution.aspx\">on record<\/a> as thinking their business model doesn&#8217;t work. Their new <a href=\"http:\/\/eventful.com\/demand\">demand feature<\/a> is pretty cool, though it doesn&#8217;t really help their business model any.\n<\/li>\n<li>George Dyson&#8217;s session on &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/conferences.oreillynet.com\/cs\/et2006\/view\/e_sess\/8035\">Turing&#8217;s Cathedral<\/a>&#8221; was fascinating, though he tried to cover too much ground in the time alloted.\n<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m not sure what the point of Joel Spolsky&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/conferences.oreillynet.com\/cs\/et2006\/view\/e_sess\/8323\">Blue Chip Report Card<\/a> was. Apparently the alien from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\">Reddit<\/a> is cute and Motorola newer cell phones (RAZR and PEBL) are taking Joel&#8217;s advice on becoming &#8220;blue chip&#8221;. This is somewhat related to points the folks from Adobe (previously Macromedia) made, except much more obtuse.\n<\/li>\n<li>I have no idea what the point or business model of Plum is, even though it was <a href=\"http:\/\/conferences.oreillynet.com\/cs\/et2006\/view\/e_sess\/9004\">featured<\/a> as a keynote (a last minute promotion it appears from the conference guide). Seems too complex and centralized to actually work.\n<\/li>\n<li>I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/03\/08\/Felipe+Cabrera+On+Amazons+Mechanical+Turk.aspx\">wrote last night<\/a>\u00a0that Casting Words isn&#8217;t really a business because nothing stops me from going directly to Mechanical Turk and getting the transcription services myself. Today, I found a Casting Words task on Mechanical Turk so I decided to figure out how much they&#8217;re making. The task I found was to transcribe about 28 minute podcast and they were offering $5.41 for anyone willing to do it. That&#8217;s about 19.5 cents per minute. Tack on Amazon&#8217;s 10% charge brings the total to around 21.5 cents a minute that Casting Words is paying for transcription services. Given that they&#8217;re charging 42 cents a minute, that&#8217;s just under a 49% profit margin. Exactly what are they doing to earn that profit? What&#8217;s their value add and is really worth a 100% markup?\n<\/li>\n<li>Anyone want to start &#8220;Cheap Casting Words&#8221; with me? We&#8217;ll pay 22 cents a minute (11% more than Casting Words) and charge 36 cents a minute (14% less than Casting Words) and keep the 12 cents a minute markup (a 33% markup). <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>UPDATE (8:45pm) &#8211; Added Quick Thoughts on Yahoo!, Eventful, George Dyson, Joel Spolsky and Plum. Added more detail about the attention economy sessions from today.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>After my marathon blogging session last night and taking notes all day, I&#8217;m a bit burnt out on writing.
