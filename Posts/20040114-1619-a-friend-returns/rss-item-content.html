<p>My old teammate <a href="http://rickculpepper.net/">Rick Culpepper</a> quit working for Microsoft several months ago because he couldn't hack the travel. Of course, neither could I - but there are alot more non-travel positions in Redmond, WA than Nashville, TN. Good news for Microsoft, Rick's <a href="http://rickculpepper.net/posts/162.aspx">back</a> as a TAM for the healthcare vertical. </p><p>Welcome back, Rick!</p><p>Update - Apparently, I can't spell "Culpepper" or "months". Corrected.</p>
