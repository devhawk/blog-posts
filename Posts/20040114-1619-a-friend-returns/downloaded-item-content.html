<p>My old teammate&nbsp;<a href="http://rickculpepper.net/">Rick Culpepper</a>&nbsp;quit working for Microsoft several months ago because he couldn&#8217;t hack the travel. Of course, neither could I -&nbsp;but there are alot more non-travel positions in Redmond, WA than Nashville, TN. Good news for Microsoft, Rick&#8217;s <a href="http://rickculpepper.net/posts/162.aspx">back</a>&nbsp;as a TAM for the healthcare vertical. </p>
<p>Welcome back, Rick!</p>
<p>Update &#8211; Apparently, I can&#8217;t spell &#8220;Culpepper&#8221; or &#8220;months&#8221;. Corrected.</p>
