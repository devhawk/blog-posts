My old teammate [Rick Culpepper](http://rickculpepper.net/) quit working
for Microsoft several months ago because he couldn’t hack the travel. Of
course, neither could I - but there are alot more non-travel positions
in Redmond, WA than Nashville, TN. Good news for Microsoft, Rick’s
[back](http://rickculpepper.net/posts/162.aspx) as a TAM for the
healthcare vertical.

Welcome back, Rick!

Update – Apparently, I can’t spell “Culpepper” or “months”. Corrected.
