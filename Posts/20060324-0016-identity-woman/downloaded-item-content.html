<p>I&#8217;ve been to Mashup Camp, ETech and MIX in the past month and a half. So has Kaliya, otherwise known as <a href="http://www.kaliyasblogs.net/Iwoman/">Identity Woman</a>. She calls MS out for a <a href="http://www.identitywoman.net/?p=296">http://www.identitywoman.net/?p=296</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.identitywoman.net/?p=293">lack of an official wiki for the event</a>. She&#8217;s right on both counts. I thought some of the logistics of ETech were suspect, but they sure did assume that every single attendee would need power and laid out power strips accordingly. </p>
<p>I kept seeing Kaliya at these events, but I didn&#8217;t get to meet her until she came to the SPARK @ MIX session Monday afternoon. She&#8217;s one of the organizers of the <a href="http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2006a/announcement.shtml">Internet Identity Workshop</a>. Sounds like a cool event, but it&#8217;s right before my daughter Rileyanne&#8217;s first birthday and you know <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/techiewife">Jules</a>&nbsp;would NEVER forgive me for missing that. </p>
