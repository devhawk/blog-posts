I’ve been to Mashup Camp, ETech and MIX in the past month and a half. So
has Kaliya, otherwise known as [Identity
Woman](http://www.kaliyasblogs.net/Iwoman/). She calls MS out for a
[lack of power bars @ MIX06](http://www.identitywoman.net/?p=296) as well as the [lack of an
official wiki for the event](http://www.identitywoman.net/?p=293). She’s
right on both counts. I thought some of the logistics of ETech were
suspect, but they sure did assume that every single attendee would need
power and laid out power strips accordingly.

I kept seeing Kaliya at these events, but I didn’t get to meet her until
she came to the SPARK @ MIX session Monday afternoon. She’s one of the
organizers of the [Internet Identity
Workshop](http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2006a/announcement.shtml).
Sounds like a cool event, but it’s right before my daughter Rileyanne’s
first birthday and you know
[Jules](http://spaces.msn.com/techiewife) would NEVER forgive me for
missing that.
