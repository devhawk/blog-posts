<p>The PDC folks pushed out a <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/View.aspx?post=91d46819-8472-40ad-a661-2c78acb4018c:8675956">bunch of new sessions</a> yesterday, including a bunch from my part of DevDiv. You can see the <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Agenda/Sessions.aspx">full list of sessions</a> that have been published (so far) at the <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com">PDC site</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>An Introduction to F#        <br></strong>Learn about Microsoft&#8217;s new language, F#, a typed functional programming language for the .NET Framework. F# combines functional programming with the runtime support, libraries, tools, and object model of .Net. Understand how F# asynchronous workflows help tame the complexity of parallel and asynchronous I/O programming and how to use F# in conjunction with tools such as Parallel Extensions for .NET.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Dive: Dynamic Languages in .NET        <br></strong>The CLR has great support for dynamic languages like IronPython. Learn how the new Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) adds a shared dynamic type system, a standard hosting model, and support for generating fast dynamic code. Hear how these features enable languages that use the DLR to share code with other dynamic and static languages like VB.NET and C#. </p>
<p><strong>Future Directions for Visual Basic        <br></strong>Come learn about the new capabilities in the next version of the language, including: extensions to LINQ, syntax simplifications, and improvements to the IDE. We&#8217;ll provide insight into the direction of the language, including dynamic binding, meta-programming, and scripting. </p>
<p><strong>The Future of C#        <br></strong>In this talk Microsoft Technical fellow and C# Chief Architect Anders Hejlsberg outlines the future of C#. He will describe the many forces that influence and shape the future of programming languages and explain how they fit into C#. </p>
<p><strong>Visual C++: 10 is the New 6        <br></strong>Get more done. The next version of Visual C++ is all about improving developer productivity for large-scale applications. Learn about the IntelliSense and browsing experiences, changes to the project and build system, project-less browsing, collaboration through remote symbol indexing, and custom visualization of symbolic information. </p>
