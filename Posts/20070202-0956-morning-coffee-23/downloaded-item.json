I ordered it around 11:30pm on Wednesday and it arrived yesterday around 2pm.That&#8217;s good service! And so much more convenient than the USB smart card reader.\n<\/li>\n<li>I also mentioned yesterday that I had moved my laptop over to Vista. I&#8217;m not sure why, but my battery life has gotten significantly better. Maybe it&#8217;s because these days I&#8217;m primarily using my laptop to remote into my desktop so I&#8217;m not exercising the local system much.\n<\/li>\n<li>I was checking out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oreilly.com\/catalog\/windowspowershell\/\">Windows PowerShell Quick Reference<\/a>\u00a0from O&#8217;Reilly (on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/whatis\/safari.csp\">Safari<\/a>) and discovered this PS offers the numeric constants of <tt>gb<\/tt>, <tt>mb<\/tt>, and <tt>kb<\/tt> to represent gigabytes, megabytes, and kilobytes. Example: $downloadTime = (1gb + 250mb) \/ 120kb. That&#8217;s pretty cool.\n<\/li>\n<li>Speaking of PS,\u00a0I stumbled across <a href=\"http:\/\/pluralsight.com\/blogs\/dan\/archive\/2006\/11\/07\/41936.aspx\">PowerSMO!<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/pluralsight.com\/blogs\/dan\/\">Dan Sullivan<\/a>. Instead of building native PS support for SQL administration, PowerSMO! makes it easy to access SMO objects in PS. Instead of having to call &#8220;new-object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Wmi.ManagedComputer&#8221;, you call &#8220;Get-SMO_ManagedComputer&#8221;. Even more interestingly, PowerSMO! uses metaprograming techniques to generate all the Get_SMO* methods. It iterates over all the SMO types &#8211; about 1000 types in total &#8211; and generates the associated Get-SMO functions into a temp script file. Once the temp file is created, it can be invoked like any other script. Must noodle on this approach further. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>My Binding Across States post made it to the home page of DotNetKicks, so at last six other people liked it.
