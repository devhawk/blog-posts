<li>My <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/25/Binding+Across+States+In+WF.aspx">Binding Across States</a> post made it to the home page of DotNetKicks, so at last six other people liked it. I wonder if I&#8217;ll be able to detect and traffic increase from that.

<li>I wrote yesterday that I had ordered a PCMCIA Smart Card reader for my laptop. I ordered it around 11:30pm on Wednesday and it arrived yesterday around 2pm.That&#8217;s good service! And so much more convenient than the USB smart card reader.
</li>
<li>I also mentioned yesterday that I had moved my laptop over to Vista. I&#8217;m not sure why, but my battery life has gotten significantly better. Maybe it&#8217;s because these days I&#8217;m primarily using my laptop to remote into my desktop so I&#8217;m not exercising the local system much.
</li>
<li>I was checking out <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/windowspowershell/">Windows PowerShell Quick Reference</a>&nbsp;from O&#8217;Reilly (on <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/whatis/safari.csp">Safari</a>) and discovered this PS offers the numeric constants of <tt>gb</tt>, <tt>mb</tt>, and <tt>kb</tt> to represent gigabytes, megabytes, and kilobytes. Example: $downloadTime = (1gb + 250mb) / 120kb. That&#8217;s pretty cool.
</li>
<li>Speaking of PS,&nbsp;I stumbled across <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dan/archive/2006/11/07/41936.aspx">PowerSMO!</a> from <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dan/">Dan Sullivan</a>. Instead of building native PS support for SQL administration, PowerSMO! makes it easy to access SMO objects in PS. Instead of having to call &#8220;new-object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Wmi.ManagedComputer&#8221;, you call &#8220;Get-SMO_ManagedComputer&#8221;. Even more interestingly, PowerSMO! uses metaprograming techniques to generate all the Get_SMO* methods. It iterates over all the SMO types &#8211; about 1000 types in total &#8211; and generates the associated Get-SMO functions into a temp script file. Once the temp file is created, it can be invoked like any other script. Must noodle on this approach further. </li>
