Things have been a little busy this week so I haven\u2019t had a ton of time to play it. I bought <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/games\/theelderscrollsIVoblivion\/\">Oblivion<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/games\/kameo\">Kameo<\/a>, but have spent most of my time playing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/games\/livearcadexbox360\">Xbox Live Arcade<\/a>. Seems sort of stupid to shell out $400 to play <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/games\/hexichdlivearcadexbox360\/\">Hexic<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/games\/unolivearcadexbox360\/\">UNO<\/a>, but it actually a compelling experience for a number of reasons. First off, they\u2019re games you can play for 10-15 minutes at a time. Playing Oblivion for 15 minutes is pointless, but it\u2019s perfect for a Live Arcade game. With two kids, 15 minutes of play time is much more common than 2 hours. Second, you don\u2019t have to get up to put in a game disc. Sure it\u2019s lazy, but aren\u2019t we all lazy sometimes? Third, I can play them in front of my kids. Fourth, they\u2019re cheap and easy to download on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/live\/marketplace\/\">Xbox Live Marketplace<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Marketplace is a thing of genius. My son Patrick\u2019s favorite is the <a href=\"http:\/\/disney.go.com\/disneypictures\/cars\/\">Cars movie<\/a> trailer in HD. Being able to download demos is awesome, rather than keeping track of the discs that come with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.officialxboxmagazine.com\/\">OXM<\/a>. For example, I\u2019ve downloaded every racing game demo there is so Patrick can play them. He hasn\u2019t got the hang of it yet (he is only three) but since it\u2019s a demo it doesn\u2019t matter. He doesn\u2019t care that he keeps racing the same car on the same track. (He did see the new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/games\/c\/cars\">Cars game<\/a> at Blockbuster the other day, but it\u2019s for the original Xbox and not on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/games\/backwardcompatibilitygameslist.htm\">back compat<\/a> list.)<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the ability to play music and look at pictures from a standard XP machine is pretty cool. The User Experience for lots of photos and music isn\u2019t great, but the end result is worth it. My wife quipped \u201cI could watch this all night\u201d as we looked at a slide show of photos we\u2019ve taken over the past three years while listening to some of custom tunes. I don\u2019t have a Media Center as I\u2019ve been waiting for HD cable support. However, I know the MCE experience for navigating thousands of songs and photos is much better than Xbox 360\u2019s, so I might make the switch early. Plus, I would also get support for remote video viewing \u2013 something Xbox 360 doesn\u2019t support for reasons that escape me.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, I&#8217;m really digging the Xbox 360. Only downside is not enough time to play. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Last weekend, I finally got around to picking up an Xbox 360.
