But VS.NET doesn&#8217;t have any way to specify that multiple web services should all be in the same namespace.

And VS.NET 2003 support custom build steps so it&#8217;s pretty easy to execute WSDL.exe as part of a standard build. So it&#8217;s only a minor annoyance.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder if you could build your own custom Add Web Reference system via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsipdev.com\">VSIP<\/a>? Probably not worth the trouble.
