<p>While VS.NET&#8217;s whole &#8220;Add Web Reference&#8221; concept is cool, it utterly falls down in the face of multiple services exposed by the same back end. WSS exposes a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/spptsdk/html/soapnsMicrosoftSharePointSoapServer2.asp"> multitude of web services</a>. But VS.NET doesn&#8217;t have any way to specify that multiple web services should all be in the same namespace. So you end up each service in it&#8217;s own namespace like server1, server2, etc.</p>
<p>Luckily, WSDL.exe doesn&#8217;t have this problem. And VS.NET 2003 support custom build steps so it&#8217;s pretty easy to execute WSDL.exe as part of a standard build. So it&#8217;s only a minor annoyance.</p>
<p>I wonder if you could build your own custom Add Web Reference system via <a href="http://www.vsipdev.com">VSIP</a>? Probably not worth the trouble. But it does make me curious &#8211; is anyone looking at using VSIP on their shareware/freeware tool to integrate it more tightly into the VS.NET shell? I see <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/">Scott Hanselman</a> has a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/stories/2003/09/09/scottHanselmansUltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolsList.html"> great list of potentials</a>. (He even included my <a href="art_sccswitch.aspx">SccSwitch utility</a> &#8211; I&#8217;m honored!)</p>
