-   p&p have published new versions of both the [Web
    Service](http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory) and [Web
    Client](http://www.codeplex.com/websf) Software Factories. Beyond
    support for VS08, I’m not sure what’s new but that’s worth the price
    of download (admittedly close to zero) right there. I assume these
    need the most [recent release of the Guidance Automation
    Toolkit](http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/02/15/gax-gat-february-2008-final-release.aspx)
    as well.
-   W3C has published a [new working
    draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-sml-20080303/) of the [Service
    Modeling Language](http://www.w3.org/XML/SML/). I’m really
    interested to see where this technology goes.
-   Yesterday, Microsoft announced the [Silverlight Blueprint for
    Sharepoint](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/cc303301.aspx),
    part of a larger [Software + Services
    Blueprints](http://channel9.msdn.com/blueprints) initiative that I
    wasn’t aware of. [According to Michael
    Lehman](http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2008/02/11/software-plus-services-blueprints-for-vs2008-now-live.aspx)
    (who’s blog I’ve been been remiss to read of late), S+S Blueprints
    has a bunch of other interesting projects including
    [Video.Show](http://www.codeplex.com/videoshow) and
    [Outlook+Services](http://www.codeplex.com/ssblueprints/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=10627).

    [demonstrates](http://blogs.msdn.com/mmaly/archive/2008/02/29/building-a-dlr-language-answering-some-questions.aspx)
    how you can use DLR trees to build a statically typed add function.
    Literally, my very first thought after Martin [presented DLR Trees @
    Lang.NET](http://devhawk.net/2008/01/31/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx)
    was “I wonder if you could use that for static languages too?” I
    guess the answer is yes.
-   It’s been six months, and [Scott Hanselman still isn’t
    evil](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SixMonthsInTheInsideAmIEvilYet.aspx).
    Perhaps he could start turn his [ASP.NET wiki](http://wiki.asp.net/)
    into an evil ASP.NET wiki? Actually, I’m only linking to his post
    because I liked the way he described blogging as “I’m writing a book
    that will never end”.
