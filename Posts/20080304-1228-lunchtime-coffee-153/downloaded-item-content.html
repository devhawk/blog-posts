<li>p&amp;p have published new versions of both the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory">Web Service</a> and <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf">Web Client</a> Software Factories. Beyond support for VS08, I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s new but that&#8217;s worth the price of download (admittedly close to zero) right there. I assume these need the most <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/02/15/gax-gat-february-2008-final-release.aspx">recent release of the Guidance Automation Toolkit</a> as well.  </li>
<li>W3C has published a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-sml-20080303/">new working draft</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/SML/">Service Modeling Language</a>. I&#8217;m really interested to see where this technology goes.  </li>
<li>Yesterday, Microsoft announced the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/cc303301.aspx">Silverlight Blueprint for Sharepoint</a>, part of a larger <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/blueprints">Software + Services Blueprints</a> initiative that I wasn&#8217;t aware of. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2008/02/11/software-plus-services-blueprints-for-vs2008-now-live.aspx">According to Michael Lehman</a> (who&#8217;s blog I&#8217;ve been been remiss to read of late), S+S Blueprints has a bunch of other interesting projects including <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/videoshow">Video.Show</a> and <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ssblueprints/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=10627">Outlook+Services</a>.  </li>
<li>Martian Maly <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mmaly/archive/2008/02/29/building-a-dlr-language-answering-some-questions.aspx">demonstrates</a> how you can use DLR trees to build a statically typed add function. Literally, my very first thought after Martin <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/01/31/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx">presented DLR Trees @ Lang.NET</a> was &#8220;I wonder if you could use that for static languages too?&#8221; I guess the answer is yes.  </li>
<li>It&#8217;s been six months, and <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SixMonthsInTheInsideAmIEvilYet.aspx">Scott Hanselman still isn&#8217;t evil</a>. Perhaps he could start turn his <a href="http://wiki.asp.net/">ASP.NET wiki</a> into an <u>evil</u> ASP.NET wiki? Actually, I&#8217;m only linking to his post because I liked the way he described blogging as &#8220;I&#8217;m writing a book that will never end&#8221;.</li>
