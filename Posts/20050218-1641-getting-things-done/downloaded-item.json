It really struck a chord with me, in many ways because it&#8217;s seems like such a basic point. I would describe GTD as a way of dealing with the fact that our brains haven&#8217;t evolved to deal with the details of modern day life. Face it, our brains evolved in a time when our big concerns of the day were finding food and not getting eaten.\u00a0 It&#8217;s just not designed to keep the millions of picky little details that make up life today in order.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve only just started reading the book, but I&#8217;ve been trying to apply what I&#8217;ve learned.
