<p>A few weeks ago, I got a chance to see David Allen present his <a href="http://www.gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> methodology. It really struck a chord with me, in many ways because it&#8217;s seems like such a basic point. I would describe GTD as a way of dealing with the fact that our brains haven&#8217;t evolved to deal with the details of modern day life. Face it, our brains evolved in a time when our big concerns of the day were finding food and not getting eaten.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just not designed to keep the millions of picky little details that make up life today in order.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only just started reading the book, but I&#8217;ve been trying to apply what I&#8217;ve learned. I haven&#8217;t reached &#8220;Mind Like Water&#8221; yet, but I have knocked my inbox down from 400+ emails to 20. I&#8217;ve been taking it slowly &#8211; cleaning out all the new stuff plus 10-20 of the backlog every day. I&#8217;m doing it on my own &#8211; there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.gettingthingsdone.com/productDetail.php?id=63&IDoption=20">GTD addin for Outlook</a>, but I just hated it. One of the principles of GTD is to get the stuff out of your head and into a system that you trust. Frankly, when the GTD addin started hiding my email, I couldn&#8217;t trust it anymore. So instead, I do my own thing with Outlook &#8211; heavy on the task list of course. And so far so good.</p>
