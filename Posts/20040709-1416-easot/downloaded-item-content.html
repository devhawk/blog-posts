<p>We just published a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/entarch.asp">white paper</a> about the Enterprise Architectural Space Organizing Table. Basically, this is a table for categorizing architectural artifacts such as patterns. It owes a great deal to Zachman, but really builds out the concepts of roles and viewpoints.&nbsp;In addition to the white paper, you can get a PDF of <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/C/4/0C44F7EB-893F-4048-B2C6-C1C889E06DF1/MOAG_F02.pdf">the table itself</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s ultra-cool about this table is that it&#8217;s what the <a href="http://microsoft.com/practices">p&amp;p</a> group uses internally. The white paper maps <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx">every pattern MSFT has published</a> into the table. You can also see the EASOT viewpoints in action in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/intpatt-ch07.asp">Project Notebook</a>&nbsp;section of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/patterns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/intpatt.asp">Integration Patterns</a>. When I saw a print of the table hanging on the wall in p&amp;p&#8217;s building, I knew I wanted to see it published online. Love it or hate it, it&#8217;s real. </p>
<p>What do you think? Obviously, we&#8217;re planning on building on EASOT&nbsp;going forward. Is this useful? Valuable?&nbsp; </p>
