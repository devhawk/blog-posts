I realize yesterday I said I was on vacation starting today. In reality,
I’m not going to the office today, but I have time to post this before
my vacation starts in earnest.

-   I hit [Zero Email
    Bounce](http://www.shahine.com/omar/zeroemailbounce.aspx) in advance
    of my vacation. It’s been quite a while since the last time I got
    here and I hope to hit it much more often in the future.
-   The [DSL tools
    team](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718368.aspx)
    shipped a [Designer Integration
    PowerToy](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bfba74af-4f28-44cc-8de5-0c3c55d21863&displaylang=en) that
    allows you to integrate models from multiple DSL designers into a
    single authoring tool. Gareth has [more
    here](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2007/02/16/announcing-designer-integration-powertoy.aspx).
-   Assorted PowerShell links: [PowerShell
    Analyzer](http://www.powershellanalyzer.com/) and
    [PowerShellIDE](http://www.powershell.com/). Both look interesting.
-   Personally, I like
    [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) but apparently
    the only way to add a new syntax highlight scheme requires modifying
    the source code. Ugh. Anyone out there already added PS support to
    Notepad2? How about a suggestion for a simple text editor that
    supports extensible syntax highlighting?

    [Nick](http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/02/08/durable-is-more-than-duplex.aspx)
    and
    [Tomas](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/02/07/LongRunningServicesAndWSRM.aspx)
    all commented on my [long running services WCF
    post](http://devhawk.net/2007/02/06/How+I+Learned+To+Stop+Worrying+And+Love+WCF.aspx).
    Tomas mentions Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) which looks
    to be developing an open spec queuing system like MSMQ or MQ series.
    Interesting, but given the lack of involvement of the major MQ and
    DB vendors, I’m hard pressed to imagine this gaining any kind of
    critical mass.
