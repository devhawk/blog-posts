Tomas mentions Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) which looks to be developing an open spec queuing system like MSMQ or MQ series. Interesting, but given the lack of involvement of the major MQ and DB vendors, I&#8217;m hard pressed to imagine this gaining any kind of critical mass.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I realize yesterday I said I was on vacation starting today.
