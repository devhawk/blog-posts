<p>After using the new 2.1 firmware for my Nomad Zen Micro for a couple of days, I can see why they haven&#8217;t upgraded all their players en masse quite yet. It still has a few rough edges. <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/">Red Chair Software</a>, makers of the awesome <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/">Notmad Explorer</a> that I use to manage my other Nomads, advises that you use the older 1.x firmware &#8220;you have a specific reason to switch&#8221;. Of course, I have a <a href="http://www.napster.com/ntg.html">very good reason to switch</a>. The 2.1 firmware is actually beta &#8211; something I think Creative should make a little more obvious on the website (not that I wouldn&#8217;t have downloaded it anyway). For the less adventurous, the 2.0 firmware also supports Napster to Go and isn&#8217;t in beta.</p>
<p>The place where I notice the rough edge the most during song transition. When I push next or previous song, sometimes it happens right away and sometimes it takes 4-5 seconds. It doesn&#8217;t happen when it&#8217;s playing back a set of songs &#8211; what ever the Nomad is doing (verifying licenses I&#8217;m assume) it must do it for the next song before the current song ends, so the lag only occurs when you&#8217;re jumping around manually.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s really my biggest complaint. Napster to Go works really well. They haven&#8217;t upgraded their help files to the new 3.x version of Napster &#8211; for example, all of their screenshots have a separate library function within Napster, but on my machine it just uses WMP&#8217;s library &#8211; but it&#8217;s pretty easy to figure out. I&#8217;ve configured NTG and WMP 10 to auto sync any Zen Micro with any songs I&#8217;ve downloaded from Napster (about 1GB in the first 24 hours I&#8217;ve used it!). The only complaint there is that autosync works by playlist. If you download a Napster compilation, autosync will transfer the music but not the playlist. </p>
<p>And that reminds me of a feature I&#8217;d like to see on the Nomad (all of them). I want to be able filter the list of album to exclude the ones that only have one or two songs. When you download a compilation, you get around 25 songs from different artists. Great for discovering new music, but it adds a bunch of noise to the list of albums. So why not exclude albums that only have a few songs downloaded?</p>
