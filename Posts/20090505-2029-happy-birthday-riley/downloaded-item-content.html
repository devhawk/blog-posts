She was born on 5-5-05 (at 5:25pm no less!). </p>
<p><a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/">Jules</a> and I were picking out pictures for Riley&#8217;s &#8220;birthday ribbon&#8221; and we came across this one from her birthday party weekend before last. We had it a week early because my mother-in-law had surgery on her foot last week. It was a girls-only princess tea party, so I didn&#8217;t get to see her chasing bubbles in person. I loved this picture, but we ended up using one where you could see her face better. Still, I thought it was just too good not to share.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday big girl!</p>
