I have blogged about the NHL work stoppage several times - I imagine
it’s pretty obvious that I place the blame for the cancellation of the
season firmly on the shoulders of the NHL players association. I find it
interesting that Gary open his comments today with an apology to the
fans while NHLPA exec director Bob Goodenow opened his comments today by
slamming the league. In fact, when asked if the NHLPA owes the fans an
apology, this was Bob’s
[response](http://www.nhlpa.com/Content/Feature.asp?contentId=3428):

I guess the NHLPA doesn’t believe they owe me – the fan – an
apology. Here’s my response to Bob’s response:

> Fuck you, Bob.

If Bob really believes that the player’s proposal would have made the
league successful, how come they didn’t accept the league’s [offer last
week](http://www.nhlcbanews.com/news/nhl_compromise020905.html) to try
it the player’s way, but have a system in place to enforce cost
certainty if it didn’t work? I’m guessing it’s because no matter how
many times the Bob refers to one of his proposals as “groundbreaking”
than nobody – including Bob – really believes that the 24% rollback
would do anything to stem the skyrocketing salaries in the long run. Bob
had the nerve to say in his statement today that “During the last CBA,
when revenues went up, so did salaries. When revenues eased, so did
salaries. As evidenced by recent signings.” What a load of bullshit.
When revenue growth dropped to around 5% year over year in 01/02 &
02/03, salary growth ballooned to almost 12%. And as for “evidenced by
recent signings”, I guess Bob is just going to gloss over the fact that
reason that salaries has eased recently is only because so many players
went unsigned last summer since all the teams realized the lockout was
looming.

Well I guess if I need a hockey fix, my only choice is catching a

[Thunderbirds](http://www.seattle-thunderbirds.com/) game.
