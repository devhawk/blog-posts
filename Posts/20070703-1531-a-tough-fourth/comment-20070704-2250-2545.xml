  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Okay, I just re-read your thread and I can't figure out why you haven't already moved to the Peoples Republic of Canada.  You have seemed to forget that Congress' approval rating of 29% (http://www.galluppoll.com/content/?ci=27589).  This rating is with your so called 'landslide Democratic victory'...

As for the upcoming elections, I am sure that without a miracle Hillary will become President.  I can only imagine the horror of having Pelosi and Clinton running this country.  Get ready to pay for amnesty, socialized health care, and whatever else Hillary wants to push through while she is in power.
