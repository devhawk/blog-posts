  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well interesting that you point out how corrupt the Republicans are, and grap comfort in the Democratic party.  Perhaps you should review the 400+ pardons that Clinton granted before he left office (http://www.usdoj.gov/pardon/clintonpardon_grants.htm).  I found it especially interesting that one of the pardons was for someone who was convicted of Bank Robbery (Charles Patrick Murrin C. D. Calif. 1988 Bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a)).

As for Scooter Libby, remember that he was convicted for "not remembering something", not bank robbery.  Perhaps the hipocracy is just a little too thick...]]></wp:comment_content>
