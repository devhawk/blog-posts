<p>As Americans prepare to celebrate the birth of our nation tomorrow, what is arguably the most corrupt administration in a generation &#8211; certainly the most corrupt administration that I can remember by far (I was four when Nixon left office) &#8211; has provided yet another stark reminder of&nbsp;just how unfathomably corrupt it is by <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19570081/">commuting Scooter Libby&#8217;s prison sentence</a> within hours of Libby losing&nbsp;the appeal to remain&nbsp;free while the original guilty verdict is appealed. It&#8217;s not a full pardon, but I would expect <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19583008/">that&#8217;s coming</a> sooner or later. </p>
<p>True patriots like myself will have a hard time celebrating America tomorrow. But I will, because America is bigger than this&nbsp;festering administration and the damage it has wrought to our safety and our reputation. I take solace in the landslide Democratic victory last November and&nbsp;the <a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/434/trends-in-political-values-and-core-attitudes-1987-2007">long-term negative effect</a> this rouge lawless president and his <a href="http://www.pollster.com/blogs/bush_approval_cbs_27_trend_at.php">freefall approval ratings</a> is having on the Republican party.</p>
<p>As far as I&#8217;m concerned, <a href="http://www.bushslastday.com/">Jan. 20th, 2009</a> can&#8217;t come soon enough.</p>
