As Americans prepare to celebrate the birth of our nation tomorrow, what
is arguably the most corrupt administration in a generation – certainly
the most corrupt administration that I can remember by far (I was four
when Nixon left office) – has provided yet another stark reminder
of just how unfathomably corrupt it is by [commuting Scooter Libby’s
prison sentence](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19570081/) within hours of
Libby losing the appeal to remain free while the original guilty verdict
is appealed. It’s not a full pardon, but I would expect [that’s
coming](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19583008/) sooner or later.

True patriots like myself will have a hard time celebrating America
tomorrow. But I will, because America is bigger than this festering
administration and the damage it has wrought to our safety and our
reputation. I take solace in the landslide Democratic victory last
November and the [long-term negative
effect](http://pewresearch.org/pubs/434/trends-in-political-values-and-core-attitudes-1987-2007)
this rouge lawless president and his [freefall approval
ratings](http://www.pollster.com/blogs/bush_approval_cbs_27_trend_at.php)
is having on the Republican party.

As far as I’m concerned, [Jan. 20th, 2009](http://www.bushslastday.com/)
can’t come soon enough.
