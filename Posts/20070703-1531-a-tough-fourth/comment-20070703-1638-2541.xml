  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Just to be clear...you were ok with Clinton pardoning his Whitewater friends, right? Yeah, that's what I thought. Another fucking politcal hack who only wraps himself in the flag when his fucking party is out of power.

It's ok when the Dems do it, but if Republicans do it then suddenly you weep for your country. How fucking sick.

Be a real patriot and criticize corruption and wrongdoing regardless of the political affiliation. ]]></wp:comment_content>
