<li>Big news yesterday was Microsoft announcing &#8220;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-21ExpandInteroperabilityPR.mspx">Strategic Changes in Technology and Business Practices to Expand Interoperability</a>&#8220;. More details available at the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/">Interoperability website</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2008/feb08/02-21Muglia.mspx">this interview</a> with Bob Muglia.  </li>
<li>The videos from Lang.NET 2008 are <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/talks.asp">now available</a>, including <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/talks/3-03%20-%20Parsing%20Expression%20Grammars%20in%20FSharp%20-%20Harry%20Pierson.html">mine</a>.  </li>
<li>Mix08 is just under two weeks away, and the news is ramping up. Scott Guthrie provides a &#8220;<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/22/first-look-at-silverlight-2.aspx">first look</a>&#8221; at the Silverlight 2.0 beta (aka the one with .NET) that will release @ Mix. He also provides a set of eight tutorials where he demonstrates building a Digg client for Silverlight 2.0. I&#8217;ve been doing a little Silverlight 1.0 experimentation recently, but I think I&#8217;m going to scrap it in favor of waiting for 2.0.  </li>
<li>Shorter Nick Malik: IoC is cool, but isn&#8217;t a silver bullet. Go read the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2008/02/15/what-is-the-tradeoff-with-inversion-of-control-ioc.aspx">whole</a> thing.  </li>
<li>Brad Wilson has a <a href="http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2008/02/dell-xps-m1330.html">new laptop with a solid-state hard drive</a>. VS08 installs in under 10 minutes? I gotta get me one of those&#8230; </li>
<li>In addition to the XNA news, Microsoft also <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/02/20/GDC08Portfolio.aspx">announced</a><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/gearsofwar2">Gears of War 2</a>, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/fable2/">Fable 2</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/ninjagaiden2/">Ninja Gaiden II</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/toohuman">Too Human</a> will all be available this year exclusively on Xbox 360. Of those, I&#8217;m most interested in Fable 2, though Too Human is looking interesting. But what about <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/halowars/">Halo Wars</a>? When is that shipping?</li>
