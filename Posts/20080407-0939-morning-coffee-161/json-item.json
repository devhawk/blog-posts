This RoR plugin lets you declaratively specify if you want your RoR controller code to be accessed remotely via AJAX and run on the server or if you want that code to be downloaded to the client and run in SilverLight.

There&#8217;s going to be an update to the &#8220;Research release&#8221; later this month and a CTP of the &#8220;Product release&#8221; later this summer (Brian McNamara has the <a href=\"http:\/\/lorgonblog.spaces.live.com\/blog\/cns!701679AD17B6D310!160.entry\">CTP details<\/a>). I am looking forward to these releases, though I&#8217;ll probably be too busy w\/ IPy to experiment much with them. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of F#, Matt Podwysocki continues his adventures with F# with a look at tuples, records and discriminated unions. Of the three, I find discriminated unions the most interesting since there isn&#8217;t anything like it in other languages I&#8217;ve used. <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/agile\/archive\/2008\/04\/04\/unity-di-container-1-0-shipped.aspx\">Gregori<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tavaresstudios.com\/Blog\/post.aspx?id=f3b5c7a9-feb5-4695-b5f3-1b70b0b87719\">Chris<\/a> both announce the release of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/Release\/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=unity&amp;ReleaseId=12276\">Unity 1.0<\/a>. Congrats guys! But if I don&#8217;t have time to hack around with the latest F# release, you can imagine I won&#8217;t be getting to Unity any time soon&#8230; <\/li>\n<li>Jeff Atwood <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codinghorror.com\/blog\/archives\/001091.html\">recommends<\/a> you build your application UI first. Furthermore, he does a good job selling the value of paper prototyping as well as introducing the concept of PowerPoint prototyping. Money quote: &#8220;You don&#8217;t want something too powerful.&#8221; <\/li>\n<li>Via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.liveside.net\/blogs\/opinion\/archive\/2008\/04\/07\/perspectives-james-hamilton-on-containers-condos-and-the-cloud.aspx\">LiveSide<\/a> I discovered <a href=\"http:\/\/perspectives.mvdirona.com\/default.aspx\">James Hamilton&#8217;s blog<\/a>. Normally, hardware infrastructure isn&#8217;t really my bag, but I find his ideas around <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/~JamesRH\/TalksAndPapers\/JamesRH_CIDR.doc\">using ISO standard shipping containers as modular data center building blocks<\/a> fascinating. For example, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/perspectives.mvdirona.com\/2008\/04\/06\/DiseconomiesOfScale.aspx\">this post<\/a> that suggests sticking modular data centers in condos would be cheaper than building data centers!<a href=\"http:\/\/perspectives.mvdirona.com\/SyndicationService.asmx\/GetRss\">Subscribed<\/a>. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of ISO, you may have heard Open Office XML was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/press\/2008\/apr08\/04-01OpenXMLVotePR.mspx\">ratified as an ISO standard<\/a>. Obviously, there was a lot of controversy around this, but Miguel de Icaza lists of what he considers <a href=\"http:\/\/tirania.org\/blog\/archive\/2008\/Apr-02.html\">major community wins<\/a> from the standardization process. Anything that &#8220;pushed Microsoft into more open directions&#8221; is a good thing IMO. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Huge perk of the new job: new hardware.
