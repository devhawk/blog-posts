-   Huge perk of the new job: new hardware. I had to give up my Dell
    workstation but I got a [Lenovo T61p dual core widescreen
    laptop](http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&current-category-id=1F106632CBC24D2CBD23DF19644D3694),
    an [HP dc7800 dual monitor quad core
    desktop](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/en/WF25a/12454-12454-64287-321860-3328898-3459240.html)
    and a [Polycom CX700 IP
    phone](http://www.polycom.com/usa/en/products/voice/desktop/cx/communicator_cx700.html).
    I’m really digging the Lenovo’s integrated fingerprint reader – no
    more password login – but I’m most impressed with their [integrated
    driver management
    software](http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=TVSU-UPDATE).
    Sure beats the heck out of hunting for dozens of updated drivers all
    over the place like most vendors for you to.
-   Minor downside to all my new toys: I spent most of my first week on
    the job installing and configuring said new toys.
-   Caps will face the Flyers in the first round of the playoffs which
    [starts
    Friday](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/capitalsinsider/2008/04/playoff_schedule.html).
    I have a feeling that I’ll be feeling poorly Friday around 3pm and
    have to head home early.

-   Apparently, Michael Foord isn’t getting enough exposure on this
    blog.
    ![:)](http://devhawk.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
    [He left a
    comment](http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,7d25906b-cd4d-409c-aeeb-e7455c6260aa.aspx#commentstart)
    to remind me to mention the [IronPython URLs link
    blog](http://ironpython-urls.blogspot.com/) he writes along with
    Mark Rees and Seo Sanghyeon.
-   Speaking of Michael, his employer Resolver Systems just launched a
    new product: [Resolver One
    Quant](http://www.resolversystems.com/products/resolver-one-quant.php).
-   Still speaking of Michael, he’s quoted in the InternetNews article
    [Python Fans Take Aim at the
    Enterprise](http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3738856%20).
-   My teammate Jimmy Schementi [posts a
    preview](http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/2008/04/silverlight-on-rails.html)
    of his spare time project “Silverlight on Rails”. This RoR plugin
    lets you declaratively specify if you want your RoR controller code
    to be accessed remotely via AJAX and run on the server or if you
    want that code to be downloaded to the client and run in
    SilverLight. Very cool stuff.

Other Stuff

-   Don Syme provides [some
    insight](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/04/04/tackling-the-f-productization.aspx)
    into the F\# producization process. There’s going to be an update to
    the “Research release” later this month and a CTP of the “Product
    release” later this summer (Brian McNamara has the [CTP
    details](http://lorgonblog.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!701679AD17B6D310!160.entry)).
    I am looking forward to these releases, though I’ll probably be too
    busy w/ IPy to experiment much with them.
-   Speaking of F\#, Matt Podwysocki continues his adventures with F\#
    with a look at tuples, records and discriminated unions. Of the
    three, I find discriminated unions the most interesting since there
    isn’t anything like it in other languages I’ve used.
-   [Gregori](http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/04/04/unity-di-container-1-0-shipped.aspx)
    and
    [Chris](http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/post.aspx?id=f3b5c7a9-feb5-4695-b5f3-1b70b0b87719)
    both announce the release of [Unity
    1.0](http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=unity&ReleaseId=12276).
    Congrats guys! But if I don’t have time to hack around with the
    latest F\# release, you can imagine I won’t be getting to Unity any
    time soon…

    [recommends](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001091.html)
    you build your application UI first. Furthermore, he does a good job
    selling the value of paper prototyping as well as introducing the
    concept of PowerPoint prototyping. Money quote: “You don’t want
    something too powerful.”

    [LiveSide](http://www.liveside.net/blogs/opinion/archive/2008/04/07/perspectives-james-hamilton-on-containers-condos-and-the-cloud.aspx)
    I discovered [James Hamilton’s
    blog](http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/default.aspx). Normally,
    hardware infrastructure isn’t really my bag, but I find his ideas
    around [using ISO standard shipping containers as modular data
    center building
    blocks](http://research.microsoft.com/~JamesRH/TalksAndPapers/JamesRH_CIDR.doc)
    fascinating. For example, check out [this
    post](http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2008/04/06/DiseconomiesOfScale.aspx)
    that suggests sticking modular data centers in condos would be
    cheaper than building data
    centers![Subscribed](http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/SyndicationService.asmx/GetRss).
-   Speaking of ISO, you may have heard Open Office XML was [ratified as
    an ISO
    standard](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/apr08/04-01OpenXMLVotePR.mspx).
    Obviously, there was a lot of controversy around this, but Miguel de
    Icaza lists of what he considers [major community
    wins](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/Apr-02.html) from the
    standardization process. Anything that “pushed Microsoft into more
    open directions” is a good thing IMO.
