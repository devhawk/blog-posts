Napster is wholy inconsistent when it comes to tagging their music. For example, I downloaded Denis Leary&#8217;s Merry F&#8217;n Christmas album, but half the songs are tagged that they come from the Merry F#%$in&#8217; Christmas album. This specific example only appears to be an issue in WMP, but I also had issues with the tagging of Chris Rock&#8217;s Never Scared album. One song shows up as part of the &#8220;Never Scared&#8221; album, but the rest show up as &#8220;Never Scared [Bonus DVD]&#8220;. <\/p>\n<p>I think WMP adds to the difficulty here because of the sheer amount of metadata it tracks. Artist and Album Artist for example. Good idea, but it&#8217;s really easy for those to get out of sync (check out this <a href=\"http:\/\/msmvps.com\/thinice\/articles\/15229.aspx\">website<\/a> for more info on that). And because these files are all DRM protected, you can&#8217;t edit the metadata in the file itself, only in WMP&#8217;s library. But I can&#8217;t figure out how the metadata &amp; file structure on my computer corrisponds to metadata structure on the Nomad with 100% certanty. <\/p>\n<p>However, even with that, I still recommend Napster to Go highly. This is a very minor issue that I think highlights a few of the remaining rough edges in a consumer scenario that involved Microsoft, Napster and the media player manufacturer. Plus, I&#8217;m anal about things like album names.<\/p>\n<p>(One other side note &#8211; deleteing and rebuilding your WMP library causes all the songs on the device to be retransfered. Woops. Had to reformat the device, but since there&#8217;s nothing on it but my Napster music, it was no big deal.)<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;ve discovered one thing about my Nomad\/Napster To Go\/WMP combo that I don&#8217;t like.
