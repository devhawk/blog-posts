<p>I'm quoted in <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,4248,1128705,00.asp"> Microsoft Watch</a>, <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=5dbc986e-628a-4071-9bc5-b02e51497a1b"> again</a>. This time it's about my <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=7f8bdbae-4eb2-43de-ba52-513b7b5d3f0d">disclaimer</a>.</p><p>I don't quite get all the hullabaloo about a potential corporate blogging policy. I meet with customers every day and usually I am privy to information that I can't share. My boss, the product groups and Microsoft in general trusts my judgment about the handling of this information, otherwise I wouldn't have a job here. I'm sure there's a policy for what I should and shouldn't say to a customer. This blog is no different. I don't talk about stuff I can't talk about going on inside the big house. I do offer my opinion on topics that interest me such as web services, <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=1e7d894f-0457-4a23-b85d-46aa48a8a2ce">programming language innovation</a> and the use of <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=7d4b2a20-5cf8-423a-b71e-3f2a305f4ba8">XML vs. Objects</a>. Some topics, such as <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=3d584471-6872-4486-b680-6545cc477867">my opinion</a> on the recent deal between <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/index.asp">SourceGear</a> and the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono project</a>, might be considered sensitive subjects. I put the disclaimer in order to make sure there's no mistake about what is my opinion and what is "official" Microsoft messaging.</p><p>I've never been at a company where the employees are more empowered (and valued) than Microsoft. I have a hard time imaging that Microsoft would issue some heavy-handed policy that effectively neuters employee blogs. </p>
