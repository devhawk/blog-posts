<p>I know I'm on vacation, but I had to blog this. The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj3intro.asp">third issue</a> of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal/default.aspx">Architects JOURNAL</a> is online. The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/softwarefactories/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj3softfac.asp">first article</a> from J3 is about Software Factories. It's is the first of a four part series. You can check out the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/softwarefactories/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/softwarefactwo.asp">second article in the series</a> from our brand new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/softwarefactories/">Software Factories page</a> on Architecture Center. </p><p>Update - My pal Chris (who is blogless at this point) pointed out <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1633430,00.asp">an article in eWeek</a> on Software Factories.</p>
