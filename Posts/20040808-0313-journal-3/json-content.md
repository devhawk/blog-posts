I know I’m on vacation, but I had to blog this. The [third
issue](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj3intro.asp)
of [Architects
JOURNAL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal/default.aspx) is
online. The [first
article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/softwarefactories/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj3softfac.asp)
from J3 is about Software Factories. It’s is the first of a four part
series. You can check out the [second article in the
series](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/softwarefactories/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/softwarefactwo.asp)
from our brand new [Software Factories
page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/softwarefactories/)
on Architecture Center.

Update – My pal Chris (who is blogless at this point) pointed out [an
article in eWeek](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1633430,00.asp)
on Software Factories.
