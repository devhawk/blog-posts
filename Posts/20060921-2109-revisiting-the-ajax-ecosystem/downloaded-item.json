Old school VB, COM\/ActiveX and .NET have all had large ecosystems of components and controls evolve that extend the functionality of the baseline development platform. There&#8217;s no reason to believe that won&#8217;t happen with Atlas. I think it&#8217;s wrong to describe Atlas as a monolith or self-contained or enclosing. It&#8217;s an extensible baseline platform &#8211; i.e. the baseline functionality is set down once at the development platform and the ecosystem can extend it from there. Sure, overlapping extensions happen (how many rich text editor components are there for ASP.NET?) but at least they all have basic compatibility.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I bring this up now because I saw on <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/sburke\/archive\/2006\/09\/19\/762781.aspx\">Shawn Burke&#8217;s blog<\/a> that they&#8217;ve shipped the September release of the <a href=\"http:\/\/atlas.asp.net\/atlastoolkit\/\">Atlas Control Toolkit<\/a>.
