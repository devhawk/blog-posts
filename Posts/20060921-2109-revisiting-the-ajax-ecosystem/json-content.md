Seven months and one job ago, I [wrote
this](http://devhawk.net/2006/02/14/Thoughts+On+The+AJAX+Toolkit+Spectrum.aspx)
about AJAX toolkits:

I bring this up now because I saw on [Shawn Burke’s
blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2006/09/19/762781.aspx) that
they’ve shipped the September release of the [Atlas Control
Toolkit](http://atlas.asp.net/atlastoolkit/). There are now 25 different
controls (they had 10 in their first release). But there’s something
more significant than the addition of 15 controls overall:

I just wanted to brag that I called this 7 months ago.
