Does anyone implement search on their blogs? The .NET
[weblog](http://www.simplegeek.com)[systems](http://www.aspnetweblog.com)
I have seen don’t, neither does Radio. But [Sam
Ruby’s](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/) does. I would think that
search would be a useful feature. Is it? If not, why not?
