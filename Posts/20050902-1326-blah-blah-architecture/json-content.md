If you heard [my PDC05
Buzzcast](http://devhawk.net/2005/09/01/PDC05+Architecture+Symposium+Buzzcast.aspx)
but just can’t get enough of my voice, check out [Architect MVP Mario
Cardinal](http://www.mariocardinal.com/)‘s [Blah Blah Architecture
podcast](http://www.mariocardinal.com/podcast). I spent [some time with
Mario at TechEd](http://www.mariocardinal.com/podcast/Show/0003.html)
talking about the [Architecture Resource
Center](http://microsoft.com/architecture), why we designed it the way
we did, why we have a site on
[MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture) and MS.com, how are
taxonomy works, etc. Mario then takes my basic explanation and helps
fill in more of the details, such as the relevance of the Architecture
Resource Center to folks not using Microsoft technology. We also talked
about [Architecture
Journal](http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=journal)
as well as why Microsoft invests in architecture.

BTW, I make some of the same points about architecture – as it differs
from engineering, that it’s the space between business and technology,
and the effect of title inflation – that I’ve made here on this blog
this past week.

I guess I need some new material.
