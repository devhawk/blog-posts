<ul><li>Doing these morning coffee posts is a lot tougher since I cut back my blog reading. Where I used to have no trouble finding 4-5 coffee-worthy items every day, these days I seem to only get 1-2, if that. </li><li>After starting off 3-0 and 100% on the PK, the Caps dropped four in a row and have been miserable on special teams. The special teams woes continued <a href="http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20072008/GS020126.HTM" target="_blank">last night against the Lightning</a>, but they still won. Caps went 0-4 on the powerplay, and coughed up a short handed goal. But they also went 3-3 on the PK, so I guess it wasn't all bad. Maybe my mother will stop calling for Hanlon's job now. It's a long season and as Peerless Prognosticator points out, <a href="http://peerlessprognosticator.blogspot.com/2007/10/rebuild-is-not-over.html" target="_blank">the rebuild isn't over</a>. </li><li>Jomo Fisher, who helped Scott Hanselman <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MixingLanguagesInASingleAssemblyInVisualStudioSeamlesslyWithILMergeAndMSBuild.aspx" target="_blank">auto-merge assemblies</a>, has been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jomo_fisher/archive/tags/F_2300_/default.aspx" target="_blank">digging around in F#</a> of late. As it turns out, he's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/17/s-somasegar-on-taking-f-forward.aspx" target="_blank">joining the F# team</a> so I'm thinking it's not a huge stretch for him. If you're a C# developer trying interested in getting a handle on this new F# thing, his blog is a good place to start. </li><li>Speaking of F#, Don Syme posts about yet another new F# feature: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/11/introducing-f-asynchronous-workflows.aspx" target="_blank">Async Workflows</a>. Workflow is a bad term here IMO since it can be easily confused with <a href="http://wf.netfx3.com/" target="_blank">WF</a>. Regardless of it's name, Async Workflows is about making <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228969.aspx" target="_blank">.NET's Async Programming model</a> a first class citizen in F#. Robert Pickering has a good post <a href="http://strangelights.com/blog/archive/2007/10/15/1599.aspx" target="_blank">explaining</a> how this new feature works. </li><li>Microsoft sure has a lot of multi-threading / async-programming tools coming out. In addition to F# Async Workflows, there's the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb905422.aspx" target="_blank">Concurrency and Coordination Runtime</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/10/PLINQ/default.aspx" target="_blank">Parallel LINQ</a> and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/10/Futures/default.aspx" target="_blank">Task Parallel Library</a>. I would hope all this work eventually coalesces as a coherent product offering.  </li><li>Now that F# is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/17/f-a-functional-programming-language.aspx" target="_blank">being "producized"</a>, I wonder if the language evolution will slow down. Async workflows were introduced in F# 1.9.2.9. Other recent changes include <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/09/22/some-details-on-f-computation-expressions-aka-monadic-or-workflow-syntax.aspx" target="_blank">Computation Expressions</a> (v1.9.2), <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/08/01/introducing-use-bindings-in-f-1-9-2.aspx" target="_blank">Use Bindings</a> (v1.9.2) and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/04/07/draft-paper-on-f-active-patterns.aspx" target="_blank">Active Patterns</a> (v1.9.1). F# seems to churn more in minor releases than C# does in major releases. Of course, that's because F# was a research project, not a "real" product. Now that it's going to be a product, will the rate of innovation slow?</li></ul>
