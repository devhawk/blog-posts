[Everyone](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx#nn2003-04-06T06:17:09Z)[seems](http://aspnetweblog.com/posts/4942.aspx)
to
[agree](http://www.ingorammer.com/Weblog/default.aspx?day=2003-04-06#20030406193000)
with [Chris](http://objective.mine.nu/index.aspx). Me too. Wow, the
threaded view is awesome. And it has filtering too, but not quite what I
was [looking
for](http://devhawk.net/2003/04/06/aggregating-rss-revisited/). Like
[Brad](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/002865.shtml), I’d
throw money at SharpReader. Looks like I’ll need to add support for the
[image RSS
tag](http://backend.userland.com/rss#optionalChannelElements), since
SharpReader will show it.
