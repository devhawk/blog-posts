<p>I got a couple of emails yesterday at my <a href="mailto:hpierson at microsoft dot com">work address</a> that my blog was down. Turns out there&#8217;s this <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4071687/">big winter storm</a> battering the east coast. My blog is hosted on the east coast and&nbsp;they lost power for a while. No power == no blog. But if you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;ve probably already figured out that the power is back on and my blog is back up.</p>
