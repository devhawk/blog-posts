I got a couple of emails yesterday at my [work
address](mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com) that my blog was
down. Turns out there’s this [big winter
storm](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4071687/) battering the east coast.
My blog is hosted on the east coast and they lost power for a while. No
power == no blog. But if you’re reading this, you’ve probably already
figured out that the power is back on and my blog is back up.
