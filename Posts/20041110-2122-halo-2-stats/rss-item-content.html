This really brings the online experience to a new level. It's so cool, that I had to create a new flair for my blog linking to <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/PlayerStats.aspx?player=RayTracer">my stats page</a> (I also put up a link to my games <a href="http://www.bungie.net/stats/halo2rss.ashx?i=58981&amp;k=13126510">RSS feed</a>). Granted, my stats so far are pretty lame - I've only played one multiplayer game so far and I came in 5th. (I did spend most of last night playing the campain.) Maybe the public nature of the stats will drive me to improve them. I haven't joined a clan yet, but when I do I'll create a flair for that too.</p><p>The coolest thing about this is that it sets a new bar for online experience. <a href="http://leagues.espnvideogames.com/">ESPN Video Games</a> and <a href="http://www.easports.com/online/home.jsp">EA Sports</a> are nowhere near this level of detail, but I imagine they are taking notice.</p>
