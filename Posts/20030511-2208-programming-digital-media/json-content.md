While everyone else is thinking about [RSS
Profiles](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/#nn2003-05-11T03:20:30Z)
(which I will be updating [WSS RSS](prj_sharepointsynd.aspx) to
support), I’m thinking about digital media. Not very XML-esque of me, I
know, but the more I read of [Sean’s
blog](http://erablog.net/blogs/sean), the more interested I get. I’m
still working on my [Media Center
Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.asp) PC.
(a few weeks ago [I
posted](http://devhawk.net/2003/04/19/media-center/) a link
to an article on [programming the MCE
remote](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwmt/html/remote_control.asp)).
I just ordered [Programming Microsoft DirectShow for Digital Video and
Television](http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/6381.asp) – looks
cool. I just started reading about the [DirectShow Editing
Services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/directx/htm/directshoweditingservicescreference.asp?frame=true)
and I want to read “[Creating Custom Effects and Transitions in Windows
Movie
Maker](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwmt/html/moviemakersfx.asp)“.
Of course, DirectShow is the only part of DirectX 9 that isn’t
programmable via [Managed
DirectX](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_m/directx/directx9m.asp?frame=true),
which means either a) use C++ or b) write lots of P/Invokes.
