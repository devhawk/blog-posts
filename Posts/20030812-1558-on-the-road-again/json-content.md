I’ll be on vacation the next two days, but here’s a quick post before I
go.

As I’m sure has been widely reported, WS-I [Basic Profile
1.0](http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/Basic/2003-08/BasicProfile-1.0.htm)
shipped today. But sheer lack-of-coincidence, MSFT shipped the latest
[P&P](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/): [Building
Interoperable Web
Services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnsvcinter/html/WSI-BP_MSDN_LandingPage.asp).
No time to read it now, but I’ll check it out next week and report back.
