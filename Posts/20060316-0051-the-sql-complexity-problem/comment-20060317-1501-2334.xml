  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, it seems you've just discovered the language impedence mismatch (between databases and programming) C#3 is all about?
Solutions of diverse kinds have been around for some time, and a some interest into the Java community would help you grasp the ideas...
Have a look at db4objects and see for yourself!

To me, and to the knowledge I have so far with C#3 and LINQ, these are just going back to the goo' ol' days of Visual FoxPro and embedded SQL. If its true, then it's a backwards step. Forward step is, as you reckon, into direct object graphs persistence.

Cheers,
