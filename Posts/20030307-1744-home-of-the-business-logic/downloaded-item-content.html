<blockquote><p>And no, this story isn&#8217;t made up. Let me just quote one of the folks at this conference: <em>&#8220;I truly believe that most of this world&#8217;s business logic is implemented in Excel&#8221;.</em> [<a href="http://www.ingorammer.com/Weblog/default.aspx?day=2003-03-07#20030307225900">Ingo Rammer's DotNetCentric</a>] </p>

<p>According to my friends at <a href="http://www.fsw.fujitsu.com/">Fujitsu Software Corporation</a>, 70% of the worlds business logic is still in <a href="http://www.cobolportal.com/">COBOL</a>. Of course, with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnofftalk/html/office12092002.asp"> Visual Studio Tools for Office</a> and Fujitsu&#8217;s <a href="http://www.netcobol.com/dotnet/index.html">NetCOBOL for .NET</a>, you could conceivably migrate the COBOL code directly into Excel. And no, I&#8217;m not making this up either! <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_wink.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group39" alt=";)"> </p>
