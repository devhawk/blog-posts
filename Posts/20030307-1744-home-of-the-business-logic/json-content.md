According to my friends at [Fujitsu Software
Corporation](http://www.fsw.fujitsu.com/), 70% of the worlds business
logic is still in [COBOL](http://www.cobolportal.com/). Of course, with
[Visual Studio Tools for
Office](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnofftalk/html/office12092002.asp)
and Fujitsu’s [NetCOBOL for
.NET](http://www.netcobol.com/dotnet/index.html), you could conceivably
migrate the COBOL code directly into Excel. And no, I’m not making this
up either!
