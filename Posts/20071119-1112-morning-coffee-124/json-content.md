-   While my blog was down last week, I finally finished [Gears of
    War](http://www.xbox.com/games/gearsofwar/). I played thru on
    hardcore, but had to throttle back to casual to beat the last boss.
    I’d like to try and finish on hardcore, but I’ve moved on to [Dead
    Rising](http://www.xbox.com/games/deadrising/) – another game from
    last year I never had time to finish. I’m almost done the main play
    mode, though I understand there are other play modes that get
    unlocked when you finish it.
-   I’m forbidden from buying any new games before Christmas, so [Mass
    Effect](http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect), [Assassin’s
    Creed](http://www.xbox.com/games/assassinscreed/) and [The Orange
    Box](http://www.xbox.com/games/orangebox/) will have to wait. My
    next game will either be [Blue
    Dragon](http://www.xbox.com/games/bluedragonxbox360/), which a
    friend let me borrow, or
    [R6:Vegas](http://www.xbox.com/games/tomclancyrainbowsixvegas/), yet
    another (but the last) game from last year I never got time to play.
-   I’ll skip the “giving thanks” jokes and point out that [Visual
    Studio
    2008](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/products/bb931214.aspx)
    and [.NET FX
    3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&displaylang=en)
    have shipped.  Soma has the
    [announcement](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-net-framework-3-5-shipped.aspx)
    and both [Scott
    Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-net-3-5-released.aspx)
    and [Sam
    Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-rtm-available-on-msdn-subscriber-downloads.aspx)
    summarize what’s new. The Express editions are available from the
    new [Express Developer
    Center](http://www.microsoft.com/express/default.aspx). The VS SDK
    doesn’t appear to be released yet, but I’m sure it will be along in
    due course.
-   Speaking of VS SDK, CoDe Magazine did an [entire
    issue](http://code-magazine.com/focus/vsx/) on VS Extensibility
    which you can read online or [download as
    PDF](http://code-magazine.com/Milos_DocumentManagement_DownloadFileAttachment.aspx?id=7bbfeccf-6167-4912-9c64-a0d984c524d4).
-   Nick Malik took a [bunch of
    heat](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/19/not-crazy-just-lateral-thinking.aspx)
    back in June for what [some
    thought](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/06/16/Redefining-reality.aspx)
    was a [redefinition of
    Mort](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/15/tools-for-mort.aspx),
    one of the Developer Division personas. Now Paul Vick thinks it’s
    time to [retire the Mort
    persona](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2007/11/14/22589.aspx),
    primarily because of the negative connotation the name carries. His
    suggestion for a replacement is Ben (as in Franklin). And did you
    notice how similar Paul’s description of Mort is to what Nick
    described? I’d say some folks owe Nick an apology.
-   I [said
    Friday](http://devhawk.net/2007/11/16/Afternoon+Coffee+123.aspx) I
    was going to take a closer look @ OpenID and OAuth. There’s an
    [intro to OpenID](http://wiki.openid.net/Introduction) on [their
    wiki](http://wiki.openid.net) and Sam Ruby’s [OpenID for
    non-SuperUsers](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers)
    seems to be the canonical source on implementing OpenID on your own
    blog. Frankly, reading the OpenID intro reminded me a lot of
    [WS-Federation Passive Requestor
    Profile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Federation_Passive_Requestor_Profile).
    Does OpenID have the equivalent of an “active” mode?
-   Likewise, the [Beginner’s Guide to
    OAuth](http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/10/beginners-guide.html)
    series of posts by Eran Hammer-Lahav is a good intro to OAuth. The
    phrase “Jane notices she is now at a Faji page by looking at the
    browser URL” from the [protocol
    walkthru](http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/10/beginners-gui-1.html)
    makes me worry that OAuth is vulnerable to phishing. Having one of
    the [OAuth
    authors](http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/spec/branches/1.0/drafts/6/spec.html#anchor1)
    call phishing victims
    [careless](http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/09/would-you-like-.html)
    and [wishing for Karl
    Rove](http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/09/oauth-needs-kar.html)
    to “scare people into being more careful and smarter about what they
    do online” makes me think my fears are well grounded. I’m thinking
    maybe OAuth and OpenID aren’t quite ready to [nail down WS-\*’s
    coffin](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/11/12/OpenIDOAuthIsTheFinalNailInTheCoffinOfTheWSVsRESTDiscussion.aspx).
-   In researching OpenID, I came across [this
    presentation](http://www.edtechpost.ca/wordpress/2007/11/14/openid-wcet-presentation/)
    hosted on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/). I had never seen
    SlideShare before – it’s kinda like YouTube for presentations.
    Sharing basic presentations is kinda lame – there doesn’t appear to
    be any animation support, so the slides are basically pictures.
    However, they also support
    “[slidecasting](http://www.slideshare.net/faqs/slidecast)” where you
    sync slides to an audio file hosted elsewhere. That I like. I have a
    bunch of old decks + audio, maybe I’ll stick them up there.
