<li>While my blog was down last week, I finally finished <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/gearsofwar/" target="_blank">Gears of War</a>. I played thru on hardcore, but had to throttle back to casual to beat the last boss. I&#8217;d like to try and finish on hardcore, but I&#8217;ve moved on to <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/deadrising/" target="_blank">Dead Rising</a> &#8211; another game from last year I never had time to finish. I&#8217;m almost done the main play mode, though I understand there are other play modes that get unlocked when you finish it.  </li>
<li>I&#8217;m forbidden from buying any new games before Christmas, so <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect" target="_blank">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/assassinscreed/" target="_blank">Assassin&#8217;s Creed</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/orangebox/" target="_blank">The Orange Box</a> will have to wait. My next game will either be <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bluedragonxbox360/" target="_blank">Blue Dragon</a>, which a friend let me borrow, or <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/tomclancyrainbowsixvegas/" target="_blank">R6:Vegas</a>, yet another (but the last) game from last year I never got time to play.  </li>
<li>I&#8217;ll skip the &#8220;giving thanks&#8221; jokes and point out that <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/products/bb931214.aspx" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2008</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&displaylang=en" target="_blank">.NET FX 3.5</a> have shipped.&nbsp; Soma has the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-net-framework-3-5-shipped.aspx" target="_blank">announcement</a> and both <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-net-3-5-released.aspx" target="_blank">Scott Guthrie</a> and <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-rtm-available-on-msdn-subscriber-downloads.aspx" target="_blank">Sam Gentile</a> summarize what&#8217;s new. The Express editions are available from the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/default.aspx" target="_blank">Express Developer Center</a>. The VS SDK doesn&#8217;t appear to be released yet, but I&#8217;m sure it will be along in due course. </li>
<li>Speaking of VS SDK, CoDe Magazine did an <a href="http://code-magazine.com/focus/vsx/" target="_blank">entire issue</a> on VS Extensibility which you can read online or <a href="http://code-magazine.com/Milos_DocumentManagement_DownloadFileAttachment.aspx?id=7bbfeccf-6167-4912-9c64-a0d984c524d4" target="_blank">download as PDF</a>. </li>
<li>Nick Malik took a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/19/not-crazy-just-lateral-thinking.aspx" target="_blank">bunch of heat</a> back in June for what <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/06/16/Redefining-reality.aspx" target="_blank">some thought</a> was a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/15/tools-for-mort.aspx" target="_blank">redefinition of Mort</a>, one of the Developer Division personas. Now Paul Vick thinks it&#8217;s time to <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2007/11/14/22589.aspx" target="_blank">retire the Mort persona</a>, primarily because of the negative connotation the name carries. His suggestion for a replacement is Ben (as in Franklin). And did you notice how similar Paul&#8217;s description of Mort is to what Nick described? I&#8217;d say some folks owe Nick an apology.  </li>
<li>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/11/16/Afternoon+Coffee+123.aspx" target="_blank">said Friday</a> I was going to take a closer look @ OpenID and OAuth. There&#8217;s an <a href="http://wiki.openid.net/Introduction" target="_blank">intro to OpenID</a> on <a href="http://wiki.openid.net" target="_blank">their wiki</a> and Sam Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers" target="_blank">OpenID for non-SuperUsers</a> seems to be the canonical source on implementing OpenID on your own blog. Frankly, reading the OpenID intro reminded me a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Federation_Passive_Requestor_Profile" target="_blank">WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile</a>. Does OpenID have the equivalent of an &#8220;active&#8221; mode?  </li>
<li>Likewise, the <a href="http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/10/beginners-guide.html" target="_blank">Beginner&#8217;s Guide to OAuth</a> series of posts by Eran Hammer-Lahav is a good intro to OAuth. The phrase &#8220;Jane notices she is now at a Faji page by looking at the browser URL&#8221; from the <a href="http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/10/beginners-gui-1.html" target="_blank">protocol walkthru</a> makes me worry that OAuth is vulnerable to phishing. Having one of the <a href="http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/spec/branches/1.0/drafts/6/spec.html#anchor1" target="_blank">OAuth authors</a> call phishing victims <a href="http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/09/would-you-like-.html" target="_blank">careless</a> and <a href="http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/09/oauth-needs-kar.html" target="_blank">wishing for Karl Rove</a> to &#8220;scare people into being more careful and smarter about what they do online&#8221; makes me think my fears are well grounded. I&#8217;m thinking maybe OAuth and OpenID aren&#8217;t quite ready to <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/11/12/OpenIDOAuthIsTheFinalNailInTheCoffinOfTheWSVsRESTDiscussion.aspx" target="_blank">nail down WS-*&#8217;s coffin</a>. </li>
<li>In researching OpenID, I came across <a href="http://www.edtechpost.ca/wordpress/2007/11/14/openid-wcet-presentation/" target="_blank">this presentation</a> hosted on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">SlideShare</a>. I had never seen SlideShare before &#8211; it&#8217;s kinda like YouTube for presentations. Sharing basic presentations is kinda lame &#8211; there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any animation support, so the slides are basically pictures. However, they also support &#8220;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/faqs/slidecast" target="_blank">slidecasting</a>&#8221; where you sync slides to an audio file hosted elsewhere. That I like. I have a bunch of old decks + audio, maybe I&#8217;ll stick them up there.</li>
