  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<ul><li>I've been off for two weeks, so getting back into "the swing" of things will probably take a day or two - both at work and on my blog. Hope everyone had a happy holiday season.</li><li>I ended <a href="http://devhawk.net/monthview.aspx?year=2007">the year</a> with 245 blog posts, which wasn't quite as many as either of my <a href="http://devhawk.net/monthview.aspx?year=2003">first</a><a href="http://devhawk.net/monthview.aspx?year=2004">two</a> years blogging, but was much more than I had been writing for the <a href="http://devhawk.net/monthview.aspx?year=2005">last</a><a href="http://devhawk.net/monthview.aspx?year=2006">two</a> years.</li><li>It was a <a href="http://www.zune.net">Zune</a> Xmas in the Pierson house. I got a pink Zune for my wife, and my mother and father got Zunes for each other. I got to load them all up with content for Xmas morning. Maybe I'm just used to WMP, but I'm not a huge fan of the Zune software. Yes, it's very pretty but it's missing some fairly basic features like automatic down-sampling lossless music. On the other hand, the on-device experience rocks and my wife is using her Zune regularly. I've got a trip to England coming up in April, and I'm thinking about getting one of the new 80GB ones for the trip.</li><li>They lost any chance of playing for the national championship, but USC sure <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=280010030">looked like a champion yesterday</a>. Seems appropriate for this crazy college football season that if Ohio State doesn't win big, pretty much all the other BCS bowl winners with a legitimate argument to be #1.</li><li>The Caps <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/boxscore?gameId=280101023">beat the eastern-conference leading Senators yesterday</a> for the third time this season and the second time in four days. They have 13 points in the last ten games and 10-5-4 since Boudreau took over as coach. If they keep that pace up, they would likely make the playoffs - that would be quite a feat given their horrific start.</li><li>Speaking of hockey, I watched most of the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=280101002">Winter Classic</a> yesterday, including the game-winning shootout goal by the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?playerId=3114">Anointed One</a>. It was really strange but cool to watch a hockey game between snowflakes. I agree with <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&amp;id=3176569">Scott Burnside's take</a> that these outdoor games are good for the league, but shouldn't be a regular part of the season.</li><li>I finished <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/orangebox">Portal</a> yesterday - that's a <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/12/28">fantastic game</a>. I also got <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect">Mass Effect</a>, so now I need to decide which to take on first: that or Half-Life 2. </li><li>A few months ago, I was <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/06/23/Home+Networking+Question.aspx">thinking about</a> using HomePlug for home networking but decided to <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/07/09/Upgrading+My+Home+Wireless+Network.aspx">upgrade my wireless network</a> instead. But recently I've started streaming movies from my loft computer to my Xbox, and the wireless network isn't always up to the task. I could run CAT5, but there's already an unused coax cable running up to the loft and I wondered if I could just use that? I discovered the <a href="http://www.mocalliance.org/">Multimedia over Coax Alliance</a>, but none of their <a href="http://www.mocalliance.org/en/industry/certified_products.asp">certified products</a> appear to be available. Those products have to share the home coax network with the cable company, but I can dedicate my coax cable. Anyone know a way to use coax to bridge CAT5 networks? Even something DIY?</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>
