  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[@Bob, We're big fans of Python 3k (though we'll skip 3.0 and go directly to 3.1) as ascii stings is a big source of incompatibility for IronPython. Now that we're (almost) past 2.6, we're trying to figure out our post 2.6 roadmap including when we ship IronPython 3.1.

@Jonathan, I think the best way for people to vote is to create work items on the IronPython CodePlex site since it's got a built in voting system. Also, have you looked tried the new 2.6 - I'd love to hear your thoughts on our improved startup time.

@Eric, Agreed on VS integration

@Dody, Agreed on app compat. Any suggestions beyond Michael's (Django, Trac, Mercurial)?]]></wp:comment_content>
