If all goes well, this will be the ONLY RC and we\u2019ll republish it as the RTW build in about a month. So if you\u2019ve been holding off on experimenting with the 2.6 release, now\u2019s the time to jump in with both feet. <\/p>\n<p>As I\u2019ve written before on this blog, this is a HUGE release for us:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 2.6 features such as <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.python.org\/whatsnew\/2.6.html#pep-343-the-with-statement\">with statement<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.python.org\/whatsnew\/2.6.html#pep-3129-class-decorators\">class decorators<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.python.org\/whatsnew\/2.6.html#pep-3112-byte-literals\">byte literals<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2009\/03\/27\/IronPython+26+Alpha+1.aspx\">Adaptive Compilation<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/CategoryView,category,__clrtype__.aspx\">__clrtype__ Metaclasses<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2009\/05\/21\/IronPython+26+Beta+1.aspx\">ctypes and Frames support<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2009\/07\/08\/MicrosoftScriptingDebugging.aspx\">Lightweight Debugging<\/a><\/li>\n<li>417 bugs fixed! <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Anyway, with 2.6 winding down, the IronPython team finds ourselves in a unique position that we\u2019ve never been in before: <u>caught up<\/u>. As far as I can tell, most of the Python community hasn\u2019t made the move to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.python.org\/download\/releases\/3.1\">Python 3.1<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.python.org\/dev\/peps\/pep-0373\/\">Python 2.7<\/a> is looking like it will be released <a href=\"http:\/\/mail.python.org\/pipermail\/python-dev\/2009-September\/092005.html\">next summer<\/a>. So IronPython is caught up with the latest version of Python most of the Python community appears to be using. <\/p>\n<p>So that begs the question: what do we do now?<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we want to hear from you regarding our next steps, but some things we are looking at include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><u>.NET Framework 4.0        <br \/><\/u>We\u2019ve shipped CTP releases of IronPython for each public beta of Visual Studio 2010 and\u00a0 .NET Framework 4.0. You can expect that to continue as Visual Studio 2010 winds down and ships. <\/li>\n<li><u>Fixing Bugs        <br \/><\/u>417 bugs fixed is good, but there are still 839 active work items in our issue tracker. In previous releases, we\u2019ve done minor bug fix releases every few months so we\u2019ll probably keep up that cadence. Make sure you go vote for bugs you think are important. <\/li>\n<li><u>App Compatibility        <br \/><\/u>One thing we can do is take some of the more popular Python apps such as Django and Mercurial and make sure they run well on IronPython. In some cases, there may need to be changes to the Python apps to get them to run on IronPython (for example, see <a href=\"http:\/\/jdhardy.blogspot.com\/2008\/07\/django-on-ironpython.html\">Jeff Hardy\u2019s patch<\/a> for running Django on IronPython) which assuredly means more time with lawyers for me. <\/li>\n<li><u>Missing Modules       <br \/><\/u>While IronPython 2.6 is our implementation of Python 2.6, there are binary modules we haven\u2019t implemented yet like <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.python.org\/library\/csv.html\">_csv<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.python.org\/library\/ast.html\">_ast<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.python.org\/library\/pyexpat.html\">pyexpat<\/a>. You could consider this App Compatibility work, but we have a different internal process for bug fixing and implementing new features so I broke this out separately.<\/li>\n<li><u>Documentation<\/u><br \/>Invariably an area for improvement in all software, our doc story today is pretty much \u201cgo look at docs.python.org\u201d. Of course, that doesn\u2019t cover any IronPython specific functionality. Of course, what would be great would be to combine existing Python docs with IronPython specific docs in a single reference, which also assuredly means more time with lawyers for me. <\/li>\n<li><u>Tutorials        <br \/><\/u>If you haven\u2019t seen Michael Foord\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trypython.org\/\">Try Python<\/a>, it\u2019s awesome. However, it was recently pointed out to me that it doesn\u2019t include any IronPython specific behavior (importing and interoperating with .NET types for example). The <a href=\"http:\/\/jimmy.schementi.com\/silverlight\/Tutorial\/\">IronRuby Tutorial<\/a> has specific IronRuby features and it would be awesome to do the same for IronPython. Of course, if we wrote new tutorials in <a href=\"http:\/\/docutils.sourceforge.net\/rst.html\">reStructured Text<\/a>, then I\u2019m guessing it would be easy for Michael to include it in Try Python via his <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/rst2xaml\/\">rst2xaml<\/a> tool. <\/li>\n<li><u>\u201cJust Text\u201d in Silverlight        <br \/><\/u>If you haven\u2019t seen MIX Online Labs <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visitmix.com\/Labs\/gestalt\/\">Gestalt project<\/a>, browse to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visitmix.com\/labs\/gestalt\/samples\/getting.started\/05_final.html\">one of the samples<\/a> and View Source. Python as \u201cjust text\u201d in the browser. Cool, eh? <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.jimmy.schementi.com\/\">Jimmy<\/a> is working on <a href=\"http:\/\/rubyforge.org\/pipermail\/ironruby-core\/2009-September\/005245.html\">implementing the \u201cjust text\u201d model<\/a> for the Silverlight version of IronPython (and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visitmix.com\/labs\/gestalt\/samples\/getting.started\/01_ruby.html\">IronRuby<\/a>). <\/li>\n<li><u>Visual Studio        <br \/><\/u>There\u2019s no work item for VS Integration in our issue tracker, but there have been <a href=\"https:\/\/connect.microsoft.com\/VisualStudio\/feedback\/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=475830\">112 votes for IronPython integration<\/a> (as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/connect.microsoft.com\/VisualStudio\/feedback\/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=479957\">79 votes for IronRuby integration<\/a>) in the VS 2010 connect bug database. No promises here, but we are acutely aware of how popular this suggestion is. <\/li>\n<li><u>CodePlex Foundation<\/u><br \/>The <a href=\"http:\/\/codeplex.org\/\">CodePlex Foundation<\/a> is a new non-profit foundation sponsored by Microsoft with the explicit mission \u201cto enable the exchange of code and understanding among software companies and open source communities.\u201d As one of the oldest open source projects at Microsoft, we are very interested in the CodePlex Foundation as you might imagine. However, CodePlex Foundation is VERY new &#8211; everything is tagged \u201cinterim\u201d for the first 100 days. Once the Foundation elects non-interim board members and establishes things like a charter and by-laws, you can be sure we\u2019ll be investigating it more thoroughly. In other words, definitely more time with lawyers for me. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In case I haven\u2019t said it lately, it\u2019s great working on the IronPython team with <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dinoviehland\/\">Dino Viehland<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/knowbody.livejournal.com\">Dave Fugate<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.ironpython.com\/pipermail\/users-ironpython.com\/2008-December\/009154.html\">David DiCato<\/a> (The IronRuby guys aren\u2019t bad either!). Also, I may whine about the amount of time I spend with lawyers, but honestly Yong, Kathryn and Kevin \u2013 our main LCA contacts \u2013 do a great job helping us figure out how and where to push the envelope so thanks to them as well.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We released the IronPython 2.6 release candidate on CodePlex yesterday.
