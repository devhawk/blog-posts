  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA["While I understand it’s every citizen’s duty to vote, it’s the government’s duty to enable the citizens to do their duty. We should treat the turnout as a grade, and 53% is a failure."

That's a faithful Democrat.  Blame the government for people's apathy.  Yeah, it's Bush's fault people don't bother to get off their butt and vote.

The Republican party advocates personal responsibility.  Your actions are no one's fault but your own.

I'm not celebrating the low turnout (I'm certainly celebrating the Bush win and Daschel loss though), I wish everyone legally eligible would vote.  I think it's kinda cool that Australia has a mandatory vote but I really don't think you can hold the governement responsible for these lame voter turnouts.]]></wp:comment_content>
