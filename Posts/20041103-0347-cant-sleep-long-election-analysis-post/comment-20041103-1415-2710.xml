  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Oh, now I understand.  When you said:

"While I understand it’s every citizen’s duty to vote, it’s the government’s duty to enable the citizens to do their duty. We should treat the turnout as a grade, and 53% is a failure." 

I took it that since you were saying "it's the government's duty" you were also saying that the government failed.  In fact, it sounds like you meant the people failed.  As the grammar challenged youths of today would say "My bad."  

I think it sucks that nearly half the population didn't vote.  I have at least one friend that isn't even registered and I'm pretty annoyed with him.

I don't know if voter reform is or is not a republican priority.  I don't think I've heard anyone talk about it from either party.  We all lament the low turnout but I've never really heard any politician suggest a government solution.  Maybe we need tax cuts for voters - that would be more palatable than Australia's fines.

I would agree, based on the popular vote distribution with 60% turnout I tend to think 100% turnout would still give the election to Bush.
