  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Steve, I'm not sure where in my post that I said it was "Bush's fault" or that I "blamed the goverment for people's apathy". I was trying to say (note it was almost 3am when I wrote this) that we shouldn't be proud of a 58%-60% turnout (estimates have come in since I originally posted). Goverment shouldn't be blamed, but it should be thinking of ways to get that number higher.

My comment about voter reform not being a Republican priority was the introduction to my investigation of the conventional wisdom of large turnout favoring Democrats. Honestly, I doubt a 100% voter turnout would have changed the outcome of the popular vote (which is all I looked at). 

Do you?]]></wp:comment_content>
