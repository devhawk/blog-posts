<p>I&#8217;m settling in to my new job. One way to tell, read <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.msn.com/">Dale Churchward&#8217;s blog</a>. Dale&#8217;s a teammate of mine. He only joined Microsoft a few months ago. Apparently, he used to blog at his old job, but either way we&#8217;ve now doubled the number of bloggers on my new team, with hopefully more to follow.</p>
<p>In addition to his opinions of <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.msn.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!113.entry">political discource</a> and the <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.msn.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!121.entry">Seahawks chances</a> next season, Dale&#8217;s got some interesting posts on <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.msn.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!127.entry">data integration</a> and <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.msn.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!129.entry">system diagrams</a>.
