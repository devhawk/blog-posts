It’s been a busy week. I was on [.NET
Rocks](http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=61),
we published [JOURNAL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal)
and I seem to have stirred up some discussion with my [endangered
middle-tier
post](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=950774a9-b33b-4a46-bb2b-a481cf946251).

But then I was silenced by a floppy disk.

My friend Tom, who hosts DevHawk and
[TechieWife](http://techiewife.com) for me, is on a contract job
out-of-state and couldn’t remotely diagnose why the web server that
hosts this blog wouldn’t reboot after a power-outage. Turns out there
was a floppy in the drive and go figure, the server tried to boot from
the floppy. So I’ve been offline all week. Still, I have to give Tom
props as

1.  He hosts me for free
2.  I have admin access to the machine
3.  He’s down to try new things

Being on .NET Rocks last week reminded my a little of my old [college DJ
days](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a902cf28-c4c3-4ed1-9c8a-ee71eaa760db).
I’ve got an idea I’d like to play around, but I’d need a media server.
That’s where \#3 above comes into play. I ask Tom and I receive. No idea
what I’m going to do with it yet, but now I have a media server to play
with. Thanks, Tom…You Rock!
