<p>It's been a busy week. I was on <a href="http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=61">.NET Rocks</a>, we published <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal">JOURNAL</a> and I seem to have stirred up some discussion with my <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=950774a9-b33b-4a46-bb2b-a481cf946251">endangered middle-tier post</a>. </p><p>But then I was silenced by a floppy disk. </p><p>My friend Tom, who hosts DevHawk and <a href="http://techiewife.com">TechieWife</a>Â for me, is on a contract job out-of-state and couldn't remotely diagnose why the web server that hosts this blog wouldn't reboot after a power-outage. Turns out there was a floppy in the drive and go figure, the server tried to boot from the floppy. So I've been offline all week. Still, I have to give Tom props as</p><ol><li>He hosts me for free</li><li>I have admin access to the machine</li><li>He's down to try new things</li></ol><p>Being on .NET Rocks last week reminded my a little of my old <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a902cf28-c4c3-4ed1-9c8a-ee71eaa760db">college DJ days</a>. I've got an idea I'd like to play around, but I'd need a media server. That's where #3 above comes into play. I ask Tom and I receive. No idea what I'm going to do with it yet, but now I have a media server to play with. Thanks, Tom...You Rock!</p>
