Traditionally, our team has divided architects into three categories: Strategic, Application and Infrastructure. Gurpreet Pall, of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/edc/rak/msaedc.asp">MSA Enterprise Data Center</a> fame and the new head of our Architecture Strategy team, suggested a different categorization scheme: Component, System and System-of-Systems. I like this scheme because it is more hierarchical where the scopes of strategic, application and infrastructure architects have small intersections.
<p>Gurpeet's scheme is also interesting in that component architects of system-of-systems architects don't typically have much to talk about. Component architecture is below the abstraction layer for system-of-systems architects.</p><p>I'm not suggesting one view is better than the other, they are both interesting views into the same space. However, I'd like a better term than "system-of-systems architect".</p>
