-   A warm welcome goes out to the 110th congress. Between the
    Democratic majority in both houses and Republicans looking to
    distance themselves from President Decider and his abysmal approval
    ratings, maybe we’ll actually get something accomplished in the next
    two years.
-   Not as nice as USC trouncing Michigan, but I like seeing Notre Dame
    on the receiving end of a [41-14
    beatdown](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=270030099&confId=null)
    from LSU in the Sugar Bowl. That’s the 9th consecutive bowl loss for
    the Irish.
-   Actually started getting some work done yesterday. Today I’m doing
    some WCF STS work, but yesterday I focused on SSB and WF.
-   I need to better understand WF’s faulting and compensation model. I
    got sidetracked yesterday when I realized that when a WF instance
    faults, the built-in SQL persistence service deletes the persisted
    instance from the database. That doesn’t seem right to me, but [I
    was
    wrong](http://devhawk.net/2006/10/17/WF+Clarifications+And+Corrections.aspx)
    last time I called out the WF SQL persistence service so I want to
    do more digging before I open my trap.
-   I dig WF persistence. I [wrote a few weeks
    ago](http://devhawk.net/2006/12/11/Transactions+In+Workflow+Foundationland.aspx)
    about shipping a WF instance to a developer for debugging.
    Yesterday, I thought about having a persistence service that kept a
    history of the WF instance rather than overwriting it. I wonder if
    that would help with production debugging?
-   Great quote yesterday by my boss, speaking ill of a project that
    will remain nameless:\
    “Basically, they’ve spent the last month building an executive
    presentation to say we’re screwed”
