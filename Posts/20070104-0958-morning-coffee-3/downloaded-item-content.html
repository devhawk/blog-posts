<li>A warm welcome goes out to the 110th congress. Between the Democratic majority in both houses and Republicans looking to distance themselves from President Decider and his abysmal approval ratings, maybe we&#8217;ll actually get something accomplished in the next two years.</li>
<li>Not as nice as USC trouncing Michigan, but I like seeing Notre Dame on the receiving end of a <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=270030099&confId=null">41-14 beatdown</a> from LSU in the Sugar Bowl. That&#8217;s the 9th consecutive bowl loss for the Irish. </li>
<li>Actually started getting some work done yesterday. Today I&#8217;m doing some WCF STS work, but yesterday I focused on SSB and WF. </li>
<li>I need to better understand WF&#8217;s faulting and compensation model. I got sidetracked yesterday when I realized that when a WF instance faults, the built-in SQL persistence service deletes the persisted instance from the database. That doesn&#8217;t seem right to me, but <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/10/17/WF+Clarifications+And+Corrections.aspx">I was wrong</a> last time I called out the WF SQL persistence service so I want to do more digging before I open my trap.</li>
<li>I dig WF persistence. I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/12/11/Transactions+In+Workflow+Foundationland.aspx">wrote a few weeks ago</a> about shipping&nbsp;a WF instance to a developer for debugging. Yesterday, I thought about having a persistence service that kept a history of the WF instance rather than overwriting it. I wonder if that would help with production debugging?</li>
<li>Great quote yesterday by my boss, speaking ill of a project that will remain nameless:<br>&#8220;Basically, they&#8217;ve spent the last month building an executive presentation to say we&#8217;re screwed&#8221;</li>
