    [announces](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/12/13/xna-game-studio-2-0-released.aspx)
    the release of XNA Game Studio 2.0 and Major Nelson [points
    to](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/1212-xnasupportslive.htm)
    the [press
    release](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/1212-xnasupportslive.htm)
    announcing the release. You can get [the
    bits](http://creators.xna.com/Education/GettingStarted.aspx) from
    XNA Creators Club Online (the [XNA dev
    center](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/xna/) has yet to be updated).
-   Speaking of XNA, David Weller [points
    out](http://letskilldave.com/archive/2007/12/10/dream-build-play-2-0-warmup-challenge-kicking-off-soon.aspx)
    the warm-up challenge for [Dream-Build-Play
    2008](http://dreambuildplay.com/). I assume networking will be a big
    part of this years’ entries, but the warm-up challenge is to “Create
    a new and innovative use of Artificial Intelligence in a game”.
-   Still speaking of XNA, Gamasutra has an
    [interview](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16618)
    with XNA GM Chris Satchell where he hints at a publishing channel
    for XNA games on the Xbox 360, with “full details” coming sometime
    in the new year.
-   The Capitals [beat the Rangers in
    overtime](http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=447&season=20072008&gameType=2)
    last night. Since changing coaches on Thanksgiving, they’re 6-3-1.
    That’s great, but they’re still five games under .500. The good news
    is that even though the Caps tied for last in the league, they’re
    only six points out of a playoff spot with about fifty games left in
    the season.
-   My old team puts on an event every year called the Strategic
    Architects Forum. It’s invite-only, but they’ve posted some of the
    [videos, slides and
    transcripts](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb267380.aspx)
    from this year’s event.

    [discusses](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmeier/archive/2007/12/12/new-release-guidance-explorer-is-now-on-msdn.aspx)
    the new Guidance Explorer release. They’re now up to 3,000 “nuggets”
    of guidance and they’ve moved the guidance store to MSDN. (via [Sam
    Gentle](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/12/13/new-and-notable-211.aspx))
-   Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz [explains
    further](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CirrusMinor/~3/198879813/WhyArbitraryTiersplittingIsBad.aspx)
    why arbitrary tier-splitting is bad. I’d also suggest reading
    Chapter 7 of [PoEAA](http://www.martinfowler.com/books.html#eaa)
    which provides another version of the same story: You can’t take an
    object that’s designed for fine-grained local access and make it
    remote without really screwing yourself up.

    [thinks](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2007/10/04/path-finding-using-a-in-c-3-0-part-two.aspx)
    immutable data structures are “the way of the future in C\#” so he’s
    written a series on immutability. Posts include [kinds of
    immutability](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2007/11/13/immutability-in-c-part-one-kinds-of-immutability.aspx),
    an [immutable
    stack](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2007/12/04/immutability-in-c-part-two-a-simple-immutable-stack.aspx),
    an [immutable covariant
    stack](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2007/12/06/immutability-in-c-part-three-a-covariant-immutable-stack.aspx)
    and an [immutable
    queue](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2007/12/10/immutability-in-c-part-four-an-immutable-queue.aspx).
    As [I’ve
    discussed](http://devhawk.net/2007/12/04/functional-understanding/),
    immutable data structures are HUGE in functional programming. Eric’s
    immutable stacks and queues are similar to F\#’s [native list
    type](http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/manual/quicktour.aspx#QuickTourLists).
