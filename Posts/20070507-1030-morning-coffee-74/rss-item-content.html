<p>Light on the geek factor this morning:</p><ul><li>My <a href="http://devhawk.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!1pd96NFMdcR3fPB4MoLEMQcA!236.entry">daughter Rileyanne</a> turned two Saturday so we had a little pool party. One of the major selling points when we bought the house was the double sized hot tub in the back deck. So even though it was only in the mid 60s, we could still get in and swim.  </li><li>Saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413300/">Spiderman 3</a> yesterday. I liked the first two very much, but this one is iffy at best. The problem with these blockbuster movie series is the perceived need to be "bigger" than the previous installments. So we get more effects, more action, more villains. But that usually means less drama and less story. Spiderman 3 is no exception. Here's hoping that Christopher Nolan's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413300/">Batman</a> series doesn't suffer the same fate. </li><li>Lost <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-05-06-lost_N.htm">announces</a> an end date. There will be three more shortened seasons for a grand total of 48 episodes (plus the three remaining this season). While I love Lost, I'm glad they're going this route.  </li><li>Politics 2.0 Watch: according to their blog, <a href="http://qubetv.tv/">QubeTV.tv</a> is "the conservatives’ answer to YouTube". Two thoughts on this: First, Having a site of conservative videos for conservatives seems like preaching to the choir. Second, to quote <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/05/youtube_biased.html">Andrew Sullivan</a>: "It's not a good sign when a movement cannot engage the mainstream." </li><li>John Shewchuk as <a href="http://connectedsystems.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!10E0A1CD60CAE1A9!258.entry">more details</a> of the BizTalk.net <a href="http://connect.biztalk.net/">connectivity service</a>. Hybrid mode and Direct connect are nice optimizations, but don't change the messaging semantics at all. But pub/sub eventing does, so I'm primarily interested in that capability. </li></ul>
