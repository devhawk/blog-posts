Light on the geek factor this morning:

-   My [daughter
    Rileyanne](http://devhawk.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!1pd96NFMdcR3fPB4MoLEMQcA!236.entry)
    turned two Saturday so we had a little pool party. One of the major
    selling points when we bought the house was the double sized hot tub
    in the back deck. So even though it was only in the mid 60s, we
    could still get in and swim.
-   Saw [Spiderman 3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413300/) yesterday. I
    liked the first two very much, but this one is iffy at best. The
    problem with these blockbuster movie series is the perceived need to
    be “bigger” than the previous installments. So we get more effects,
    more action, more villains. But that usually means less drama and
    less story. Spiderman 3 is no exception. Here’s hoping that
    Christopher Nolan’s [Batman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413300/)
    series doesn’t suffer the same fate.
-   Lost
    [announces](http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-05-06-lost_N.htm)
    an end date. There will be three more shortened seasons for a grand
    total of 48 episodes (plus the three remaining this season). While I
    love Lost, I’m glad they’re going this route.
-   Politics 2.0 Watch: according to their blog,
    [QubeTV.tv](http://qubetv.tv/) is “the conservatives’ answer to
    YouTube”. Two thoughts on this: First, Having a site of conservative
    videos for conservatives seems like preaching to the choir. Second,
    to quote [Andrew
    Sullivan](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/05/youtube_biased.html):
    “It’s not a good sign when a movement cannot engage the mainstream.”
-   John Shewchuk as [more

    of the BizTalk.net [connectivity
    service](http://connect.biztalk.net/). Hybrid mode and Direct
    connect are nice optimizations, but don’t change the messaging
    semantics at all. But pub/sub eventing does, so I’m primarily
    interested in that capability.
