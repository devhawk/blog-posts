  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I wasn't complaining about QubeTV.tv (name created by the Dept. of Redunancy Dept.) I was just making a couple of observations about it. Frankly, I don't think the site founders really get the concept of social networking and user created content, but that's not a cause for me to complain. 

I'm not particularly familiar with MoveOn, but AFAIK they don't describe themselves as "YouTube for Liberals". A quick glance around their site and I found their VideoVets project (http://pol.moveon.org/videovets/). All those videos are hosted on YouTube and embedded in MoveOn's site. So not sure it's much of a comparison.]]></wp:comment_content>
