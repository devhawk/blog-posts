I liked the first two very much, but this one is iffy at best. The problem with these blockbuster movie series is the perceived need to be &#8220;bigger&#8221; than the previous installments. So we get more effects, more action, more villains. But that usually means less drama and less story. Spiderman 3 is no exception. Here&#8217;s hoping that Christopher Nolan&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0413300\/\">Batman<\/a> series doesn&#8217;t suffer the same fate. <\/li>\n<li>Lost <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/life\/television\/news\/2007-05-06-lost_N.htm\">announces<\/a> an end date. There will be three more shortened seasons for a grand total of 48 episodes (plus the three remaining this season). While I love Lost, I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;re going this route.  <\/li>\n<li>Politics 2.0 Watch: according to their blog, <a href=\"http:\/\/qubetv.tv\/\">QubeTV.tv<\/a>\u00a0is &#8220;the conservatives\u2019 answer to YouTube&#8221;. Two thoughts on this: First, Having a site of conservative videos\u00a0for conservatives seems like preaching to the choir. Second, to quote <a href=\"http:\/\/andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com\/the_daily_dish\/2007\/05\/youtube_biased.html\">Andrew Sullivan<\/a>: &#8220;It&#8217;s not a good sign when a movement cannot engage the mainstream.&#8221; <\/li>\n<li>John Shewchuk as <a href=\"http:\/\/connectedsystems.spaces.live.com\/Blog\/cns!10E0A1CD60CAE1A9!258.entry\">more details<\/a> of the BizTalk.net <a href=\"http:\/\/connect.biztalk.net\/\">connectivity service<\/a>. Hybrid mode and Direct connect are nice optimizations, but don&#8217;t change the messaging semantics at all. But pub\/sub eventing does, so I&#8217;m primarily interested in that capability. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Light on the geek factor this morning: My daughter Rileyanne turned two\u00a0Saturday so we had a little pool party.
