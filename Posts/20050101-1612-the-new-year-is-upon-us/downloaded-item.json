New Year&#8217;s was spent with Julie&#8217;s side of the family &#8211; three of Patty&#8217;s four children and all six of her grandkids are at Brother Jim&#8217;s in Santa Barbara. Even Julie&#8217;s dad drove up, making it the first time this much of her family was together since Julie and I got married 4 1\/2 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s hard to be happy without feeling for the people who&#8217;s family and friends were devastated by last week&#8217;s tsunami. I&#8217;ve got a few friends in the area &#8211; I&#8217;ve done TechEd Malaysia twice and have been working closely with the Indian MSFT office of late. I&#8217;ve heard from I think everyone I know in the region and luckily they&#8217;re all OK (though one had a close call). Of course, there are countless others who were not so lucky and my heart goes out to them. I wish I had more to say, but given the scale and scope of this tragedy, mere words seem almost trite. <\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t make resolutions anymore, since they are pretty much the same every year (more time with family, lose weight, smarter with money, etc.) I make a little progress on each every year &#8211; enough to be somewhat proud of but not enough that I can quit working on it. I&#8217;ve been reading <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chaordic.org\/who_hock2.html\">Dee Hock&#8217;s<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/o\/ASIN\/1576750744\">Birth of the Chaordic Age<\/a> which my <a href=\"http:\/\/halpierson.blogspot.com\/\">Dad<\/a> lent me at thanksgiving and I&#8217;m really enjoying it. I&#8217;ve marked down several passages, but this one seems most appropriate for the new year:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Riches are not in the number of possessions, but the fewness of wants.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>By that measure, I know few richer than myself. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Christmas was spent with just my local family &#8211; me, Julie, Patrick and Julie&#8217;s mom Patty (who lives ten minutes away).
