After a week’s vacation, I’m back in the office. I might have left with
an empty inbox and newsreader, but I returned to nearly 300 emails and
over 500 news items. Actually, 300 emails for a week is actually really
good – most of them are in my “low priority” folder which means they are
internal mailing list emails rather than things I actually have to deal
with.

Major thanks to [Dale](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/) for keeping
the lights on around here while I was gone. With my renewed commitment
to blogging this year, I’d rather not see DevHawk “go dark” for a week
while I get some R&R. If you liked what Dale had to say, go [subscribe
to his blog](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/feed.rss). I hope he
keeps up with his daily posts, now that he’s no longer on the hook
around here.

Anyway, since I have little idea what’s going on in the technical
blogosphere, this is a vacation wrapup instead. Normal Morning Coffee
returns tomorrow.

-   We spent a week in Southern California. Two days with my
    brother-in-law in Santa Barbara, two days at Disneyland and two days
    with my uncles in Palm Springs (with travel days between). We had a
    blast, but that’s a lot of driving. Next vacation, we’re going
    somewhere we don’t know anybody and staying put the entire time.
-   My brother-in-law has three kids, including a son a few months older
    than Patrick and a daughter a few months younger than Riley. I’ve
    long said I would *never* move back to Cali, but seeing them all
    play together made me think it might be worth it. I don’t have any
    cousins (my father was an only child and neither of my mother’s two
    siblings had kids) so I didn’t realize what a big deal it is. I
    think Patrick misses his cousin Jack more than he misses Disneyland.
-   When I lived in LA, I used to have a season pass to Disneyland. But
    seeing it thru my kids’ eyes made it brand new again. Our two days
    in “The Happiest Place on Earth” were a blast, though in retrospect
    we should have taken a day to rest and hang out at the pool between
    the two days.
-   Riley’s favorite ride was [Pirates of the
    Caribbean](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAttractionPage)
    (which she calls “Yo ho ho”). My friend Brooke told Jules that
    little kids “natural reaction” is to hold on tight during the drops,
    but Riley put her little hands up and shouted “Wee!” They recently
    added some elements from the movies (Capt. Jack Sparrow and Davy
    Jones) to the ride. My wife and I were worried they were going to
    ruin it, but the changes were fairly small and subtle and we liked
    them.
-   Patrick’s favorite ride was [Buzz Lightyear Astro
    Blasters](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=BuzzLightyearAttractionPage) but
    the [Jedi Training
    Academy](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/entertainment/detail?name=JediTrainingAcademyEntertainmentPage)
    was a close second. His Jedi training was my favorite moment at
    Disneyland. He got to [train with a
    lightsaber](http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=9914b46a-f969-4b5d-81a9-d6734d1018ba)
    and [fight Darth
    Maul](http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=a029e258-7a76-4e39-a882-b44275397cd2).
    Here’s a video clip of my young Padawan:

    The big problem with Jedi Training Academy is that they only pick a
    limited number of “younglings” every show. Patrick didn’t get picked
    the first time we went, and frankly I pushed him out there the
    second time without him officially getting picked. You could
    conceivably waste an entire day at Disneyland attending all six
    Training Academy shows and never get picked. That sucks.
-   Biggest disappointment of Disneyland: Patrick being 1″ too short for
    [Star
    Tours](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=StarToursAttractionPage).
    I was bummed.
-   [Disney’s California
    Adventure](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/landing?name=DisneysCaliforniaAdventureLandingPage)
    is a nice adjunct to Disneyland, but as a stand alone park it pretty
    much blows, though Jules and I did enjoy the [Tower of
    Terror](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=TwilightZoneTowerOfTerrorAttractionPage).
-   Disneyland seems to becoming Disney-Pixar Land. Pixar movies are the
    basis for several of the newer rides, including the new [Finding
    Nemo
    ride](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=FindingNemoSubmarineVoyageAttractionPage)
    opening this summer. There was [an
    article](http://www.hemispheresmagazine.com/feb07/entertainthis.html)
    in the Disneyland Pixar Evolution in the airplane magazine so I’m
    not the only one who’s noticed.
-   After two days in Disneyland, I expected Palm Springs to be a let
    down. But instead it was a nice casual cool down after two hectic
    days in the Magic Kingdom. Plus it was great to see my Uncles, who
    we hadn’t seen since last summer when my brother got married.
-   We flew home Saturday so we could have a casual Sunday before
    heading back to work and school today. We watched [Phantom
    Menace](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120915/) last night, though the
    kids are still a bit young for it. We decided on Episode I instead
    of the original [Star Wars](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/)
    because it has a little boy (i.e. like Patrick) and a fight with
    Darth Maul (i.e. like Patrick). But it doesn’t hold a candle to the
    original trilogy.
