In trolling for [HW
suggestions](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=abbb7541-ee98-4c73-a8c2-fb4da91c4948),
I forgot to mention what I’m planning on using the HW for. I’ve got a
couple of things in mind:

-   Public facing web/media server. Family members are constantly asking
    for updated pictures of Patrick. I’ve gotten tired of regularly
    uploading pictures to a public website for them to download. I’ve
    got them all on my personal machine, so it would be much easier just
    to expose them directly. Similarly, between our camcorder, the video
    functions of our digital cameras and
    [PhotoStory](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory),
    I also have quite a bit of video media to make available to the rest
    of my family.
-   Experimental / development server. ASP.NET 2.0 is coming, so if I’m
    going to expose photos and/or video, I might as well take advantage
    of the new stuff to do it with. I’m also thinking about writing some
    apps for keeping track of my [family
    tree](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e34c9e58-db72-4b98-828d-becb653feda4)
    along with my [dad](http://halpierson.blogspot.com/) and cousin.
-   Movie making / 3D Rendering. I was working on my garage over the
    weekend and I came across my old copy of [3D Studio
    Max](http://www4.discreet.com/3dsmax/). It’s up to version 7 now, so
    my copy of version 1.0 is way behind the times. I’ve been interested
    in movie making for a long time and if (when?) I get back into it I
    know I’ll want to do some effects work – stuff like [Matrix
    XP](http://www.matrix-xp.com/). This is where the Intel P4 HT vs.
    AMD Athlon 64 question really comes into play. Dual core vs. 64
    bits?

One thing that’s not on this list is Media Center. I’m interested in
[MCE05](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter), but then
yesterday MSFT and Comcast
[announce](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/nov04/11-08ComcastDeploymentPR.asp)
that they are rolling out [Microsoft TV Foundation
Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/tv/content/Solutions/Foundation/MSTV_Foundation_Main.mspx)
in Washington state starting next week. I think, in the end, I’ll want
MCE since I’d like the ability to hack my TV but for now I think I want
to try out the MSTV stuff. Also, the HDTV story around MCE doesn’t look
clear yet – it works with [“over-the-air”
HDTV](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/evaluation/hdtv/default.mspx),
but makes no mention of cable delivered HDTV. I think the HW in this
area is pretty new, but I would guess that would change in the next 6-12
months.

Update – I just spoke to Comcast regarding the MSTV functionallity.
Their PVR functionallity supports both HD and non-HD programs so I’m
definitely going to give that a try. Only downside – they can’t come
install for a week and a half.
:frowning:
