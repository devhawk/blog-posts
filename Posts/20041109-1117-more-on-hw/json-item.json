I&#8217;ve got a couple of things in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Public facing web\/media server. Family members are constantly asking for updated pictures of Patrick. I&#8217;ve gotten tired of regularly uploading pictures to a public website for them to download. I&#8217;ve got them all on my personal machine, so it would be much easier just to expose them directly. Similarly, between our camcorder, the video functions of our digital cameras and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsxp\/using\/digitalphotography\/photostory\">PhotoStory<\/a>, I also have quite a bit of video media to make available to the rest of my family.\n<\/li>\n<li>Experimental \/ development server. ASP.NET 2.0 is coming, so if I&#8217;m going to expose photos and\/or video, I might as well take advantage of the new stuff to do it with. I&#8217;m also thinking about writing some apps for keeping track of my <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e34c9e58-db72-4b98-828d-becb653feda4\">family tree<\/a> along with my <a href=\"http:\/\/halpierson.blogspot.com\/\">dad<\/a> and cousin.\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p align=\"left\">Movie making \/ 3D Rendering. I was working on my garage over the weekend and I came across my old copy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www4.discreet.com\/3dsmax\/\">3D Studio Max<\/a>. It&#8217;s up to version 7 now, so my copy of version 1.0 is way behind the times. I&#8217;ve been interested in movie making for a long time and if (when?) I get back into it I know I&#8217;ll want to do some effects work &#8211; stuff like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.matrix-xp.com\/\">Matrix XP<\/a>. This is where the Intel P4 HT vs. AMD Athlon 64 question really comes into play. Dual core vs. 64 bits?<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One thing that&#8217;s not on this list is Media Center. I&#8217;m interested in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsxp\/mediacenter\">MCE05<\/a>, but then yesterday MSFT and Comcast <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/press\/2004\/nov04\/11-08ComcastDeploymentPR.asp\">announce<\/a> that they are rolling out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/tv\/content\/Solutions\/Foundation\/MSTV_Foundation_Main.mspx\">Microsoft TV Foundation Edition<\/a> in Washington state starting next week. I think, in the end, I&#8217;ll want MCE since I&#8217;d like the ability to hack my TV but for now I think I want to try out the MSTV stuff. Also, the HDTV story around MCE doesn&#8217;t look clear yet &#8211; it works with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsxp\/mediacenter\/evaluation\/hdtv\/default.mspx\">&#8220;over-the-air&#8221; HDTV<\/a>, but makes no mention of cable delivered HDTV. I think the HW in this area is pretty new, but I would guess that would change in the next 6-12 months. <\/p>\n<p>Update &#8211; I just spoke to Comcast regarding the MSTV functionallity. Their PVR functionallity supports both HD and non-HD programs so I&#8217;m definitely going to give that a try. Only downside &#8211; they can&#8217;t come install for a week and a half. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In trolling for HW suggestions, I forgot to mention what I&#8217;m planning on using the HW for.
