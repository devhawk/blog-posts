<p>Yesterday, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/New+DSL+Tool+Drop+Available.aspx">mentioned</a> that you need VC++ installed to use the <a href="http://labs.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/Workshop/DSLTools/default.aspx">DSL Toolkit</a>. Apparently, it&#8217;s needed for building a DLL related to VS integration. However, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/">Gareth</a> let me know that they should be able to do that with managed code in a future build which means they won&#8217;t have a dependency on VC++. I didn&#8217;t install VC++ because I was trying to save space in my VPC where I&#8217;m running the VS2005 beta 1 bits.</p>
