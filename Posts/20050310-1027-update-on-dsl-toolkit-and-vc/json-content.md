Yesterday, I
[mentioned](http://devhawk.net/2005/03/09/new-dsl-tool-drop-available/) that
you need VC++ installed to use the [DSL
Toolkit](http://labs.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/Workshop/DSLTools/default.aspx).
Apparently, it’s needed for building a DLL related to VS integration.
However, [Gareth](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/) let me know that they
should be able to do that with managed code in a future build which
means they won’t have a dependency on VC++. I didn’t install VC++
because I was trying to save space in my VPC where I’m running the
VS2005 beta 1 bits.
