<p>&nbsp;Last December, Arvindra Sehmi of Microsoft EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) created JOURNAL &#8211; the Microsoft&#8217;s Architects JOURNAL &#8211; to great success. Now, with the publication of JOURNAL 2, we have launched <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal/">JOURNAL&#8217;s new homepage</a> on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/">MSDN Architecture Center</a>. You can read the articles online in the MSDN library or download the full issues as PDFs. (To anyone who previously downloaded the JOURNAL 1 PDF, we&#8217;ve reformatted the PDF so that it will print on A4 or US Letter sized paper without having to shrink it to the point of near-unreadability.) </p>
<p>BTW, you do have to fill out a profile questionnaire to get access to the PDF&#8217;s. And since we want to encourage people to fill out the profile questionnaire, we&#8217;ve only published one article from JOURNAL 2 on MSDN so far. We&#8217;ll publish one of the remaining articles on MSDN every couple of weeks. However, to whet your appetite, the article we choose to publish is the cornerstone of JOURNAL 2 &#8211; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj2metrop.asp">Pat Helland&#8217;s Metropolis</a>. It&#8217;s based from Pat&#8217;s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series">Architecture Strategy Series</a> presentation of the same title, where he drawn a parallel between the evolution of cities and the evolution of information technology shops. It&#8217;s a very powerful analogy for understanding that we&#8217;re at the very beginning of the Information Revolution and that we have a long long way to go.</p>
<p>Please <a href="mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com?subject=Microsoft's Architects JOURNAL">drop me a line</a> or leave a comment with your thoughts on JOURNAL. It&#8217;s a quarterly publication, so look for JOURNAL 3 in July. In the meantime, we&#8217;re always looking for authors, so <a href="mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com?subject=I want to write for JOURNAL!">let me know</a> if you have an idea for an article.</p>
