Now, with the publication of JOURNAL 2, we have launched <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/journal\/\">JOURNAL&#8217;s new homepage<\/a> on the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/\">MSDN Architecture Center<\/a>. You can read the articles online in the MSDN library or download the full issues as PDFs. (To anyone who previously downloaded the JOURNAL 1 PDF, we&#8217;ve reformatted the PDF so that it will print on A4 or US Letter sized paper without having to shrink it to the point of near-unreadability.) <\/p>\n<p>BTW, you do have to fill out a profile questionnaire to get access to the PDF&#8217;s. And since we want to encourage people to fill out the profile questionnaire, we&#8217;ve only published one article from JOURNAL 2 on MSDN so far. We&#8217;ll publish one of the remaining articles on MSDN every couple of weeks. However, to whet your appetite, the article we choose to publish is the cornerstone of JOURNAL 2 &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/journal\/default.aspx?pull=\/library\/en-us\/dnmaj\/html\/aj2metrop.asp\">Pat Helland&#8217;s Metropolis<\/a>. It&#8217;s based from Pat&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/overview\/series\">Architecture Strategy Series<\/a> presentation of the same title, where he drawn a parallel between the evolution of cities and the evolution of information technology shops. It&#8217;s a very powerful analogy for understanding that we&#8217;re at the very beginning of the Information Revolution and that we have a long long way to go.<\/p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com?subject=Microsoft's Architects JOURNAL\">drop me a line<\/a> or leave a comment with your thoughts on JOURNAL. It&#8217;s a quarterly publication, so look for JOURNAL 3 in July.
