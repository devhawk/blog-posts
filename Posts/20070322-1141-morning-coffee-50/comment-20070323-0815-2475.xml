  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mike, everyone's entitled to their own opinions. Nice to know people can enjoy my blog while disagreeing with my political opinions.

However, I wanted to correct one thing in your comment: Phil de Villis - the guy that made the video - wasn't fired by his employer, he resigned by choice. From the blog post I linked to above (that he wrote): "The company had no idea that I'd created the ad, and neither did any of our clients. But I've decided to resign anyway so as not to harm them, even by implication."]]></wp:comment_content>
