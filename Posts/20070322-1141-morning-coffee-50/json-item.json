Republican politicians are no worse at the kind of dissent-stifling than Democratic politicians.  One good example is the &#8220;Fairness Doctrine.&#8221;  The R&#8217;s aren&#8217;t particularly interested in the concept (because it&#8217;s the *conservative* talk shows that are the target of such legislation, natch), but the D&#8217;s would dearly love to stifle that kind of dissent, and so the FD is a perennial topic among them.  Just like those fine folks who appear to want to make dissent on Global Warming into some kind of crime.<\/p>\n<p>Harry, they are mostly all of them demogogues and afraid to death of dissent.  Some of them are just better at hiding it.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and by the way, the guy who got fired for this was fired by his employer, who is definitely D.  Of course, considering that they have an economic stake in the D&#8217;s, it is completely understandable.  An R-related firm would have done the same.<\/p>\n","parent":0},{"id":2475,"name":"DevHawk","url":"","date":"2007-03-23 08:15:23","content":"<p>Mike, everyone&#8217;s entitled to their own opinions.
