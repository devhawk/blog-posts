<li>Nick Carr on <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/03/is_a_neutral_ne.php">net neutrality</a>: &#8220;Protocol is neutral. Infrastructure isn&#8217;t.&#8221; This is a more complicated issue than it appears on the surface.  </li>
<li>Nick Malik on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/03/22/understanding-enterprise-architecture.aspx">enterprise architecture</a>: &#8220;Enterprise Architecture is not about &#8216;building solutions right&#8217;.

<li>If there had been a good quote on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick">Nicholas Allen&#8217;s blog</a> today, then I could declare it &#8220;Quote a Nick&#8221; day. Alas, his&nbsp;posting on&nbsp;how to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/03/22/responding-to-getproperty.aspx">respond to GetProperty</a> isn&#8217;t very quotable. </li>
<li>Hot on the heels of the new GAT CTP is the new <a href="http://softwarefactoriestoolkit.net/Download_Feb07CTP.aspx">Software Factories Toolkit CTP</a> from Clarius. Among other new features is a Recipe Designer. Having mucked around in the Recipe XML, this is A Good Thing<sup>TM</sup> (via <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1104.aspx">Larkware</a>) </li>
<li>Politics 2.0 Watch: Phil de Vellis &#8211; the guy that made &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h3G-lMZxjo">Vote Different</a>&#8220;, the Hillary Clinton/Apple 1984 video mashup &#8211; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-de-vellis-aka-parkridge/i-made-the-vote-differen_b_43989.html">said he made said video</a> in part because he &#8220;wanted to show that an individual citizen can affect the process&#8221;. Furthermore, &#8220;This shows that the future of American politics rests in the hands of ordinary citizens.&#8221; Personally, Bush as Big Brother would have been more appropriate, but I think the video got more attention becuase it cast Hillary in that role. </li>
