<p>With apparently no fanfare, the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (or BPEL) spec has been reved to 1.1. You can get it online from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbiz2k2/html/bpel1-1.asp?frame=true"> MSDN</a>, <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-bpel/">IBM developerWorks</a> and <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/techtracks/BPEL4WS.jsp"> BEA dev2dev</a>. For those who haven't seen BPEL, it: "BPEL4WS represents a convergence of the ideas in the <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/xml_wsspecs/xlang-c/default.htm">XLANG</a> and <a href="http://www-3.ibm.com/software/solutions/webservices/pdf/WSFL.pdf"> WSFL</a> specifications." XLANG is the language that powers <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/biztalk/">Microsoft BizTalk Server</a>. </p><p>In other personal programming news, even though I'm in a <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=6a7eecb5-9ba3-4322-88ac-158d821797c9">Phoenix</a><a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=d040a503-81f8-4548-b6d1-d87f9d14cf8e">hotel</a>, I didn't work on my weblog infrastructure. I'm waiting to see what comes next from <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">blogX</a>. With Chris and <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/">Don</a> working on it, my time is better spent in other places. I did build a tool to download my weblog entries and store them in a single XML file on my local system. Even converts from HTML to XHTML via <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=B90FDDCE-E60D-43F8-A5C4-C3BD760564BC"> SgmlReader</a>. So I'm ready to migrate to something else.</p><p>Since I'm not building blog tools, I spent my hotel evening last night with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/preview/overview_wss.asp">Windows SharePoint Services</a> (WSS). The more I play with this product, the more impressed I am with it. One of the features of WSS is the ability to be notified via email when something changes (a doc, a folder, a list, etc). Of course, those of us in the blogsphere would rather have an RSS feed to tell when something changed. So I built an RSS feed generator for WSS. I will post it after it undergoes some basic smoke testing (I sent it to <a href="http://technovangelist.com/">Matt</a> to see if he could get it to work). Since <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/preview/overview_sps.asp">Office SharePoint Portal Server</a> (SPS) is built on the same technology, it should work there as well (I asked Matt, who has an SPS up and running, to try this out too). </p><p>Finally, welcome <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/04/15.html#a2766">Robert Scoble</a> to MSFT. Interesting to see that he credits his weblog for helping him get hired. Glad to have you on board!</p>
