<p>I'm sitting in the back of the room listening to Jack present the Factories overview for the <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=141">DSL Tutorial</a>. I've seen most of the content for this session before, but not brought together like this. Currently, he's talking about mapping business capabilities to system requirements. I've started to see quite a bit of discussion of mapping business capabilities recently. Gurpreet <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7ab682e9-d93b-4b51-a0c9-b0eef792bd28">talked about it</a> in his EA session n Malaysia. Jack Calhoun also <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6a4515b1-5ebc-4187-991d-7bcb118df5ef">talked about it</a> at SAF. Memo to self - more transparency around business capability mapping.</p><p>BTW, check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/">Michael Lehman's blog</a>. Michael has been building (it's not really done) the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2004/10/16/243389.aspx">factories demo</a> for the tutorial. He's got some great points about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/09/23/233402.aspx">DSL's</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/09/27/234778.aspx">abstraction</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/10/03/237199.aspx">product lines</a>. As I type this, he's demoing expanding an e-commerce factory template inside of VS.NET. Cool stuff. I expect him to be blogging a lot more about building factories after this week.</p>
