I&#8217;ve started to see quite a bit of discussion of mapping business capabilities recently. Gurpreet <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7ab682e9-d93b-4b51-a0c9-b0eef792bd28\">talked about it<\/a> in his EA session n Malaysia. Jack Calhoun also <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6a4515b1-5ebc-4187-991d-7bcb118df5ef\">talked about it<\/a> at SAF. Memo to self &#8211; more transparency around business capability mapping.<\/p>\n<p>BTW, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mglehman\/\">Michael Lehman&#8217;s blog<\/a>. Michael has been building (it&#8217;s not really done) the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/keith_short\/archive\/2004\/10\/16\/243389.aspx\">factories demo<\/a> for the tutorial. He&#8217;s got some great points about <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mglehman\/archive\/2004\/09\/23\/233402.aspx\">DSL&#8217;s<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mglehman\/archive\/2004\/09\/27\/234778.aspx\">abstraction<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mglehman\/archive\/2004\/10\/03\/237199.aspx\">product lines<\/a>. As I type this, he&#8217;s demoing expanding an e-commerce factory template inside of VS.NET. Cool stuff. I expect him to be blogging a lot more about building factories after this week.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m sitting in the back of the room listening to Jack present the Factories overview for the DSL Tutorial.
