If you&#8217;re not a gamer, please move along, nothing to see here. Also note, I work @ Microsoft, but not in the games division so this is only my thoughts on yesterday&#8217;s announcements.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>While several &#8220;hard-core&#8221; games were showcased &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/fallout3\/\">Fallout 3<\/a>, Resident Evil 5, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/fable2\/\">Fable 2<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/gearsofwar2\/\">Gears of War 2<\/a> and the surprise announcement that Final Fantasy XIII &#8211; the rest of yesterday&#8217;s briefing screamed &#8220;we&#8217;re not just for hard core gamers!&#8221;\u00a0 Call it the Wii effect. Even the title of the main E3 Press Release was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/community\/events\/e32008\/articles\/0714-gamesall.htm\">Gameplay for Every Passion<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Honestly, my favorite announcement from yesterday wasn&#8217;t game related at all &#8211; it was the announcement of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/community\/events\/e32008\/articles\/0714-netflixteamup.htm\">Netflix on Xbox 360<\/a>. I&#8217;ve been <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/11\/24\/Hawkeye+On+XBL+Video+Marketplace.aspx\">hoping for a flat rate subscription plan<\/a> since Video Marketplace first launched. Soon, I&#8217;ll have it. <\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m not sure what I think of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/NR\/rdonlyres\/BE004694-EDED-4077-BD82-6AD23014821F\/0\/vidNXEe30801LLHi.asx\">New Xbox Experience<\/a> yet. On the one hand, the whole cartoon avatar thing isn&#8217;t really my bag. Plus, isn&#8217;t it quite the Mii clone? However, the ability to share photo and video viewing experiences &#8211; even with cartoony avatars &#8211; and the flashy + engaging navigation mechanism looks like a real improvement. Here&#8217;s hoping they improve the performance of navigating hard drive content (games library, gamer pictures, etc).<\/li>\n<li>Congrats to my friend Matt who&#8217;s been very involved in the development of the new Primetime game show channel. I&#8217;m not that interested in &#8220;1 vs 100&#8243;, but I think the potential of that game model is pretty huge. If they created a Jeopardy game for Primetime, I think my parents would by a 360 right away. <\/li>\n<li>Music \/ party games seem to have been the primary focus of the press briefing. I&#8217;m definitely getting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/rockband2\/\">Rock Band 2<\/a> (AC\/DC woot!) and I think my wife would like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/lips\/\">Lips<\/a> (she usually sings when we play Rock Band). I want to see how the &#8220;wireless interactive microphones: Featuring stylish interactive motion sensors and lights&#8221; will work. Guitar Hero World Tour looks cool too, but I&#8217;m not re-buying all new music hardware.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/yitm\/\">You&#8217;re in the Movies<\/a> looks like a hoot, plus it doesn&#8217;t really look like a game, so much as a &#8220;party activity&#8221;. For example, while there are minigame winners or losers, &#8220;winning&#8221; takes a back seat to the final movie result. I&#8217;m guessing this will be big with the kids.<\/li>\n<li>Speaking of kids, Patrick is really looking forward to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/bknutsandbolts\/\">Banjo-Kazooie Nuts &amp; Bolts<\/a>. He loves anything related to building, and building fantastic vehicles is a core part of the gameplay. As for Riley, I think she&#8217;s getting old enough to enjoy Viva Pinata &#8211; she enjoys watching Patrick and I play &#8211; though I&#8217;m not sure we need the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/vptip\/\">new Viva Pinata<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/geowarsre2xboxlivearcade\/\">Geometry Wars 2<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/portalxboxlivearcade\/\">Portal: Still Alive<\/a>, both coming to Xbox Live Arcade. &#8217;nuff said.<\/li>\n<li>Not really &#8220;new&#8221; news, but <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.xna.com\/gamescatalog.aspx\">XNA Community Games<\/a> launches this fall. I&#8217;ve got a creators club membership, so I&#8217;m able to experiment with this now &#8211; it rocks, though the available games are pretty shall I say &#8220;unpolished&#8221; at this point.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/halowars\/\">Halo Wars<\/a> not coming until 2009. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_sad.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1153\" alt=\":(\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/li>\n<li>No new Bungie news, but their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bungie.net\/defaultsi.aspx\">website<\/a> is counting down to *something* tomorrow. I guess we&#8217;ll find out then. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Yesterday, was Microsoft&#8217;s big reveal for Xbox 360 this coming holiday season.
