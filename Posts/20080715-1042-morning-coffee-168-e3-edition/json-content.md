Yesterday, was [Microsoft’s big
reveal](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/) for Xbox 360
this coming holiday season. If you’re not a gamer, please move along,
nothing to see here. Also note, I work @ Microsoft, but not in the games
division so this is only my thoughts on yesterday’s announcements.

-   While several “hard-core” games were showcased – [Fallout
    3](http://www.xbox.com/games/fallout3/), Resident Evil 5, [Fable
    2](http://www.xbox.com/games/fable2/), [Gears of War
    2](http://www.xbox.com/games/gearsofwar2/) and the surprise
    announcement that Final Fantasy XIII – the rest of yesterday’s
    briefing screamed “we’re not just for hard core gamers!”  Call it
    the Wii effect. Even the title of the main E3 Press Release was
    [Gameplay for Every
    Passion](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/articles/0714-gamesall.htm).
-   Honestly, my favorite announcement from yesterday wasn’t game
    related at all – it was the announcement of [Netflix on Xbox
    360](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/articles/0714-netflixteamup.htm).
    I’ve been [hoping for a flat rate subscription
    plan](http://devhawk.net/2006/11/24/Hawkeye+On+XBL+Video+Marketplace.aspx)
    since Video Marketplace first launched. Soon, I’ll have it.
-   I’m not sure what I think of the [New Xbox
    Experience](http://www.xbox.com/NR/rdonlyres/BE004694-EDED-4077-BD82-6AD23014821F/0/vidNXEe30801LLHi.asx)
    yet. On the one hand, the whole cartoon avatar thing isn’t really my
    bag. Plus, isn’t it quite the Mii clone? However, the ability to
    share photo and video viewing experiences – even with cartoony
    avatars – and the flashy + engaging navigation mechanism looks like
    a real improvement. Here’s hoping they improve the performance of
    navigating hard drive content (games library, gamer pictures, etc).
-   Congrats to my friend Matt who’s been very involved in the
    development of the new Primetime game show channel. I’m not that
    interested in “1 vs 100″, but I think the potential of that game
    model is pretty huge. If they created a Jeopardy game for Primetime,
    I think my parents would by a 360 right away.
-   Music / party games seem to have been the primary focus of the press
    briefing. I’m definitely getting [Rock Band
    2](http://www.xbox.com/games/rockband2/) (AC/DC woot!) and I think
    my wife would like [Lips](http://www.xbox.com/games/lips/) (she
    usually sings when we play Rock Band). I want to see how the
    “wireless interactive microphones: Featuring stylish interactive
    motion sensors and lights” will work. Guitar Hero World Tour looks
    cool too, but I’m not re-buying all new music hardware.
-   [You’re in the Movies](http://www.xbox.com/games/yitm/) looks like a
    hoot, plus it doesn’t really look like a game, so much as a “party
    activity”. For example, while there are minigame winners or losers,
    “winning” takes a back seat to the final movie result. I’m guessing
    this will be big with the kids.
-   Speaking of kids, Patrick is really looking forward to
    [Banjo-Kazooie Nuts &
    Bolts](http://www.xbox.com/games/bknutsandbolts/). He loves anything
    related to building, and building fantastic vehicles is a core part
    of the gameplay. As for Riley, I think she’s getting old enough to
    enjoy Viva Pinata – she enjoys watching Patrick and I play – though
    I’m not sure we need the [new Viva
    Pinata](http://www.xbox.com/games/vptip/).
-   [Geometry Wars
    2](http://www.xbox.com/games/geowarsre2xboxlivearcade/) and [Portal:
    Still Alive](http://www.xbox.com/games/portalxboxlivearcade/), both
    coming to Xbox Live Arcade. ’nuff said.
-   Not really “new” news, but [XNA Community
    Games](http://catalog.xna.com/gamescatalog.aspx) launches this fall.
    I’ve got a creators club membership, so I’m able to experiment with
    this now – it rocks, though the available games are pretty shall I
    say “unpolished” at this point.
-   [Halo Wars](http://www.xbox.com/games/halowars/) not coming until
    2009.
    ![:(](http://devhawk.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif)
-   No new Bungie news, but their
    [website](http://www.bungie.net/defaultsi.aspx) is counting down
    to \*something\* tomorrow. I guess we’ll find out then.
