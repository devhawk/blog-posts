<p>Yesterday, was <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/">Microsoft&#8217;s big reveal</a> for Xbox 360 this coming holiday season. If you&#8217;re not a gamer, please move along, nothing to see here. Also note, I work @ Microsoft, but not in the games division so this is only my thoughts on yesterday&#8217;s announcements.</p>
<ul>
<li>While several &#8220;hard-core&#8221; games were showcased &#8211; <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/fallout3/">Fallout 3</a>, Resident Evil 5, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/fable2/">Fable 2</a>, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/gearsofwar2/">Gears of War 2</a> and the surprise announcement that Final Fantasy XIII &#8211; the rest of yesterday&#8217;s briefing screamed &#8220;we&#8217;re not just for hard core gamers!&#8221;&nbsp; Call it the Wii effect. Even the title of the main E3 Press Release was <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/articles/0714-gamesall.htm">Gameplay for Every Passion</a>.</li>
<li>Honestly, my favorite announcement from yesterday wasn&#8217;t game related at all &#8211; it was the announcement of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/articles/0714-netflixteamup.htm">Netflix on Xbox 360</a>. I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/11/24/Hawkeye+On+XBL+Video+Marketplace.aspx">hoping for a flat rate subscription plan</a> since Video Marketplace first launched. Soon, I&#8217;ll have it. </li>
<li>I&#8217;m not sure what I think of the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/NR/rdonlyres/BE004694-EDED-4077-BD82-6AD23014821F/0/vidNXEe30801LLHi.asx">New Xbox Experience</a> yet. On the one hand, the whole cartoon avatar thing isn&#8217;t really my bag. Plus, isn&#8217;t it quite the Mii clone? However, the ability to share photo and video viewing experiences &#8211; even with cartoony avatars &#8211; and the flashy + engaging navigation mechanism looks like a real improvement. Here&#8217;s hoping they improve the performance of navigating hard drive content (games library, gamer pictures, etc).</li>
<li>Congrats to my friend Matt who&#8217;s been very involved in the development of the new Primetime game show channel. I&#8217;m not that interested in &#8220;1 vs 100&#8243;, but I think the potential of that game model is pretty huge. If they created a Jeopardy game for Primetime, I think my parents would by a 360 right away. </li>
<li>Music / party games seem to have been the primary focus of the press briefing. I&#8217;m definitely getting <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/rockband2/">Rock Band 2</a> (AC/DC woot!) and I think my wife would like <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/lips/">Lips</a> (she usually sings when we play Rock Band). I want to see how the &#8220;wireless interactive microphones: Featuring stylish interactive motion sensors and lights&#8221; will work. Guitar Hero World Tour looks cool too, but I&#8217;m not re-buying all new music hardware.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/yitm/">You&#8217;re in the Movies</a> looks like a hoot, plus it doesn&#8217;t really look like a game, so much as a &#8220;party activity&#8221;. For example, while there are minigame winners or losers, &#8220;winning&#8221; takes a back seat to the final movie result. I&#8217;m guessing this will be big with the kids.</li>
<li>Speaking of kids, Patrick is really looking forward to <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bknutsandbolts/">Banjo-Kazooie Nuts &amp; Bolts</a>. He loves anything related to building, and building fantastic vehicles is a core part of the gameplay. As for Riley, I think she&#8217;s getting old enough to enjoy Viva Pinata &#8211; she enjoys watching Patrick and I play &#8211; though I&#8217;m not sure we need the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/vptip/">new Viva Pinata</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/geowarsre2xboxlivearcade/">Geometry Wars 2</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/portalxboxlivearcade/">Portal: Still Alive</a>, both coming to Xbox Live Arcade. &#8217;nuff said.</li>
<li>Not really &#8220;new&#8221; news, but <a href="http://catalog.xna.com/gamescatalog.aspx">XNA Community Games</a> launches this fall. I&#8217;ve got a creators club membership, so I&#8217;m able to experiment with this now &#8211; it rocks, though the available games are pretty shall I say &#8220;unpolished&#8221; at this point.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/halowars/">Halo Wars</a> not coming until 2009. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_sad.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group1153" alt=":("> </li>
<li>No new Bungie news, but their <a href="http://www.bungie.net/defaultsi.aspx">website</a> is counting down to *something* tomorrow. I guess we&#8217;ll find out then. </li>
</ul>
