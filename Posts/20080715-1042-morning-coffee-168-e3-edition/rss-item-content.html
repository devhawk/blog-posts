<p>Yesterday, was <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/">Microsoft's big reveal</a> for Xbox 360 this coming holiday season. If you're not a gamer, please move along, nothing to see here. Also note, I work @ Microsoft, but not in the games division so this is only my thoughts on yesterday's announcements.</p><ul><li>While several "hard-core" games were showcased - <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/fallout3/">Fallout 3</a>, Resident Evil 5, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/fable2/">Fable 2</a>, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/gearsofwar2/">Gears of War 2</a> and the surprise announcement that Final Fantasy XIII - the rest of yesterday's briefing screamed "we're not just for hard core gamers!"  Call it the Wii effect. Even the title of the main E3 Press Release was <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/articles/0714-gamesall.htm">Gameplay for Every Passion</a>.</li><li>Honestly, my favorite announcement from yesterday wasn't game related at all - it was the announcement of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/articles/0714-netflixteamup.htm">Netflix on Xbox 360</a>. I've been <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/11/24/Hawkeye+On+XBL+Video+Marketplace.aspx">hoping for a flat rate subscription plan</a> since Video Marketplace first launched. Soon, I'll have it. </li><li>I'm not sure what I think of the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/NR/rdonlyres/BE004694-EDED-4077-BD82-6AD23014821F/0/vidNXEe30801LLHi.asx">New Xbox Experience</a> yet. On the one hand, the whole cartoon avatar thing isn't really my bag. Plus, isn't it quite the Mii clone? However, the ability to share photo and video viewing experiences - even with cartoony avatars - and the flashy + engaging navigation mechanism looks like a real improvement. Here's hoping they improve the performance of navigating hard drive content (games library, gamer pictures, etc).</li><li>Congrats to my friend Matt who's been very involved in the development of the new Primetime game show channel. I'm not that interested in "1 vs 100", but I think the potential of that game model is pretty huge. If they created a Jeopardy game for Primetime, I think my parents would by a 360 right away. </li><li>Music / party games seem to have been the primary focus of the press briefing. I'm definitely getting <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/rockband2/">Rock Band 2</a> (AC/DC woot!) and I think my wife would like <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/lips/">Lips</a> (she usually sings when we play Rock Band). I want to see how the "wireless interactive microphones: Featuring stylish interactive motion sensors and lights" will work. Guitar Hero World Tour looks cool too, but I'm not re-buying all new music hardware.</li><li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/yitm/">You're in the Movies</a> looks like a hoot, plus it doesn't really look like a game, so much as a "party activity". For example, while there are minigame winners or losers, "winning" takes a back seat to the final movie result. I'm guessing this will be big with the kids.</li><li>Speaking of kids, Patrick is really looking forward to <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bknutsandbolts/">Banjo-Kazooie Nuts &amp; Bolts</a>. He loves anything related to building, and building fantastic vehicles is a core part of the gameplay. As for Riley, I think she's getting old enough to enjoy Viva Pinata - she enjoys watching Patrick and I play - though I'm not sure we need the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/vptip/">new Viva Pinata</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/geowarsre2xboxlivearcade/">Geometry Wars 2</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/portalxboxlivearcade/">Portal: Still Alive</a>, both coming to Xbox Live Arcade. 'nuff said.</li><li>Not really "new" news, but <a href="http://catalog.xna.com/gamescatalog.aspx">XNA Community Games</a> launches this fall. I've got a creators club membership, so I'm able to experiment with this now - it rocks, though the available games are pretty shall I say "unpolished" at this point.</li><li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/halowars/">Halo Wars</a> not coming until 2009. :(</li><li>No new Bungie news, but their <a href="http://www.bungie.net/defaultsi.aspx">website</a> is counting down to *something* tomorrow. I guess we'll find out then. </li></ul>
