I loved this morning’s keynote on research. I saw the
[SkyServer](http://skyserver.sdss.org) stuff @ an internal research
event last year. Coolest part: you can
[download](http://skyserver.org/myskyserver/) a slice of the database
and run it locally. [Jim Gray](http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/) is
sitting on the floor behind me as I blog talking about SkyServer
futures. Don just finished his session Indigo and the Future of
Distributed Computing. I guess Jim couldn’t get a seat for that.

A couple of people jumped on Don after the talk to discuss transactions
across services. This is a bad bad bad idea. For those @ PDC, come to
the architecture symposium tomorrow in room 152/153. My job is to
connect with the architect community so come get my [business
card](PermaLink.aspx?guid=ed18a54c-d8dd-4a81-80be-e5e976de78ba).
