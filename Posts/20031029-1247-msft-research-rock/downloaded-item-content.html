<p>I loved this morning&#8217;s keynote on research. I saw the <a href="http://skyserver.sdss.org">SkyServer</a> stuff @ an internal research event last year. Coolest part: you can <a href="http://skyserver.org/myskyserver/">download</a> a slice of the database and run it locally. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/">Jim Gray</a> is sitting on the floor behind me as I blog talking about SkyServer futures. Don just finished his session Indigo and the Future of Distributed Computing. I guess Jim couldn&#8217;t get a seat for that. </p>
<p>A couple of people jumped on Don after the talk to discuss transactions across services. This is a bad bad bad idea. For those @ PDC, come to the architecture symposium tomorrow in room 152/153. My job is to connect with the architect community so come get my <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=ed18a54c-d8dd-4a81-80be-e5e976de78ba">business card</a>. </p>
