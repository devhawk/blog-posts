<p>For TechEd, we got a big banner to hang in the lunch room to advertise <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture">Architecture Center</a>. When we got it back, we hung it in the atrium of building 18 &#8211; our new home. Looks pretty cool, doesn&#8217;t it? In the pic, from left to right, are my boss Adam Denning, yours truly (in desperate need of a haircut) and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados">John deVadoss</a>. Massive thanks to Richard and Megan who got the banner hung in the first place.</p>
