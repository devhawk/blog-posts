For TechEd, we got a big banner to hang in the lunch room to advertise
[Architecture Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture). When we
got it back, we hung it in the atrium of building 18 – our new home.
Looks pretty cool, doesn’t it? In the pic, from left to right, are my
boss Adam Denning, yours truly (in desperate need of a haircut) and
[John deVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados). Massive thanks to
Richard and Megan who got the banner hung in the first place.
