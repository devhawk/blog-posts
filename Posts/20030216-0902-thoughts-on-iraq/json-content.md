In September, President Bush claimed the UN [runs the risk of becoming
irrelevant if it fails to
act](http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/09/14/iraq.bush.berlusconi/). Today,
Condoleezza Rice claimed that the UN Security Council is “[getting a
history of being unable to
react](http://www.msnbc.com/news/842500.asp)“. But in the face
[worldwide protests](http://www.msnbc.com/news/872342.asp), many of
which are targeted not at America but directly at [Bush and his
Administration](http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/02/15/btsc.bitterman/index.html),
I can’t help but wonder about the risks the US is taking and how history
will view Bush. I found [Senator Robert Byrd’s
speech](http://www.counterpunch.org/byrd02132003.html) [from [KeithBa’s
Blog](http://www.keithba.net/blog/)] put my thoughts and feelings into
words. It’s amazing the damage that has been done to this great nation
in such a short time but such a short-sighted President. I agree with
[David Weller](http://www.inkblog.com/2003/02/16.html#a28) regarding
Hussein’s need for an ass-kicking, but that’s not for the US alone to
decide.

What does it say about Bush that he claims that Iraq is in “material
breach” of UN Security Council resolutions (which they are, IMO), but is
willing to go to war with Iraq without the sanction of that very
organization?
