One of the very few annoying things about ASP.NET is that there is no
convenient binary in which to store CLR version metadata for side by
side execution. Therefore, you have to use the command line
ASPNET\_REGIIS utility. Or at least, you had to until Denis Bauer built
the [ASP.NET Version Switcher
utility](http://dbauer.homeip.net/NETTools/ASPNETVersionSwitcher.aspx).
Iâ€™ve added it to my tool list.
