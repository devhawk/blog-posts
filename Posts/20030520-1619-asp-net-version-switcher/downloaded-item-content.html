<p>One of the very few annoying things about ASP.NET is that there is no convenient binary in which to store CLR version metadata for side by side execution. Therefore, you have to use the command line ASPNET_REGIIS utility. Or at least, you had to until Denis Bauer built the <a href="http://dbauer.homeip.net/NETTools/ASPNETVersionSwitcher.aspx">ASP.NET Version Switcher utility</a>. I&#8217;ve added it to my tool list.</p>
