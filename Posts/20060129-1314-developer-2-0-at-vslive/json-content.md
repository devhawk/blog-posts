FYI, for those going to [<span class="misspell">VSLive</span>! in San
Francisco](http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/sf/ "VSLive! in San Francisco"),
I’m a last minute addition to the schedule. I’m presenting a talk titled
<span id="transformationbest"></span>[Developer 2.0: Finding Your Way in
the Future of Software
Development](http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/sf/sas-sessions.aspx#transformationbest "Developer 2.0: Finding Your Way in the Future of Software Development").
I wrote and delivered this presentation originally for the [patterns &
practices
Summit](http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2005X.aspx "patterns &amp; practices Summit")
back in December. It was the second-highest rated talk of the summit
(after Anders’ LINQ keynote) so I’m excited to be delivering it again.
I’m hoping to get a high-quality recording so I can publish it (I
recorded the p&p summit version with my laptop. You can hear it but I
wouldn’t say it’s “high quality”). The session is at 5:45pm on Tuesday.
I’ve been told it’s in room 2016/2018, but you should double check when
you get there if you’re interested in going.

There’s a solid showing from the Architecture Strategy Team at the
VSLive! [Software Architecture

    .
