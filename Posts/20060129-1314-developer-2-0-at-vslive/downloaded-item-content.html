<p>FYI, for those going to <a title="VSLive! in San Francisco" href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/sf/"><span class="misspell">VSLive</span>! in San Francisco</a>, I&#8217;m a last minute addition to the schedule. I&#8217;m presenting a talk titled <a id="transformationbest" name="transformationbest"></a><a title="Developer 2.0: Finding Your Way in the Future of Software Development" href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/sf/sas-sessions.aspx#transformationbest">Developer 2.0: Finding Your Way in the Future of Software Development</a>. I wrote and delivered this presentation originally for the <a title="patterns &amp; practices Summit" href="http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2005X.aspx">patterns &amp; practices Summit</a> back in December. It was the second-highest rated talk of the summit (after Anders&#8217; LINQ keynote) so I&#8217;m excited to be delivering it again. I&#8217;m hoping to get a high-quality recording so I can publish it (I recorded the p&amp;p summit version with my laptop. You can hear it but I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s &#8220;high quality&#8221;). The session is at 5:45pm on Tuesday. I&#8217;ve been told it&#8217;s in room 2016/2018, but you should double check when you get there if you&#8217;re interested in going. </p>
