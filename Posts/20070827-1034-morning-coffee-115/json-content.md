-   Scott Guthrie has two new posts in his series on LINQ to SQL. [The
    first](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/08/23/linq-to-sql-part-7-updating-our-database-using-stored-procedures.aspx)
    covers updating the database using stored procs instead of dynamic
    SQL. I was somewhat surprised that there wasn’t the capability to
    auto-generate vanilla Insert, Update and Deleted procs, but I guess
    DBA’s probably hate that anyway. [The
    second](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/08/27/linq-to-sql-part-8-executing-custom-sql-expressions.aspx)
    shows how to use ExecuteQuery to execute arbitrary SQL instead of
    using the cool LINQ query syntax. I’m doing a bunch of loosely-typed
    SQL work right now, so I’m going to take a deeper look at this.
-   Speaking of LINQ, I just discovered this [great
    series](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2007/04/05/the-iqueryable-tales-linq-to-ldap-part-0.aspx)
    on IQueriable by Bart De Smet. It’s four months old, but takes an
    incredibly detailed look at what happens under the hood with LINQ.
    Bart also has a [reference
    implementation](http://www.codeplex.com/LINQSQO) of LINQ’s standard
    query operators as well as [LINQ to
    Sharepoint](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/linqtosharepoint/default.aspx).
-   Dan Maharry has pulled together what looks like [the definitive
    guide](http://blogs.ipona.com/dan/archive/2007/08/22/8419.aspx) for
    really slimming down and speeding up your VPC. It’s XP specific, but
    I’d bet most of the guidance would also apply to WS03, which is what
    I mostly use in my VPCs. (via

    [thinks](http://jimmynilsson.com/blog/posts/PowerBalance.htm) it’s
    the operations department that holds the power in today’s IT world.
    I agree 100% That’s why I value
    [Dale’s](halfmybrain.spaces.live.com) input so much.

    [wonders](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/08/24/is-it-time-to-bring-the-fea-concepts-to-the-commercial-space.aspx)
    if it’s time to translate the [Federal Enterprise
    Architecture](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/egov/a-2-EAModelsNEW2.html)
    for use in the commercial sector. My dad just retired from 5 years
    in the [FAA](http://www.faa.gov/) and he thinks FEA is too high
    level to be particularly useful.
-   The [2007
    edition](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/147518722/ScottHanselmans2007UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx)
    version of [Scott Hanselman’s ultimate tool
    list](http://www.hanselman.com/tools) is now available.
-   A bunch of [XNA Gamefest
    sessions](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/xna/aa937787.aspx) are
    now available for on-demand viewing.
