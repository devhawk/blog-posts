Last week was [Mix09](http://live.visitmix.com/), Microsoft’s annual
conference for web development and design. There were some big
announcements – [Silverlight 3
Beta](http://silverlight.net/getstarted/silverlight3/default.aspx),
[ASP.NET MVC
RTM](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/03/18/aspnet-mvc-rtw.aspx), [TDS
support for SQL Data
Services](http://blogs.msdn.com/ssds/archive/2009/03/10/9469228.aspx),
new drops of
[Azure](http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsazure/archive/2009/03/18/windows-azure-delivers-new-ctp-capabilities.aspx)
and
[LiveFX](http://blogs.msdn.com/liveframework/archive/2009/03/11/live-framework-updated.aspx)
SDKs and I’m sure a bunch of other things that I’ve forgotten.

Of course, by far the most important thing that shipped at Mix09 was
[IronRuby
0.3](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/53552/ironruby-0.3.0.zip).

Jimmy has [the
details](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/jimmy-thinking/~3/ygbSDcv9_AU/ironruby-03-released.html)
on the new release and John Lam [did a talk at
Mix](sessions.visitmix.com/MIX09/T22F) on dynamic languages in
Silverlight. I haven’t seen an announcement, but it also looks like
there’s a new version of [AgDLR](http://github.com/jschementi/agdlr/) –
aka the [Silverlight Dynamic Languages SDK](http://sdlsdk.codeplex.com/)
– as well.
