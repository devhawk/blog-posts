<p>After introducing myself at a customer meeting today in Phoenix, someone asked &#8220;Are you the Harry Pierson from DevHawk?&#8221;. First time that&#8217;s happened &#8211; kinda cool. Nice that he recognized my real name &#8211; I think most people who read this blog just know me as &#8220;DevHawk&#8221;. A couple of times, I&#8217;ve introduced myself to blank stares then mention that I write DevHawk to instant recognititon. </p>
<p>BTW, I did take the <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/mgudgin/default.aspx">plunge</a> and put the URL for my blog on my business cards.</p>
