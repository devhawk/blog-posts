<p>Last week, Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/nov04/11-05MovieListingsPR.asp">announced</a> the new <a href="http://www.msndirect.com/channel/Movies.htm">Movies channel</a> for <a href="http://www.msndirect.com/default.htm">SPOT Watches</a>. I <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=db80c369-3d4b-41f7-bae3-91cce37df11c">blogged</a> a while ago about wanting movie times on my SmartPhone. On my watch is nearly as good, except that I don't have said watch. I've been thinking about getting a SPOT watch, but I'm curious - why can't I get <a href="http://www.msndirect.com/channel/default.htm">MSN Direct content</a> delivered to my device of choice? I'd be happy to pay a service fee - I've just gotten used to not wearing a watch.</p>
