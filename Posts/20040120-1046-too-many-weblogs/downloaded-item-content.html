<p>I posted yesterday that I&#8217;m reading over 200 blogs these days. Those aren&#8217;t Scoble numbers (is he over 700 yet?) but there sure is a lot of noise. It reminds me of when I first joined Microsoft &#8211; there was so much information available and I wanted to read it all. So I went through several cycles of signing up for a bunch of distribution lists, getting to the point where I wasn&#8217;t really reading them, then removing myself. I think I&#8217;m at that point for reading&nbsp;blogs.<!--?namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" ?--><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve cut my list of feeds down to just 20 technical bloggers, though 6 of them are .NEAT teammates or architect evangelists in the field. I&#8217;ve also subscribed to a bunch of community feeds, the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/rss.xml">main MSDN feed</a> and the <a href="http://www.thundermain.com/rss/">MSFT Download Center feed</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t plan on keeping my list of bloggers this low. 20 just seemed like a nice round number to start. There is so much interlinking that with the 20 I picked, I feel that I&#8217;ll still find out about the important posts without having to read so many entries. I do know that I&#8217;ll subscribe to any teammate or field AE who starts blogging, because I like to keep up on what they&#8217;re blogging about. I think that for other new blogs, I&#8217;m going to create a &#8220;tentative&#8221; category. Then I can get a feel for the blog before deciding to keep them. Of course, I can delete feeds anytime, but having a tentative category helps remind me of my level of commitment to reading the blog. </p>
