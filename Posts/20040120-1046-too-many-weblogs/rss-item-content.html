<p>I posted yesterday that I'm reading over 200 blogs these days. Those aren't Scoble numbers (is he over 700 yet?) but there sure is a lot of noise. It reminds me of when I first joined Microsoft - there was so much information available and I wanted to read it all. So I went through several cycles of signing up for a bunch of distribution lists, getting to the point where I wasn't really reading them, then removing myself. I think I'm at that point for reading blogs.<?namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" ?><o:p xmlns:o="#unknown"></o:p></p><p>I've cut my list of feeds down to just 20 technical bloggers, though 6 of them are .NEAT teammates or architect evangelists in the field. I’ve also subscribed to a bunch of community feeds, the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/rss.xml">main MSDN feed</a> and the <a href="http://www.thundermain.com/rss/">MSFT Download Center feed</a>. </p><p>I don’t plan on keeping my list of bloggers this low. 20 just seemed like a nice round number to start. There is so much interlinking that with the 20 I picked, I feel that I'll still find out about the important posts without having to read so many entries. I do know that I’ll subscribe to any teammate or field AE who starts blogging, because I like to keep up on what they’re blogging about. I think that for other new blogs, I’m going to create a “tentative” category. Then I can get a feel for the blog before deciding to keep them. Of course, I can delete feeds anytime, but having a tentative category helps remind me of my level of commitment to reading the blog. </p>
