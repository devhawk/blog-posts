Those aren&#8217;t Scoble numbers (is he over 700 yet?) but there sure is a lot of noise. It reminds me of when I first joined Microsoft &#8211; there was so much information available and I wanted to read it all. So I went through several cycles of signing up for a bunch of distribution lists, getting to the point where I wasn&#8217;t really reading them, then removing myself. I think I&#8217;m at that point for reading\u00a0blogs.<?namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ?><o:p xmlns:o=\"#unknown\"><\/o:p><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve cut my list of feeds down to just 20 technical bloggers, though 6 of them are .NEAT teammates or architect evangelists in the field. I\u2019ve also subscribed to a bunch of community feeds, the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/rss.xml\">main MSDN feed<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thundermain.com\/rss\/\">MSFT Download Center feed<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t plan on keeping my list of bloggers this low. 20 just seemed like a nice round number to start. There is so much interlinking that with the 20 I picked, I feel that I&#8217;ll still find out about the important posts without having to read so many entries. I do know that I\u2019ll subscribe to any teammate or field AE who starts blogging, because I like to keep up on what they\u2019re blogging about. I think that for other new blogs, I\u2019m going to create a \u201ctentative\u201d category. Then I can get a feel for the blog before deciding to keep them. Of course, I can delete feeds anytime, but having a tentative category helps remind me of my level of commitment to reading the blog. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I posted yesterday that I&#8217;m reading over 200 blogs these days.
