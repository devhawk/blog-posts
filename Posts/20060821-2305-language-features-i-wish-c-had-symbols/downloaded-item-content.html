<p>Ruby&#8217;s symbols are <a href="http://wiki.rubygarden.org/Ruby/page/show/UnderstandingSymbols">often talked about</a> in terms of efficiency &#8211; taking up less memory and executing faster. While these are both laudable goals, symbols are more than just performance improvers. The ability to name things is valuable semantically. Take a look thru p&amp;p&#8217;s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/CAB.asp">Composite UI AppBlock</a> and you&#8217;ll see strings used as names for things all over the place. It&#8217;s great for loose coupling, you see. But how do you tell the difference between a string used as a name and a string used for some other reason like user input? You can&#8217;t. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a>&nbsp;makes extensive use of symbols &#8211; anyone who has <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html">Rolled on Rails</a> has seen &#8220;scaffold :recipe&#8221;. That&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg. Rails uses symbols extensively across both ActionPack and ActiveRecord (and probably others I&#8217;m not familiar with). It&#8217;s a great approach, but one that&#8217;s unique to Ruby as far as I&#8217;m aware.</p>
