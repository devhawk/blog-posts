<p>As I write various python modules (many of which get blogged about), I dump them into a special folder on my machine(s). In my powershell profile script, I set the <a href="http://www.ironpython.info/index.php/Using_the_Python_Standard_Library">IRONPYTHONPATH environment variable</a> so that these modules are available to the IPy interpreter (i.e. ipy.exe). To date, I’ve been pretty haphazard about this. But I decided to get a little more structured and put that folder under source control and make it available as “<a href="http://github.com/devhawk/devhawk_ipy/tree">devhawk_ipy</a>”.</p><p>So far, I’ve only got three scripts (plus an empty __init__.py) in devhawk_ipy. </p><ul><li>codedom.py (from <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/01/30/IronPython+And+CodeDOM+Dynamically+Compiling+C+Files.aspx">IronPython and CodeDOM: Dynamically Compiling C# Files</a>)</li><li>ipypulldom.py (from <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/05/06/Stream+Processing+XML+In+IronPython.aspx">Stream Processing XML in IronPython</a>)</li><li>xml2py.py (from <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/05/07/Deserializing+XML+With+IronPython.aspx">Deserializing XML with IronPython</a>)</li></ul><p>Eventually I’ll put my code for working with <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/11/13/IronPython+And+WPF+Part+1+Introduction.aspx">WPF</a>, <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/12/13/IronPython+And+LiveFX+Accessing+Profiles.aspx">LiveFX</a> and <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/01/07/Nightly+Builds+Technical+Info.aspx">Azure</a> into this package, but I’m not happy with where they are yet. </p><p>Like ipydbg, devhawk_ipy is up on <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>. For those non-Git users, I’m will continue to these files up on <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/IronPython%20Stuff">my SkyDrive</a>. I kind of see SkyDrive as a dumping ground for random content while devhawk_ipy is where stuff goes when it’s a little more polished. </p><p>Like IronPython, devhawk_ipy is licensed under the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/opensource/licenses.mspx#Ms-PL">MS-PL</a>.
