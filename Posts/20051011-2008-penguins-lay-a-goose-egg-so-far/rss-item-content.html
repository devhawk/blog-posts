<p>It warms my heart that <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=251011021">Toronto</a> and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=251011019">St. Louis</a> both won tonight. That means the only team without a win in the NHL at the end of the first week is the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/clubhouse?team=pit">Penguins</a>. I can hear <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/">John</a> groaning as I type. And Pittsburg doesn't play again until Saturday, so I can <a href="http://www.jimrome.com/home/jungle/smacktionary.html">run smack</a> at him all week. </p>
