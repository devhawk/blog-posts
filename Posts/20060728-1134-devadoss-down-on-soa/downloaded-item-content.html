<p>My <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/michael_platt">old boss&#8217;s</a><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados">boss</a> seems like he was in a downer mood yesterday. First, he blogged about the &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2006/07/27/680756.aspx">Myth of Reuse in SOA</a>&#8220;, then the &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2006/07/27/680765.aspx">Achilles Heel of SOA</a>&#8220;. Actually, truth be told, I agree with him on both counts. </p>
<p>I slam the door on the reuse argument every time it comes up in my new job. Actually, I slam the door on what I call &#8220;Naive Reuse&#8221;. When John talks&nbsp;factoring for agility, he&#8217;s talking about a form of reuse &#8211; similar to how use &#8220;reuse&#8221; code when you refactor. What does it mean to refactor service? How about refactoring your enterprise?</p>
<p>As for the Achilles Heel &#8220;data problem&#8221;, I think that&#8217;s an artifact of the prevailing stateless request/response mindset most people have about services that I <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Devhawk/~3/6182983/Services+Arent+Stateless.aspx">touched on</a> yesterday. I think Pat Helland <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/dataoutsideinside.asp">described</a> a very good approach for dealing with data in an SOA, but I haven&#8217;t seen it implemented broadly. Rest assured, many of the concepts Pat described are at the forefront of my thinking as my new project takes shape.</p>
