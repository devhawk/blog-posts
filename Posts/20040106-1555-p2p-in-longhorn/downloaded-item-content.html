<p>I realized I wasn&#8217;t going into the office today @ 6am. My wife&#8217;s school called to let us know school was canceled. Given how hard it has been to get my email all day, I&#8217;m guessing I&#8217;m not the only one. Since I&#8217;m not at work or doing email, I figured I&#8217;d mess around with my new <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=37984176-3b89-4de2-9c34-40afa8c0b99a">Longhorn machine</a>.</p>
<p>I noticed browsing through the samples that Longhorn has a <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/system.net.peertopeer.aspx">managed P2P API</a>. The PDC build only supports PNRP and identities, which means you can&#8217;t acually communicate with another machine via P2P (yet), but it&#8217;s nice to see that it exists. </p>
