I’m guessing someone blogged it last week (I gave up on catching up on
blogs since I was almost three weeks behind), but there’s now a [free
home edition](http://www.altova.com/support_freexmlspyhome.asp) of
[xmlspy](http://www.altova.com/products_ide.html). Many of the cool
[features](http://www.altova.com/matrix_x.html), including the schema
editor, are available. However, the web services support, primarily the
[WSDL editor](http://www.altova.com/features_wsdl.html), remain only a
part of the enterprise edition.

I keep wondering if someone in the community will build a WSDL editor
with [VSIP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/extend/), esp. one that
supports WSDL [1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-wsdl-20010315) and
[2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-wsdl20-20040326). I know CapeClear
has their [WSDL editor](http://www.capescience.com/soa/index.shtml), but
I find the explorer style view much less usable than the xmlspy-style
graphical view.
