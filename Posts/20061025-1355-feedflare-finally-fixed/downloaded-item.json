FeedFlares &#8220;build interactivity into each post&#8221; with little links like &#8220;Digg this&#8221;, &#8220;Email this&#8221; or &#8220;Add to del.icio.us&#8221;. Since FeedBurner is serving the XML feed, it&#8217;s no big deal for them to add those links into the RSS feed. But to get those same flares to work on the web site, you have to embed a little script at the end of each item. Scott <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/AddingFeedBurnerFeedFlareToDasBlog.aspx\">shows how to do this<\/a> with DasBlog, except that it didn&#8217;t work for me. I&#8217;ve tried off and on, but for some reason, the FeedBurner script file I was including was always empty. <\/p>\n<p>Then I noticed the other day that my post <a title=\"WorkflowQueueNames\" href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/10\/17\/WorkflowQueueNames.aspx\">WorkflowQueueNames<\/a>\u00a0had the flare&#8217;s on them. Hmm, why would that post work and none of the rest of mine work? Turns out that it works because there&#8217;s no spaces in the title. Unlike most of the rest of the DasBlog community, I&#8217;m using &#8216;+&#8217; for spaces in my permalinks, instead of removing them. So I get <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/FeedFlare+Finally+Fixed.aspx\">http:\/\/devhawk.net\/FeedFlare+Finally+Fixed.aspx<\/a> as the permalink url instead of <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/FeedFlareFinallyFixed.aspx\">http:\/\/devhawk.net\/FeedFlareFinallyFixed.aspx<\/a>. In fact, that feature is in DasBlog because I pushed for it (a fact <a href=\"http:\/\/www.computerzen.com\">Scott<\/a> reminded me of while I was troubleshooting this last night). And it was breaking the FeedFlares.<\/p>\n<p>The solution is to URL encode the &#8216;+&#8217;, which is %2B, in the FeedFlare script link. I created a custom macro, since I already had a <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/02\/11\/New+Devhawk+Design.aspx\">few custom macro&#8217;s<\/a> powering this site anyway, and now I get the FeedFlares on all my blog entries. I&#8217;ll also go update the DasBlog source, but creating a custom macro was both easier and less risky than patching the tree and upgrading everything. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I moved over to FeedBurner a while back.
