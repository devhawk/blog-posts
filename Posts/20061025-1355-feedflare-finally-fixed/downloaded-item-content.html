<p>I moved over to <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a> a while back. <a href="http://dasblog.info/">DasBlog</a> has great support for FeedBurner &#8211; all you do set your FeedBurner feed name in the DasBlog config and it handles the rest, including permanently redirecting your readers to the new feed.</p>
<p>However, I haven&#8217;t been able to make FeedFlares work today. FeedFlares &#8220;build interactivity into each post&#8221; with little links like &#8220;Digg this&#8221;, &#8220;Email this&#8221; or &#8220;Add to del.icio.us&#8221;. Since FeedBurner is serving the XML feed, it&#8217;s no big deal for them to add those links into the RSS feed. But to get those same flares to work on the web site, you have to embed a little script at the end of each item. Scott <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AddingFeedBurnerFeedFlareToDasBlog.aspx">shows how to do this</a> with DasBlog, except that it didn&#8217;t work for me. I&#8217;ve tried off and on, but for some reason, the FeedBurner script file I was including was always empty. </p>
<p>Then I noticed the other day that my post <a title="WorkflowQueueNames" href="http://devhawk.net/2006/10/17/WorkflowQueueNames.aspx">WorkflowQueueNames</a>&nbsp;had the flare&#8217;s on them. Hmm, why would that post work and none of the rest of mine work? Turns out that it works because there&#8217;s no spaces in the title. Unlike most of the rest of the DasBlog community, I&#8217;m using &#8216;+&#8217; for spaces in my permalinks, instead of removing them. So I get <a href="http://devhawk.net/FeedFlare+Finally+Fixed.aspx">http://devhawk.net/FeedFlare+Finally+Fixed.aspx</a> as the permalink url instead of <a href="http://devhawk.net/FeedFlareFinallyFixed.aspx">http://devhawk.net/FeedFlareFinallyFixed.aspx</a>. In fact, that feature is in DasBlog because I pushed for it (a fact <a href="http://www.computerzen.com">Scott</a> reminded me of while I was troubleshooting this last night). And it was breaking the FeedFlares.</p>
<p>The solution is to URL encode the &#8216;+&#8217;, which is %2B, in the FeedFlare script link. I created a custom macro, since I already had a <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/11/New+Devhawk+Design.aspx">few custom macro&#8217;s</a> powering this site anyway, and now I get the FeedFlares on all my blog entries. I&#8217;ll also go update the DasBlog source, but creating a custom macro was both easier and less risky than patching the tree and upgrading everything. </p>
