At the Phoenix MSDN User Group Tuesday night, I mentioned ASHX files in passing, but most of the audience hadn't encountered them. Based on the emails I got after the event, I decided to post an <a href="art_imagehandler.aspx"> article</a> about using ASHX files to retrieve images stored in a database to my site. I also decided to add an "<a href="articles.aspx">Articles</a>" section to put this and other articles like it in (I moved my Add #Region macro page into the articles section so the ASHX article wouldn't be alone).
