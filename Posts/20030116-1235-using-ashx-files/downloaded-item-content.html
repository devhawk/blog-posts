<p>At the Phoenix MSDN User Group Tuesday night, I mentioned ASHX files in passing, but most of the audience hadn&#8217;t encountered them. Based on the emails I got after the event, I decided to post an <a href="art_imagehandler.aspx"> article</a> about using ASHX files to retrieve images stored in a database to my site. I also decided to add an &#8220;<a href="articles.aspx">Articles</a>&#8221; section to put this and other articles like it in (I moved my Add #Region macro page into the articles section so the ASHX article wouldn&#8217;t be alone).</p>
