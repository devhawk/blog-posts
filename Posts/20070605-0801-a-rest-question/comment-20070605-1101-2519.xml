  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is the "Do you believe in  evolution?" question for the faithful RESTafarians. I've had conversations about RESTful architectures in desktop applications that I felt were extremely useful. But without a doubt such a conversation would immediately be condemned by certain elements, probably combined with a suspicion that even asking the question is the first step in tricking / co-opting REST for your nefarious, Borg-like ends. 

It's odd that an architectural style, the sort of thing that you might expect to see fruitfully discussed at PLoP, is so prone to dogma and passion. One wonders what people are so wound up about. ]]></wp:comment_content>
