<p>Since there appears to be at least a handful of RESTifarians among my readership, I'm just going to throw this half-formed thought / almost question out there. Maybe it's a FAQ, in which case I'd appreciate a pointer in the right direction.</p><p>My observations about REST are:</p><ol><li>REST is a an "<a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems</a>". </li><li>REST "<a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm">has been used to guide the design and development</a>" of HTTP and URI.</li><li>Therefore REST as an architectural style is independent of HTTP and URI.</li><li>Yet, I get the feeling that the REST community would consider a solution that uses the REST architectural style but not HTTP and/or URI as "not RESTful".</li></ol><p>Am I wrong in observation #4 above? If you're addressing resources by resource identifiers [aka URIs] but transferring those resource representations over a durable duplex protocol [aka not HTTP], are you still RESTing?</p><p>(Note, such a RESTful durable duplex protocol doesn't exist to my knowledge, though I would be very happy to be wrong about that. SSB does durable duplex, but it doesn't support URI style resource addressing. Granted, if I was going to build a durable duplex RESTful protocol, I would build on SSB - much the same way that HTTP builds on TCP. Though I am a huge fan of SSB, I'm specifically <em>not</em> suggesting that SSB is RESTful.)</p>
