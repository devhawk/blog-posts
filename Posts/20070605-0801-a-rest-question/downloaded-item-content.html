<p>Since there appears to be at least a handful of RESTifarians among my readership, I&#8217;m just going to throw this half-formed thought / almost question out there. Maybe it&#8217;s a FAQ, in which case I&#8217;d appreciate a pointer in the right direction.</p>
<p>My observations about REST are:</p>
<ol>
<li>REST is a an &#8220;<a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems</a>&#8220;. </li>
<li>REST &#8220;<a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm">has been used to guide the design and development</a>&#8221; of HTTP and URI.</li>
<li>Therefore REST as an architectural style is independent of HTTP and URI.</li>
<li>Yet, I get the feeling that the REST community would consider a solution that uses the REST architectural style but not HTTP and/or URI as &#8220;not RESTful&#8221;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Am I wrong in observation #4 above? If you&#8217;re addressing resources by resource identifiers [aka URIs] but transferring those resource representations over a durable duplex protocol [aka not HTTP], are you still RESTing?</p>
<p>(Note, such a RESTful durable duplex protocol doesn&#8217;t exist to my knowledge, though I would be very happy to be wrong about that. SSB does durable duplex, but it doesn&#8217;t support URI style resource addressing. Granted, if I was going to build a durable duplex RESTful protocol, I would build on SSB &#8211; much the same way that HTTP builds on TCP. Though I am a huge fan of SSB, I&#8217;m specifically <em>not</em> suggesting that SSB is RESTful.)</p>
