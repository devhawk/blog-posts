Yesterday I researched <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vonage.com\/\">Vonage<\/a> and downloaded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skype.com\/\">Skype<\/a>. Given how much I use my mobile phone, I don&#8217;t think I need to spend so much on my home phone system. Vonage is much cheaper than my current phone provider &#8211; only $30 a month &#8211; which includes unlimited calling in the US. It&#8217;s got neat features like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vonage.com\/features.php?feature=virtual_phone_number\">virtual numbers<\/a>, so multiple numbers in different area codes all point to the same phone. And while it provides unlimited US calling, the phone doesn&#8217;t have to be in the US. So if my brother-in-law in Germany got it, he could call all his family in the US for free. A teammate has it, and said it works pretty well. Anyone else out there using it? If I got it, I&#8217;d like to use it with the existing phone wiring in the house. My cable box has to dial up to download program listings. I think it would be funny to use an analog model over the broadband connection.<\/p>\n<p>As for Skype, lots of people have blogged that, so I won&#8217;t bother to here, except to point out that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skype.com\/download.html\">Skype 1.0<\/a> is now available (released today). Feel free to <a href=\"callto:\/\/harrypierson\/\">skype me<\/a>, though it doesn&#8217;t appear to work through the corporate firewall.<\/p>\n<p>Update &#8211; I should have realized, but there are other choices in the internet telephone business. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lingo.com\">Lingo<\/a> caught my eye &#8211; only $20 a month for unlimited calling to the US, Canada and Western Europe (which includes Germany where my afore-mentioned brother-in-law lives). Anyone on Lingo? Also, I&#8217;m not sure why, but you can only call landlines in Europe as part of the unlimited calling plan. I also noticed that calling mobile phones in Europe on Vonage is more expensive. Why is that?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I need to start using more communication tools on the internet.
