-   What does it take to be an
    [architect](http://www.skyscrapr.net/blogs/architecture_audios_videos_webcasts/archive/2007/02/19/764.aspx)?
    [Skyscrapr.net](http://www.skyscrapr.net/) attempts to answer this
    question by asking a bunch of architects.
-   I have started teaching my children about astronomy. I found an open
    source product called [Stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/) that
    is excellent for learning about the celestial objects visible in
    your area.
-   [A Methodology for SOA
    adoption](http://regumindtrail.wordpress.com/2007/01/31/methodology-for-soa-adoption/)?
    I read an interesting blog on this subject from a couple of weeks
    ago. It’s not a long article, but the author makes some interesting
    points including an outline for SOA adoption.
-   I finally picked up [Gears of
    War](http://gearsofwar.com/emergenceday/) on Friday. It really isn’t
    a game I can see playing much, although I can see why it’s popular.
    I guess the best and the worst part of the game is having to utilize
    cover so you don’t die right away.
-   [Windows Live
    Writer](http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1)
    is a great tool! I use it to author the blogs for my
    [website](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/), and this week I have
    been using it on these Morning Doughnuts posts. My favorite feature
    is that you can preview your post and see exactly how it will appear
    on your website. This has been particularly useful since
    [Devhawk](http://www.devhawk.net/) and my site look quite different.
