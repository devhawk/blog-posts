  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If all Microsoft has got to offer is a highly bespoke VS specific tool that is based on XML to VS translation, then this is a weak effort indeed, and certainly not the vision of DSL's that people had in mind.

Metatools such as GME and EMF and standards such as MOF have emerged because DSL development is very much dependent on a technology independent meta-data foundation. Because MS has chosen to ignore this, it will end up producing tools that are ultimately constrained by what they can offer the community.]]></wp:comment_content>
