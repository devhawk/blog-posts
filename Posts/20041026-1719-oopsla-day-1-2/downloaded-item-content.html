<p>This morning was Rick Rashid&#8217;s keynote with &#8220;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/oct04/10-26oopslaecosystempr.asp">the big announcement</a>&#8220;: a framework and tools for developing Domain Specific Languages in VSTS. Essentially, this is a toolkit for building your own modeling tools on top of the infrastructure that powers the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vsent_ModelingLangs.asp">VSTS Distributed System Designers (aka WhiteHorse)</a>. Personally, I think this is pretty exciting stuff and I can&#8217;t wait to play with it more in the coming months.</p>

<p>As part of the announcement, they demoed the toolkit with a DSL for programming the flow of pages in a web application. Typically, you would use a framework like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/uipab.asp">User Interface Process</a>&nbsp;for this. However, the UIP comes with 130 pages of documentation and a variety of classes and configuration settings. By building a DSL on top of the framework, we can make the developers significantly more productive. I&#8217;ve posted a screen shot of the designer &#8211; it&#8217;s essentially a box-and-stick modeling environment &#8211; boxes are pages and sticks are transitions. Dragging a new page onto the design surface from the toolbar generates a new web page in the solution. Dragging a transition onto the design surface changes the config file. That&#8217;s much more productive than mucking around in source and config files to accomplish the same task. </p>
<p>Of course, the standard question when we announce stuff like this is &#8220;when can I get my hands on it?&#8221; We&#8217;re going to release a tech preview version of the DSL Toolkit &#8220;real soon now&#8221;. You&#8217;ll be able to download it from the newly minted <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/teamsystem/workshop/default.aspx">VSTS Workshop</a> page. I hear that this project, now that it&#8217;s public, is going to be very transparent to the community, so keep an eye out for more info (of course, I&#8217;ll blog it when the toolkit is released). Honestly, the version we&#8217;re shipping &#8220;real soon&#8221; is much rougher than what we previewed in the keynote this morning, but we&#8217;ll be updating it periodically as it marches towards release. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had several good conversations in the booth with people wanting more info about VSTS and the DSL toolkit as well as Software Factories in general. As is typical, I learn as much as I teach in these sorts of discussions. For example, I met Gan Deng from Vanderbilt who showed me GME &#8211; the <a href="http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/Projects/gme">Generic Modeling Environment</a> &#8211; which is DSL modeling environment similar conceptually to what we announced today for VSTS. Not sure when I&#8217;m going to get to play with it, but it&#8217;s nice to see academia support for DSLs.</p>
<p>The only downer is that some of the OOPSLA crowd was put-off by a product demo during the keynote. Stuart <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2004/10/27/248260.aspx">described it</a> as a &#8220;commercial break&#8221;. Several people gave me &#8220;brutal feedback&#8221; that brazen marketing displays like product demos don&#8217;t work in OOPSLA keynotes. But others thought it was cool. Good to keep in mind for next year. </p>
<p>UPDATE &#8211; Alan Kay, in his <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=421">Turing Award Lecture</a>, made a joke about about our product announcement this morning and everyone laughed, including me.</p>
<p>UPDATE 2 &#8211; After making a joke about our morning&#8217;s product demo (and several other assorted jabs),&nbsp;Alan Kay ended his Turing Award Lecture with&#8230;wait for it&#8230;a product demo. Two product demos, actually. <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a> is educational programming environment, based on Smalltalk. It is <a href="http://www.squeak.org/download/index.html">freely downloadable</a> and has an associated <a href="http://www.squeakland.org/">community</a> and <a href="http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/squeak">wiki</a>. Alan did a simple little demo where he drew a car and a steering wheel and was able to steer the car as it moved by rotating the steering wheel. Cool. Alan&#8217;s other demo, <a href="http://www.opencroquet.org/">Croquet</a> is a &#8220;massively multi-user virtual learning environment&#8221; which is built on top of Squeak. While I liked Squeak, I don&#8217;t know many people who spend significant time in a virtual 3D space who aren&#8217;t gaming. Frankly, Croquet doesn&#8217;t seem particularly practical or useful &#8211; check out this <a href="http://www.opencroquet.org/About_Croquet/screenshots/slideshow9.html">screenshot</a> of document collaboration in Croquet. In this example, the 3D space is more of a distraction than an enabler. The only place Croquet seems useful to me is for dynamic 3D simulations, such as this <a href="http://www.opencroquet.org/About_Croquet/screenshots/slideshow12.html">screenshot</a> demonstrating the Coriolis effect.</p>
