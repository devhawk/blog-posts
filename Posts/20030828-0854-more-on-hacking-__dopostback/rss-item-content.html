<p>I got an email from <a href="http://www.philweber.com/net/">Phil Weber</a> who had an <a href="http://www.philweber.com/net/stories/2002/11/20/aTaleOfTabbedPages.htm"> interesting solution</a> to the <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=47d1ff39-9789-41bf-8c76-68bf1316aa33"> __doPostBack problem</a>. He used JavaScript's <a href="http://www.insidedhtml.com/tips/functions/ts18/page1.asp">function pointer support</a> to redirect __doPostBack to a function of his own creation. In this function, he can add whatever functionality he wants, including a call to the original __doPostBack method. And what's funny, like me he was having an issue with a rich text editor. What is it about rich text editors? (They're non standard, that's probably what it is).</p><p>This is a pretty elegant solution. Especially since his solution can be enabled on a single page as needed. My solution processes every page output from the site. The primary benefit of my solution is that it can add the additional code directly into the __doPostBack function, which means I don't have to replicate the code to get the "theform" instance. Also, since it automatically fixes up every page in the web app, I don't have to remember to turn it on in every page.</p><p>If you ask Phil nicely, he might send you his code. If we all ask him nicely, maybe he'll post it.</p>
