He used JavaScript&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.insidedhtml.com\/tips\/functions\/ts18\/page1.asp\">function pointer support<\/a> to redirect __doPostBack to a function of his own creation. In this function, he can add whatever functionality he wants, including a call to the original __doPostBack method. And what&#8217;s funny, like me he was having an issue with a rich text editor. What is it about rich text editors? (They&#8217;re non standard, that&#8217;s probably what it is).<\/p>\n<p>This is a pretty elegant solution. Especially since his solution can be enabled on a single page as needed. My solution processes every page output from the site. The primary benefit of my solution is that it can add the additional code directly into the __doPostBack function, which means I don&#8217;t have to replicate the code to get the &#8220;theform&#8221; instance. Also, since it automatically fixes up every page in the web app, I don&#8217;t have to remember to turn it on in every page.<\/p>\n<p>If you ask Phil nicely, he might send you his code. If we all ask him nicely, maybe he&#8217;ll post it.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I got an email from Phil Weber who had an interesting solution to the __doPostBack problem.
