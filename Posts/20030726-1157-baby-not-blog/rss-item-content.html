No more blogging this morning - my son Patrick woke up. The fact that I got him to take a nap at all is a miracle since I'm home alone with him. My wife Julie is starting a new job in the fall so she's off learning the ropes. The job rocks in that she can bring Patrick every day, but she figured the training would go faster without him. I didn't get to see him for 9 days while I was in new Orleans, so I'm happy to have the time with him. He was pretty upset over breakfast (I guess I didn't make his oatmeal right), but otherwise he's all giggles and smiles.
