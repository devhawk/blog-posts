<p>No more blogging this morning &#8211; my son Patrick woke up. The fact that I got him to take a nap at all is a miracle since I&#8217;m home alone with him. My wife Julie is starting a new job in the fall so she&#8217;s off learning the ropes. The job rocks in that she can bring Patrick every day, but she figured the training would go faster without him. I didn&#8217;t get to see him for 9 days while I was in new Orleans, so I&#8217;m happy to have the time with him. He was pretty upset over breakfast (I guess I didn&#8217;t make his oatmeal right), but otherwise he&#8217;s all giggles and smiles.</p>
