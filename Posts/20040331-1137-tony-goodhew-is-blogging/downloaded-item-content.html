<p>Good pal Tony Goodhew just <a href="http://blogs.tonygoodhew.com/tonyg">started blogging</a> this past Sunday. He&#8217;s already posted 15 times. Even though he&#8217;s a Product Manager in the developer division and has been involved in J#, he hasn&#8217;t posted much on technology yet but he sure has <a href="http://blogs.tonygoodhew.com/tonyg/category/6.aspx">several opinions</a> on the NFL.</p>
