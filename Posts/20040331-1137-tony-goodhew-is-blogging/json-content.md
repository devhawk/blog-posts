Good pal Tony Goodhew just [started
blogging](http://blogs.tonygoodhew.com/tonyg) this past Sunday. He’s
already posted 15 times. Even though he’s a Product Manager in the
developer division and has been involved in J\#, he hasn’t posted much
on technology yet but he sure has [several
opinions](http://blogs.tonygoodhew.com/tonyg/category/6.aspx) on the
NFL.
