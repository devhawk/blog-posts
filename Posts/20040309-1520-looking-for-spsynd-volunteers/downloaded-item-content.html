<p>I had eight people waiting to be admitted to the <a href="http://devhawk.net/prj_SharePointSynd.aspx">SharePoint Syndication</a><a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=bef1fffe-6d20-42c8-a72d-ae7e9a5a194b">GDN Workspace</a>. Sorry for the delay folks &#8211; my workspace was maxed out on users and I had to get upgraded by GDN. Anyway, I&#8217;ve been given more membership slots, so the people who&#8217;ve been waiting &#8211; some since January &#8211; are now in.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of interest in this project and others like it. <a href="http://www.jonathanmalek.com/blog/">Jonathan Malek</a> has his <a href="http://www.jonathanmalek.com/blog/articles/179.aspx">SpsRssGen project</a>. <a href="http://www.asaris-matrix.com/sweber/playground/default.aspx">Sig Weber</a> has an <a href="http://www.asaris-matrix.com/sweber/playground/Lists/Announcements/DispForm.aspx?ID=23&Source=http://www.asaris-matrix.com/sweber/playground/default.aspx">RSS Generator for SPS</a>. All in all, there is quite a bit of interest in this developing for SharePoint in general and creating syndication feeds in particular. Too bad I can&#8217;t get more involved. With my new job, I just don&#8217;t have the time to work on this project anymore. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_sad.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group328" alt=":(">  </p>
<p>Since I can&#8217;t keep the project up, I&#8217;m wondering if someone else would like to take up the reins. I posted all the code to the workspace, but so far there&#8217;s been little traffic other than people wanting to join. I was hoping for more participation, but then I haven&#8217;t done anything to foster that so I really can&#8217;t complain. So let me ask explicitly: If you&#8217;re interested in being an admin on this project, please send me <a href="mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com?subject=SPSynd">email</a>. Once I get an admin (or two) and a core group of interested developers, I&#8217;ll start hosting chats /&nbsp;email lists /&nbsp;live meetings / conference calls / smoke signals / whatever to discuss the project direction. Personally, my #1 feature is an admin interface for creating the syndication feeds integrated directly into the existing SharePoint admin interface. Not sure how doable that is, but let&#8217;s find out. After that, I&#8217;m open to suggestions as to project direction.</p>
