All in all, there is quite a bit of interest in this developing for SharePoint in general and creating syndication feeds in particular. Too bad I can&#8217;t get more involved. With my new job, I just don&#8217;t have the time to work on this project anymore. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_sad.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group328\" alt=\":(\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/>  <\/p>\n<p>Since I can&#8217;t keep the project up, I&#8217;m wondering if someone else would like to take up the reins. I posted all the code to the workspace, but so far there&#8217;s been little traffic other than people wanting to join. I was hoping for more participation, but then I haven&#8217;t done anything to foster that so I really can&#8217;t complain. So let me ask explicitly: If you&#8217;re interested in being an admin on this project, please send me <a href=\"mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com?subject=SPSynd\">email<\/a>. Once I get an admin (or two) and a core group of interested developers, I&#8217;ll start hosting chats \/\u00a0email lists \/\u00a0live meetings \/ conference calls \/ smoke signals \/ whatever to discuss the project direction. Personally, my #1 feature is an admin interface for creating the syndication feeds integrated directly into the existing SharePoint admin interface. Not sure how doable that is, but let&#8217;s find out. After that, I&#8217;m open to suggestions as to project direction.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I had eight people waiting to be admitted to the SharePoint SyndicationGDN Workspace.
