In the space of a week and a half: my battery bay was damaged, my screen was damaged, and my external HD with <i>all</i> my backups on it came within a hair's breadth of going belly up. Luckily, on that last one, a few reboots and XP was able to piece everything back together again. So I backed up my backup and now am going to make a copy of the backed-up backup on CDR. Given that the XP built-in backup utility has no support for CDR, I need a decent personal backup utility. Any suggestions?
