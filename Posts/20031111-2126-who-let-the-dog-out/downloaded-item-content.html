<p>My &#8220;dog&#8221; David White started a <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/dwhite/">blog</a>. And he <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/dwhite/PermaLink.aspx/4b239d5f-44f2-4b23-a85c-23c3413d0d20"> blames me</a> for &#8220;shaming&#8221; him into doing it. That&#8217;s a first &#8211; I&#8217;ve never shamed anyone into doing anything. I&#8217;m not sure I really shamed David &#8211; &#8220;pestered&#8221; may be a better term.</p>
