After a six month silence, [Dad](http://halpierson.blogspot.com/) posted
about what he called [Business Oriented Architecture
(BOA?)](http://halpierson.blogspot.com/2005/06/business-orient-architecture-boa.html):

[John](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon) forwarded me a
[post](http://www.veryard.com/so/2005/06/business-oriented-architecture.htm)
from Richard Veryard where he comments on Dad’s post:

This comes back around to the whole SOA top-down vs. bottom-up argument.
Something I’ll comment further on when I’m not up to my armits in moving
boxes.
