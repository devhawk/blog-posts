Wow, I made it to ten of these morning coffee posts. That puts me only
two orders of magnitude behind [Mike](http://www.larkware.com/) and one
order of magnitude behind
[Sam](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/default.aspx).

-   We got snow, again. My son apparently said the other day “OK God,
    that’s enough snow now”. When a 3 year old is tired of snow, you
    know you’ve gotten a lot.
-   Of course, people in snowier climates than here (the NorthEast,
    Northen Midwest, pretty much all of Canada, etc) will snicker that 5
    inches of snow is “a lot”.
-   I’m moving my STS code into a new VPC for handoff to the dev team. I
    was running Virtual Server before, but for individual work like what
    I do, Virtual PC is much easier to use. Drag and Drop into the VPC
    alone is worth it to me to use Virtual PC instead of Virtual
    Server. I am using the [beta of Virual PC
    2007](https://connect.microsoft.com/programdetails.aspx?ProgramDetailsID=874),
    though I couldn’t tell you what the differences are.
-   [Steven King may
    love](http://www.fox.com/24/images/24_stephen_king.pdf) the new
    season of 24, but I can’t shake the feeling of [jumped
    shark](http://www.jumptheshark.com/). However, I am impressed that
    Fox released the first 4 episodes of the new season
    [today](http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/video/cl-fi-twentyfour16jan16,1,4590067.story?coll=cl-video).
-   Two name changes later, the RTM version of [SQL ~~MobileAnywhere~~
    Compact
    Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/compact/default.mspx)
    is now available. BTW, I found [this blog
    post](http://blogs.msdn.com/stevelasker/archive/2006/11/27/sql-server-compact-edition-under-asp-net-and-iis.aspx)
    by Steve Lasker about using SQLce with ASP.NET. So it sounds doable,
    though not recommend. Of course, for those of us using shared
    hosting, SQLce is a non-starter until it becomes part of the
    standard .NET framework install.
