I was running Virtual Server before, but for individual work like what I do, Virtual PC is much easier to use. Drag and Drop into the VPC alone is worth it to me to use Virtual PC instead of Virtual Server.\u00a0I am using the <a href=\"https:\/\/connect.microsoft.com\/programdetails.aspx?ProgramDetailsID=874\">beta of Virual PC 2007<\/a>, though I couldn&#8217;t tell you what the differences are. <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fox.com\/24\/images\/24_stephen_king.pdf\">Steven King may love<\/a> the new season of 24, but I can&#8217;t shake the feeling of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jumptheshark.com\/\">jumped shark<\/a>.

So it sounds doable, though not recommend. Of course, for those of us using shared hosting, SQLce is a non-starter until it becomes part of the standard .NET framework install. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Wow, I made it to ten of these morning coffee posts.
