<p>Wow, I made it to ten of these morning coffee posts. That puts me only two orders of magnitude behind <a href="http://www.larkware.com/">Mike</a>&nbsp;and one order of magnitude behind <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/default.aspx">Sam</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We got snow, again. My son apparently said the other day &#8220;OK God, that&#8217;s enough snow now&#8221;. When a 3 year old is tired of snow, you know you&#8217;ve gotten a lot.</li>
<li>Of course, people in snowier climates than here (the NorthEast, Northen Midwest, pretty much all of Canada, etc) will snicker that 5 inches of snow is &#8220;a lot&#8221;.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m moving my STS code into a new VPC for handoff to the dev team. I was running Virtual Server before, but for individual work like what I do, Virtual PC is much easier to use. Drag and Drop into the VPC alone is worth it to me to use Virtual PC instead of Virtual Server.&nbsp;I am using the <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/programdetails.aspx?ProgramDetailsID=874">beta of Virual PC 2007</a>, though I couldn&#8217;t tell you what the differences are. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.fox.com/24/images/24_stephen_king.pdf">Steven King may love</a> the new season of 24, but I can&#8217;t shake the feeling of <a href="http://www.jumptheshark.com/">jumped shark</a>. However, I am impressed that Fox released the first 4 episodes of the new season <a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/video/cl-fi-twentyfour16jan16,1,4590067.story?coll=cl-video">today</a>.</li>
<li>Two name changes later, the RTM version of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/compact/default.mspx">SQL <strike>Mobile</strike><strike>Anywhere</strike> Compact Edition</a> is now available. BTW, I found <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevelasker/archive/2006/11/27/sql-server-compact-edition-under-asp-net-and-iis.aspx">this blog post</a> by Steve Lasker about using SQLce with ASP.NET. So it sounds doable, though not recommend. Of course, for those of us using shared hosting, SQLce is a non-starter until it becomes part of the standard .NET framework install. </li>
