<p>No morning coffee posts for the first half of this week, because I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory/Wiki/View.aspx?title=CustomizationWorkshop">in training</a> thru Wednesday. Day one was mostly overview of GAT and DSL, which was review for me. Today we&#8217;re starting to dig into some of the new stuff they&#8217;ve build for the new version of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory">WSSF</a>, so I&#8217;m paying much more attention today. </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t your typical workshop in that the content is sort of being generated on the fly. As I type, we&#8217;re voting on what we&#8217;re going to cover for the next two days. Most classes I&#8217;ve been in are pre-programmed, the teacher doesn&#8217;t ask the class what topics should be covered and what order. There isn&#8217;t even one &#8220;teacher&#8221; -&nbsp;there are five folks from p&amp;p including the architect, dev lead and PM of WSSF that are tag-teaming. Even the hands-on labs aren&#8217;t completely ironed out &#8211; they&#8217;re evolving the lab directions as we do the labs. It&#8217;s atypical, but it works. </p>
