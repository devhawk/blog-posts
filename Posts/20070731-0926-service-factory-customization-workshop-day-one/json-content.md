No morning coffee posts for the first half of this week, because I’m [in
training](http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory/Wiki/View.aspx?title=CustomizationWorkshop)
thru Wednesday. Day one was mostly overview of GAT and DSL, which was
review for me. Today we’re starting to dig into some of the new stuff
they’ve build for the new version of
[WSSF](http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory), so I’m paying much more
attention today.

This isn’t your typical workshop in that the content is sort of being
generated on the fly. As I type, we’re voting on what we’re going to
cover for the next two days. Most classes I’ve been in are
pre-programmed, the teacher doesn’t ask the class what topics should be
covered and what order. There isn’t even one “teacher” - there are five
folks from p&p including the architect, dev lead and PM of WSSF that are
tag-teaming. Even the hands-on labs aren’t completely ironed out –
they’re evolving the lab directions as we do the labs. It’s atypical,
but it works.
