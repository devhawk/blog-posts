So Day One of the 2005-06 NHL season is in the books. Good for the
[Caps](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=251005023), bad for
the [Kings](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=251005009).
Really bad for the
[Penguins](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=251005011), but I
hate the Penguins so that’s cool. And I was pleasantly surprised to
discover that OLN was broadcasting the Rangers/Flyers game in HD on
INHD. They have an [HDTV broadcast
schedule](http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/1377/?tf=NHLArticleWrapper.tpl),
so the [need for
HDNet](http://devhawk.net/2005/10/04/The+NHL+In+Outlook+.aspx) just
dropped dramatically. I will have to spring for [NHL Center
Ice](http://www.indemand.com/sports/nhl2005/index.jsp) – one night of
the free preview and I’m sold. The only bummer was not getting the Caps
game live – with all 30 teams in action tonight, there weren’t enough
channels to carry them all live. But they won, and after eighteen months
and one day since their last game that is good enough for me.
