<p>So Day One of the 2005-06 NHL season is in the books. Good for the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=251005023">Caps</a>, bad for the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=251005009">Kings</a>. Really bad for the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=251005011">Penguins</a>, but I hate the Penguins so that's cool. And I was pleasantly surprised to discover that OLN was broadcasting the Rangers/Flyers game in HD on INHD. They have an <a href="http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/1377/?tf=NHLArticleWrapper.tpl">HDTV broadcast schedule</a>, so the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/10/04/The+NHL+In+Outlook+.aspx">need for HDNet</a> just dropped dramatically. I will have to spring for <a href="http://www.indemand.com/sports/nhl2005/index.jsp">NHL Center Ice</a> - one night of the free preview and I'm sold. The only bummer was not getting the Caps game live - with all 30 teams in action tonight, there weren't enough channels to carry them all live. But they won, and after eighteen months and one day since their last game that is good enough for me. </p>
