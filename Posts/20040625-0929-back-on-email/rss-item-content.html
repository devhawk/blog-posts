<p>FYI, I haven't been accessing my <a href="mailto:harry at devhawk dot net">DevHawk email address</a> for a while. Basically, I never got back in the rhythm of checking that address after the site came back up in early May. Excuses abound - I was way to busy with TechEd, work, family, I get more than enough email at my <a href="mailto:hpierson at microsoft dot com">work address</a>, blah blah blah. Anyway, I've finally got around to checking that email. Besides the ton of spam, there was also a bunch of real email from people asking questions. If you sent me email in the past two months, sorry I've ignored you. I'll stop ignoring and respond shortly! :)</p>
