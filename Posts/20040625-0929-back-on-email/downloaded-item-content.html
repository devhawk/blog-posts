<p>FYI, I haven&#8217;t been accessing my <a href="mailto:harry at devhawk dot net">DevHawk email address</a> for a while. Basically, I never got back in the rhythm of checking that address after the site came back up in early May. Excuses abound &#8211; I was way to busy with TechEd, work, family, I get more than enough email at my <a href="mailto:hpierson at microsoft dot com">work address</a>, blah blah blah. Anyway, I&#8217;ve finally got around to checking that email. Besides the ton of spam, there was also a bunch of real email from people asking questions. If you sent me email in the past two months, sorry I&#8217;ve ignored you. I&#8217;ll stop ignoring and respond shortly! <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group386" alt=":)"> </p>
