I cut my teeth developing for the windows platform with
[Windows++](http://www.dilascia.com/wpp.htm) by [Paul
Dilacia](http://www.dilascia.com/). It was about building a framework to
wrap the Win32 api. Because of the elegance of Windows++, I never ever
liked
[MFC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vcmfc98/html/mfchm.asp). I
disliked it so much that when I joined Microsoft, one of my ex-coworkers
remarked “But you hate Microsoft” to which I replied “No, I hate MFC.”

Anyway, even though most people have moved on to managed code now,
Microsoft continues to ship updates to the [Windows Template
Library](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=1be1eb52-aa96-4685-99a5-4256737781c5).
WTL is an extension to the [Active Template
Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vcmfc98/html/atl.asp)
that supports typical Windows applications (controls, dialogs, frame
windows, GDI objects, etc). The new 7.1 version support VS.NET 2003,
Windows XP and Windows CE.

I wish I had had access to WTL back in the day. I liked it so much
better than MFC.
