<p>I cut my teeth developing for the windows platform with <a href="http://www.dilascia.com/wpp.htm">Windows++</a> by <a href="http://www.dilascia.com/">Paul Dilacia</a>. It was about building a framework to wrap the Win32 api. Because of the elegance of Windows++, I never ever liked <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vcmfc98/html/mfchm.asp">MFC</a>. I disliked it so much that when I joined Microsoft, one of my ex-coworkers remarked &#8220;But you hate Microsoft&#8221; to which I replied &#8220;No, I hate MFC.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyway, even though most people have moved on to managed code now, Microsoft continues to ship updates to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=1be1eb52-aa96-4685-99a5-4256737781c5">Windows Template Library</a>. WTL is an extension to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vcmfc98/html/atl.asp">Active Template Library</a> that supports typical Windows applications (controls, dialogs, frame windows, GDI objects, etc). The new 7.1 version support VS.NET 2003, Windows XP and Windows CE.</p>
<p>I wish I had had access to WTL back in the day. I liked it so much better than MFC.</p>
