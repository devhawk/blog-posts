<p>I just posted a cool utility class called <a href="art_utility.aspx"> StringIterator</a>. It is an implementation of a C++ style <a href="http://www.cppreference.com/iterators.html">random iterator</a> for a CLR string. I needed it for the project I am working on.</p><p>I also reorg-ed my site a bit, all the utility classes are now under the <a href="articles.aspx">Articles section</a>. There's also a CRC class and a non-buffered memory stream class available from there. Enjoy.</p>
