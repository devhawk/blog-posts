  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm not sure I agree with you about Limbaugh. Certainly, Moore and Limbaugh both offer radically different versions of the "truth", but at least in Seattle Limbaugh appears on a radio station who's tagline is "News & Views you won't hear anywhere else." Also appearing on that radio statio is Bill O'Reilly who is nearly as conservative and also has a primetime show on Fox News. Sean Hannity is also on Fox News - both the TV cable network and radio network (at least in Seattle - I don't know about other markets). ]]></wp:comment_content>
