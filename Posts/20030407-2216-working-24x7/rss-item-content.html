I actually have a full-time job, a wife, two kids, and there's an unconfirmed rumour that I sometimes spend part of what little spare time I have left away from the computer. <p>While I definately plan to address bug-reports and feature-requests for SharpReader, you'll have to be patient. It took me a while to get SharpReader to a state in which I felt confident enough to release it (I started on it last year as a pet-project to teach myself C#), and it will take a while for new features to be addressed.</p><p>Sorry... </p><p>[<a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/07.html#000061">Luke Hutteman's Weblog</a>]</p></blockquote><p>No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to suggest that you should work on SharpReader 24x7. I meant that it would take at least 24 hours to sift thru the email, blog entries, bug reports and feature requests that SharpDevelop generated. Everyone I read seems to have an entry about it - I would imagine that's pretty overwhelming. </p><p>I'm wrote that I was <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=0c9d44d4-1be7-42a9-a328-f38a0fe9fc47">willing to pay</a> for SharpReader, but I still wouldn't want you or anyone to sacrifice family, job, sanity, etc. I only have one kid, but he's only 7 weeks old. And my full-time job takes me away from home for days at a time. Not that I have it better or worse than you - just that I've just taken a crash course in choosing between coding and real life so I think I know how you feel. </p><p>Awesome work on the 0.9 release. I eagerly await the next version, but I can be patient.</p>
