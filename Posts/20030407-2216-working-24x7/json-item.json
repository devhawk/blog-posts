It took me a while to get SharpReader to a state in which I felt confident enough to release it (I started on it last year as a pet-project to teach myself C#), and it will take a while for new features to be addressed.<\/p>\n<p>Sorry&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hutteman.com\/weblog\/2003\/04\/07.html#000061\">Luke Hutteman&#8217;s Weblog<\/a>]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>No, I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t mean to suggest that you should work on SharpReader 24&#215;7. I meant that it would take at least 24 hours to sift thru the email, blog entries, bug reports and feature requests that SharpDevelop generated. Everyone I read seems to have an entry about it &#8211; I would imagine that&#8217;s pretty overwhelming. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m wrote that I was <a href=\"PermaLink.aspx?guid=0c9d44d4-1be7-42a9-a328-f38a0fe9fc47\">willing to pay<\/a> for SharpReader, but I still wouldn&#8217;t want you or anyone to sacrifice family, job, sanity, etc. I only have one kid, but he&#8217;s only 7 weeks old. And my full-time job takes me away from home for days at a time. Not that I have it better or worse than you &#8211; just that I&#8217;ve just taken a crash course in choosing between coding and real life so I think I know how you feel. <\/p>\n<p>Awesome work on the 0.9 release. I eagerly await the next version, but I can be patient.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Harry Pierson writes: I see Luke has resurfaced after going dark for 24 hours straight.
