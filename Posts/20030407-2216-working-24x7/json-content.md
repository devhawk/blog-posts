No, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to suggest that you should work on
SharpReader 24×7. I meant that it would take at least 24 hours to sift
thru the email, blog entries, bug reports and feature requests that
SharpDevelop generated. Everyone I read seems to have an entry about it
– I would imagine that’s pretty overwhelming.

I’m wrote that I was [willing to
pay](PermaLink.aspx?guid=0c9d44d4-1be7-42a9-a328-f38a0fe9fc47) for
SharpReader, but I still wouldn’t want you or anyone to sacrifice
family, job, sanity, etc. I only have one kid, but he’s only 7 weeks
old. And my full-time job takes me away from home for days at a time.
Not that I have it better or worse than you – just that I’ve just taken
a crash course in choosing between coding and real life so I think I
know how you feel.

Awesome work on the 0.9 release. I eagerly await the next version, but I
can be patient.
