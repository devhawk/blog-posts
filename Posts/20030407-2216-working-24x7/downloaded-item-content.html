<p> I apologize in advance to anybody who expects me to work 24&#215;7 churning out new features and bugfixes for SharpReader because it&#8217;s just not going to happen. I actually have a full-time job, a wife, two kids, and there&#8217;s an unconfirmed rumour that I sometimes spend part of what little spare time I have left away from the computer.
</p><p>While I definately plan to address bug-reports and feature-requests for SharpReader, you&#8217;ll have to be patient. It took me a while to get SharpReader to a state in which I felt confident enough to release it (I started on it last year as a pet-project to teach myself C#), and it will take a while for new features to be addressed.</p>
<p>Sorry&#8230; </p>

<p>No, I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t mean to suggest that you should work on SharpReader 24&#215;7. I meant that it would take at least 24 hours to sift thru the email, blog entries, bug reports and feature requests that SharpDevelop generated. Everyone I read seems to have an entry about it &#8211; I would imagine that&#8217;s pretty overwhelming. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m wrote that I was <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=0c9d44d4-1be7-42a9-a328-f38a0fe9fc47">willing to pay</a> for SharpReader, but I still wouldn&#8217;t want you or anyone to sacrifice family, job, sanity, etc. I only have one kid, but he&#8217;s only 7 weeks old. And my full-time job takes me away from home for days at a time. Not that I have it better or worse than you &#8211; just that I&#8217;ve just taken a crash course in choosing between coding and real life so I think I know how you feel. </p>
<p>Awesome work on the 0.9 release. I eagerly await the next version, but I can be patient.</p>
