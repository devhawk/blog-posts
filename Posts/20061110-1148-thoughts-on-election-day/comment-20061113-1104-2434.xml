  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As much as I hate to admit it, I agree with a lot of what you wrote Harry, especially about the Republicans being fired. As far as Bush pushing through stuff before the new Congressional session I can't blame him for that. Is he really just supposed to wait until January when it will be much harder? That really wouldn't be the smartest move on his part.

As far as the Democrats cleaning house and not tolerating the corruption of the Republican I found an article I thought was really interesting.

It sure looks like the Democrats aren’t embracing the concept of draining the swamp. Not that I expected them to. Politicians are politicians no matter the party and they seem to like to defend their own.
