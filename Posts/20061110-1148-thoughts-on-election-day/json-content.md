I’ve had a few days to savor the Democrat landslide victory this past
Tuesday. I was half right about the razor thin majorities. Democrats
have a slim two seat advantage in the senate, but a fairly significant
thirty-four seat majority in the house (with ten races undecided). Given
that the Republicans had a twenty-eight seat majority in the last
congress, that’s a pretty significant turnaround for the Democrats.
Frankly, I’m pretty excited.

Here are a few short takes on the election:

-   We can close the book on Rove’s “permanent republican majority” pipe
    dream. America isn’t a conservative country. It isn’t a liberal
    country, either. It’s a moderate country. Liberal and conservative
    are the words we use to describe the direction one diverges from the
    middle ground. This election was decided by the moderates in this
    country, which isn’t surprising as the bell curve tells us that it’s
    the moderates who are in the majority. Political parties ignore the
    middle at their own peril.
-   Democrats didn’t win the election on Tuesday, the Republicans lost
    it. Hard working moderate Americans have limited tolerance for
    ineptitude and corruption, as the Democrats found out in ’94 and the
    Republicans found out this week. There are those on the left howling
    for elephant blood, but spending time exacting revenge on the
    Republicans won’t solve any of America’s hard problems. The
    Democrats are [talking like they realize
    this](http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2006/11/08/cq_1916.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1163144214-/6a4nq4LqOgJNehwFIBMbw),
    but actions speak louder than words.
-   Speaking of actions and words, President Bush [talked a good
    talk](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/11/20061108-2.html)
    Wednesday, but I’ll believe President “[The
    Decider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushism)” Bush honestly wants
    to “work with the new Congress in a bipartisan way” when I see it.
    Trying to push [John Bolton’s
    confirmation](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/09/bolton.congress/index.html)
    as well as retroactive authorization for the warrantless wiretapping
    program through congress before Democrats officially take control
    isn’t a promising start.
-   There’s no such thing as a political party that actively works for
    limited government. It isn’t that surprising, as it violates my
    [Numero
    Uno](http://devhawk.net/2006/10/03/numero-uno-theory-of-sociology/)
    theory. Individuals may want limited government, but there’s no way
    a government entity like a political party will actively work to
    reduce their own importance. Republicans claim to be for shrinking
    the federal government, but their actions contradict that claim.
    Republicans like Reagan and Bush cut taxes, but they never actually
    cut spending to match. As such, the [Federal Debt / GDP
    ratio](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7794/428/1600/a1.28.jpg)
    has about doubled in the past 18 years, with the only reduction
    coming while Clinton was in office. Claiming to cut taxes without
    cutting spending is like claiming you’re making more money because
    you’re not paying your mortgage. Republicans aren’t cutting taxes,
    they’re deferring them. It’s time to realize that you can’t [starve
    the beast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast) and move
    on to more pragmatic policies. Better a tax-and-spend liberal than a
    borrow-and-spend conservative.
