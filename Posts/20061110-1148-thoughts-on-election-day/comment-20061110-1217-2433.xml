  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Interestingly enough, I agree with pretty much everything you wrote. It will be interesting to see in 2 years if progress has been made, or more excuses. Believing Bush to cooperate when you see it may be entirely appropriate; however, I'm a little more optimistic based on his history as TX governor working with democrats. If you think about it, before the election he wasn't working with democrats at all. Heck, he wasn't even working with republicans! At the very least this election sends a loud message all politicians, and I think that is definitely a good thing.]]></wp:comment_content>
