My father, who I’ve written about and who has commented here several
times, finally started [his own blog called Hal
9000](http://halpierson.blogspot.com/) . He’s using Google’s new
service, which I guess means there is no RSS feed. I can’t find a link
to any syndication feed on the site. Of course, since it took him a week
to email me the address, maybe he’s looking to duck my criticism?
:smile:

Seriously, my Dad has been a \*HUGE\* influence on my career (though he
always thought I switched jobs too often – I say I was just looking for
the right place which I finally found @ MSFT). He’s been around UNIX and
C since the start. From Dad’s [first
post](http://halpierson.blogspot.com/2004/05/nag-nag-nag.html):

Just yesterday, I ran into a TechEd attendee who worked at Bell Labs
back in the day who recognized my last name. A friend of mine who’s an
architect evangelist for MSFT also recognized my name from his days at
Bell Labs. Sure is a small world.

Dad has also
[commented](http://halpierson.blogspot.com/2004/05/clemens-vasters-indigoed-lightweight.html)
on Clemens lightweight transactions post and [discussed
modeling](http://halpierson.blogspot.com/2004/05/models.html). I can’t
wait to see *his* reaction to Visual Studio 2005 Architect Edition’s
modeling tools.

I added a link to Hal 9000 in my navigation links section. At this rate,
will I need a family blog roll?
