My first job after getting my doctorate was at Bell Labs. In the Spring 1971 I installed my first Unix system &#8211; with Ken Thompson help.

It really depends on what you&#8217;re building. The approach taken to construct a doghouse is very different from constructing a skyscraper. Likewise, you would take different approaches to building an ERP system vs. the company picnic registration system. The bigger the problem to solve, the better off modeling the problem and solution first. <\/p>\n","parent":0},{"id":2613,"name":"Priapo","url":"http:\/\/rsc112.blogspot.com","date":"2004-06-06 16:02:15","content":"<p>Hi there -<br \/>\nIn case your father want to use another feedback different from Atom&#8217;s he can use Blogstreet Rss agregator, it&#8217;s free and works really well.
