<p>My father, who I've written about and who has commented here several times, finally started <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/">his own blog called Hal 9000</a> . He's using Google's new service, which I guess means there is no RSS feed. I can't find a link to any syndication feed on the site. Of course, since it took him a week to email me the address, maybe he's looking to duck my criticism? :)</p><p>Seriously, my Dad has been a *HUGE* influence on my career (though he always thought I switched jobs too often - I say I was just looking for the right place which I finally found @ MSFT). He's been around UNIX and C since the start. From Dad's <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/2004/05/nag-nag-nag.html">first post</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I've been around computing for a long time! My first job after getting my doctorate was at Bell Labs. In the Spring 1971 I installed my first Unix system - with Ken Thompson help. Because my thesis delt with compiler theory I was interested in C from the beginning - static routines was my suggestion.<br /><br />Over the years I've worked on air traffice controls systems, case and office tools, handwriting recognition algorithms, to name a few. I am one of the authors of the Systems Engineering CMM.<br /><br />Currently, I teach OO Programming, and OO Analysis &amp; Design at Johns Hopkins University (part-time engineering school)</p><p>My current interests include Security &amp; Enterprise Architectures for a large gov't agency; designing Service Orient Architectures; and software development tools.</p></blockquote><p>Just yesterday, I ran into a TechEd attendee who worked at Bell Labs back in the day who recognized my last name. A friend of mine who's an architect evangelist for MSFT also recognized my name from his days at Bell Labs. Sure is a small world.</p><p>Dad has also <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/2004/05/clemens-vasters-indigoed-lightweight.html">commented</a> on Clemens lightweight transactions post and <a href="http://halpierson.blogspot.com/2004/05/models.html">discussed modeling</a>. I can't wait to see <i>his</i> reaction to Visual Studio 2005 Architect Edition's modeling tools. </p><p>I added a link to Hal 9000 in my navigation links section. At this rate, will I need a family blog roll?</p>
