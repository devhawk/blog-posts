[Joel Dehlin](http://www.ldscio.org/about-joel/), a former Microsoft
employee and the CIO of the LDS church is conducting a series of tech
talks. The next one is being planned for the bay area. If you are
interested you can respond to his post
[here](http://www.ldscio.org/2007/02/21/tech-talk-in-bay-area/). The
dates would be between April 22 – 26 with a tentative agenda as follows:

-   Keynote
-   Infrastructure breakout
-   Development breakout
-   Interaction Design breakout
-   Community breakout
-   Building to building video breakout

Everything needs a [12 step
program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_step_program) now. CNN has a 12
step program to cure your email addiction

I started thinking about this after Harry’s
[post](http://devhawk.net/2007/02/16/Morning+Coffee+33.aspx) saying he
had hit zero email bounce prior to going on his secret mission.

I read an interesting blog on
[XNA](http://blogs.spouting-tech.com/thepensivegamer/2007/02/microsofts_xna_.html)
and how it fits into Microsoft’s strategy in gaming. I am not sure I
agree with all of the points, but I found the arguments to be
compelling.

My [BYU Cougars](http://www.byucougars.com/basketball_m/) are now up to
21 in the [AP
Poll](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/ncaa/men/polls/). I
can’t think of a year when both the football and basketball teams have
both had such successful seasons.

Between today and tomorrow I will be finalizing my vision document for
how I think monitoring should work in the Service-Oriented
Infrastructure project I am on. As I was outlining my vision it really
hit me how much there is to do.
