<li><a href="http://www.ldscio.org/about-joel/">Joel Dehlin</a>, a former Microsoft employee and the CIO of the LDS church is conducting a series of tech talks. The next one is being planned for the bay area. If you are interested you can respond to his post <a href="http://www.ldscio.org/2007/02/21/tech-talk-in-bay-area/">here</a>. The dates would be between April 22 &#8211; 26 with a tentative agenda as follows:</li>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Keynote</li>
<li>Infrastructure breakout  </li>
<li>Development breakout  </li>
<li>Interaction Design breakout  </li>
<li>Community breakout  </li>
<li>Building to building video breakout </li>
</ul>

<li>Everything needs a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_step_program">12 step program</a> now. CNN has a 12 step program to cure your email addiction <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/02/20/email.addiction.steps.reut/index.html">here</a>. I started thinking about this after Harry&#8217;s <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/16/Morning+Coffee+33.aspx">post</a> saying he had hit zero email bounce prior to going on his secret mission.</li>
<li>I read an interesting blog on <a href="http://blogs.spouting-tech.com/thepensivegamer/2007/02/microsofts_xna_.html">XNA</a> and how it fits into Microsoft&#8217;s strategy in gaming. I am not sure I agree with all of the points, but I found the arguments to be compelling.</li>
<li>My <a href="http://www.byucougars.com/basketball_m/">BYU Cougars</a> are now up to 21 in the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/ncaa/men/polls/">AP Poll</a>. I can&#8217;t think of a year when both the football and basketball teams have both had such successful seasons.</li>
<li>Between today and tomorrow I will be finalizing my vision document for how I think monitoring should work in the Service-Oriented Infrastructure project I am on. As I was outlining my vision it really hit me how much there is to do.</li>
