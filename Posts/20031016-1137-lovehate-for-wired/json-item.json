On the surface, post 9-11, that may sound like a good idea. But look at the examples they give: <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csis.org\">Center for Strategic and International Studies<\/a>, a Washington think tank, prepared a report last year for firefighters and other so-called &#8220;first responders&#8221; on how to react to a chemical weapons attack. But when the paper was completed, the Defense Department classified it, CSIS analyst Jim Lewis noted. Now, the firefighters will never get the benefit of that information. <\/p>\n<p>In July, a George Mason University graduate student mapped out in his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/ac2\/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A23689-2003Jul7&amp;notFound=true\"> dissertation<\/a> (registration required) the details of the country&#8217;s fiber optic network. Using information publicly available online, he spotted vulnerable spots where terrorists might strike. The paper could have been used to shore up weak links in the country&#8217;s infrastructure. Instead, the government immediately suppressed it. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I particularly liked this quote from the article: &#8220;To counter far-reaching, stealthy terrorist cabals, the country needs more openness, not less.&#8221; Sounds like Scoble&#8217;s stance on corporate transparency. <\/p>\n<p>Then there is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/news\/technology\/0,1282,60832,00.html\">Windows: More Flawed Than Ever<\/a>. While I may be a <a href=\"default.aspx#disclaimer\">biased b0rg<\/a>, I think this article offers little in the way of unbiased &#8220;news&#8221;. Yes, we <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/security\/security_bulletins\/20031015_windows.asp\"> released<\/a> four critical and one important updates for Windows yesterday. I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s &#8220;particularly embarrassing&#8221; about them. <i>ALL<\/i> security bugs are embarrassing. That&#8217;s why we work with the security community and get the stuff patched in a timely fashion, usually before anyone knows it&#8217;s a problem.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Every once in a while, I think about just yanking the Wired feed from my aggregator.
