<p>Every once in a while, I think about just yanking the Wired feed from my aggregator. I don&#8217;t usually read the articles. With Scoble posting so much, who has time to read both? <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)">  However, today I actually read two. One very interesting and one that I thought was pretty stupid.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,60836,00.html">Spies Attack White House Secrecy</a> points out that document classifications are up 400% from 10 years ago. On the surface, post 9-11, that may sound like a good idea. But look at the examples they give: </p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.csis.org">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a>, a Washington think tank, prepared a report last year for firefighters and other so-called &#8220;first responders&#8221; on how to react to a chemical weapons attack. But when the paper was completed, the Defense Department classified it, CSIS analyst Jim Lewis noted. Now, the firefighters will never get the benefit of that information. </p>
<p>In July, a George Mason University graduate student mapped out in his <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A23689-2003Jul7&notFound=true"> dissertation</a> (registration required) the details of the country&#8217;s fiber optic network. Using information publicly available online, he spotted vulnerable spots where terrorists might strike. The paper could have been used to shore up weak links in the country&#8217;s infrastructure. Instead, the government immediately suppressed it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I particularly liked this quote from the article: &#8220;To counter far-reaching, stealthy terrorist cabals, the country needs more openness, not less.&#8221; Sounds like Scoble&#8217;s stance on corporate transparency. </p>
<p>Then there is <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,60832,00.html">Windows: More Flawed Than Ever</a>. While I may be a <a href="default.aspx#disclaimer">biased b0rg</a>, I think this article offers little in the way of unbiased &#8220;news&#8221;. Yes, we <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/security_bulletins/20031015_windows.asp"> released</a> four critical and one important updates for Windows yesterday. I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s &#8220;particularly embarrassing&#8221; about them. <i>ALL</i> security bugs are embarrassing. That&#8217;s why we work with the security community and get the stuff patched in a timely fashion, usually before anyone knows it&#8217;s a problem.</p>
