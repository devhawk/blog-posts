<p>My pal <a href="http://conpro.net/">Tom</a> - who hosts DevHawk for me - recently set up a traffic analyzer so I can get a better idea about who's visiting this site. I found it interesting that just under 52% of the visits are coming from the US. Rounding out the top ten DevHawk visitor countries are UK, Canada, Zimbabwe, Australia, Germany, Sweden, China, Netherlands and France. I really dig that almost half my traffic is from outside the US. Plus, it serves as a good reminder that getting good content up on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/">Architecture Center</a> in English means we're still missing large chunk of the audience. </p>
