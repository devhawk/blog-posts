[![CNN](http://devhawk.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CNN-300x190.jpg)](http://devhawk.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CNN.jpg)Today
was a \***HUGE**\* thrill as I got to present in the keynote at
[//build](http://www.buildwindows.com/)! I’ll have more on the specifics
of Brokered WinRT Components later after my session, but apparently
quite a big deal was made of my shirt. I ended up as an [internet
meme](http://cheezburger.com/8132467456)and on the [CNN Live
Blog](http://cnntechlive.cnn.com/Event/Microsoft_Build_keynote_3/111712554)!

A long, long time ago (back when I wrote Photoshop Plugins for Mac long
before I joined Microsoft), I had a [Metrowerks
CodeWarrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWarrior)t-shirt with the
“Blood Sweat & Code” slogan on the back. I loved that slogan, but lost
the shirt somewhere along the way. So a few months ago, I decided to
make a new one – but this time with the purple and blue of Visual
Studio’s brand instead of CodeWarrior yellow. When I got a chance to be
a part of the //build keynote today, I figured it was a good wardrobe
choice.

For those who want one of their own, I posted the [design on
Zazzle](http://www.zazzle.com/blood_sweat_code_shirt-235243653937823200).
