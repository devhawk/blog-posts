I&#8217;ll have more on the specifics of Brokered WinRT Components later after my session, but apparently quite a big deal was made of my shirt. I ended up as an <a href="http://cheezburger.com/8132467456">internet meme </a>and on the <a href="http://cnntechlive.cnn.com/Event/Microsoft_Build_keynote_3/111712554">CNN Live Blog</a>!</p>
<p>A long, long&nbsp;time ago (back when I wrote Photoshop Plugins for Mac long before I joined Microsoft), I had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWarrior">Metrowerks CodeWarrior </a>t-shirt with the &#8220;Blood Sweat &amp; Code&#8221; slogan on the back. I loved that slogan, but lost the shirt somewhere along the way. So a few months ago, I decided to make a new one &#8211; but this time with the purple and blue of Visual Studio&#8217;s brand instead of&nbsp;CodeWarrior yellow. When I got a chance to be a part of the //build keynote today, I figured it was a good wardrobe choice.</p>
<p>For those who want one of their own, I posted the <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/blood_sweat_code_shirt-235243653937823200">design on Zazzle</a>.</p>
