<p>I finally have my busted laptop back. I paved it and was in the process of reinstalling the important stuff when the storm hit. Since I&#8217;ll be moving back to that machine very soon, I figured I could break quarantine on the machine I&#8217;m currently using. Since the one thing you can&#8217;t run in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/virtualpc/">Virtual PC</a> is the embedded device emulator, I decided to install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/embedded/ce.net/">Windows CE</a>. I stumbled across this article for <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/wireless/excerpt/wireless_hacks/index1.html">DIY Wireless Access Points</a> (from <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wirelesshks/index.html?CMP=IL7015">Wireless Hacks</a>) which pointed me to a couple of embedded system vendors &#8211; <a href="http://www.soekris.com/">Soekris</a> and <a href="http://www.openbrick.org/">OpenBrick</a>. I&#8217;d love to get CE up and running on one of those boxes and roll my own <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/Embedded/devices/ces/default.asp">media client device</a>, to learn about hacking embedded if for no other reason. I know Duncan has a cool <a href="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/musicxp/">homegrown audio PC project</a>, but I was thinking something embedded would be even cooler. </p>
<p>There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much, if any, grass-roots community around building CE based devices. All the efforts on the embedded website seem to be geared towards large companies. For example, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/embedded/ce.net/howtobuy/purchasing/na.asp">US distributors</a> of CE don&#8217;t list prices on their pages. I can only assume it&#8217;s a case of &#8220;if you have to ask, you can&#8217;t afford it&#8221;, at least for the individual developer. CE is not included in MSDN (though it used to be if memory serves). I can only find info on homebrew embedded hardware on <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/index.html">Linux sites</a>. </p>
<p>Where are there any other DIY or homebrew embedded sites that I don&#8217;t know about? </p>
