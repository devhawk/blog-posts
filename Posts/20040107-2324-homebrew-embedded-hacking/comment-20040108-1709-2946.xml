  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've been wanting to do the exact same thing and I've had the same troubles as you finding affordable parts and good documentation.  Maybe we should start up an online community of people who are interested and then work together to get "big company" pricing.  We could come up with a basic setup and then document the results.  Then we could order the parts in bulk if we get enough interest.  Or something like that.

I did notice that Dave Hamilton has some good entries on custom CE platforms on his weblog (http://www.daveham.net/Blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7848b818-d392-458e-afb1-98bd42fe30a1)]]></wp:comment_content>
