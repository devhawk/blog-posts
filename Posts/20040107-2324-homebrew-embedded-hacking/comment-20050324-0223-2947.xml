Not a bad idea, though it would be difficult to hit the "thousands of units" buying threshold.

I have emailed many companies for prices for PC104, PC104+ and other small SBCs, and rarely received a reply. Some of the replies have been terse and dismissive, because I've been asking about buying single units. Few replies have been genuinely helpful, and even then the prices were prohibitively high.

Only Soekris supplies the kind of SBC I want at a reasonable price.

If anyone reads this and does want to take the "community buying" idea further, I'd be willing to enter discussions. (I'm based in the UK)]]></wp:comment_content>
