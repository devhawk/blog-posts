Since I&#8217;ll be moving back to that machine very soon, I figured I could break quarantine on the machine I&#8217;m currently using. Since the one thing you can&#8217;t run in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsxp\/virtualpc\/\">Virtual PC<\/a> is the embedded device emulator, I decided to install <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/embedded\/ce.net\/\">Windows CE<\/a>. I stumbled across this article for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/pub\/a\/wireless\/excerpt\/wireless_hacks\/index1.html\">DIY Wireless Access Points<\/a> (from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oreilly.com\/catalog\/wirelesshks\/index.html?CMP=IL7015\">Wireless Hacks<\/a>) which pointed me to a couple of embedded system vendors &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.soekris.com\/\">Soekris<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openbrick.org\/\">OpenBrick<\/a>. I&#8217;d love to get CE up and running on one of those boxes and roll my own <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/Windows\/Embedded\/devices\/ces\/default.asp\">media client device<\/a>, to learn about hacking embedded if for no other reason. I know Duncan has a cool <a href=\"http:\/\/www.duncanmackenzie.net\/musicxp\/\">homegrown audio PC project<\/a>, but I was thinking something embedded would be even cooler. <\/p>\n<p>There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much, if any, grass-roots community around building CE based devices. All the efforts on the embedded website seem to be geared towards large companies. For example, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/embedded\/ce.net\/howtobuy\/purchasing\/na.asp\">US distributors<\/a> of CE don&#8217;t list prices on their pages. I can only assume it&#8217;s a case of &#8220;if you have to ask, you can&#8217;t afford it&#8221;, at least for the individual developer. CE is not included in MSDN (though it used to be if memory serves). I can only find info on homebrew embedded hardware on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linuxdevices.com\/index.html\">Linux sites<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Where are there any other DIY or homebrew embedded sites that I don&#8217;t know about? <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I finally have my busted laptop back.
