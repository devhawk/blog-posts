<p>While digging thru my referral logs, I found a link to a <a href="http://www.governments-online.org/webservices/searchItemsSOA.php">SOA news page</a> from the <a href="http://governments-online.org/">Government Online International Network</a> (or GOL-IN for short). I have no idea what this site is about, but it&#8217;s an interesting news feed on SOA. For example, I found <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1538806,00.asp">this interview</a> with Bob Sutor, IBM&#8217;s director of WebSphere infrastructure software titled &#8220;SOA <span class="Article_Title">Is So Necessary</span>&#8220;. GOL-IN gets their news via News Is Free, too bad then they don&#8217;t in turn provide their own&nbsp; RSS feed. </p>
