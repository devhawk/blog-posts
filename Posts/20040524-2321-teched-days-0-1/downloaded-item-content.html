<p>I wasn&#8217;t kidding about the calm before TechEd &#8211; I&#8217;ve been slammed for the last 36 hours &#8211; hence the lack of posts. Between 11,000+ attendees, our Road Rally and having to fill in for Pat, I&#8217;m only just now getting a chance to blog, 36 hours after TechEd started.</p>
<p>I had some free time during the day Sunday, but there wasn&#8217;t anything going on yet, so there wasn&#8217;t much to post. Then, Sunday night, we had our Architect Road Rally, which I think was a success. There were some issues &#8211; registration was a real problem in the beginning. The first three buses brought 50 people each, most of whom we had to register on site so it created a reg backlog. Even though we made some changes on site &#8211; primarily not printing event-specific badges for on-site registered attendees &#8211; I realize that registration really stunk for about 30-45 minutes after the event started. I think that, once we got past that issue, most people had a good time. Our event staff found a great venue and hired a great company to provide entertainment in the form of RC racing. <a href="http://johnporcaro.typepad.com/blog/">John</a> introduced me to the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/rallisportchallenge2">Rallisport Challenge 2</a> people, so we had Xboxes featuring RSC2. The raffles were very popular as were the event shirts &#8211; I saw around a dozen people wearing the event shirts today. So, other than the reg issues, I&#8217;d say the event worked out as well as I had hoped. TechEd 2004 is our team&#8217;s first large scale event to be formally involved in &#8211; our events typically run 250 attendees total. To compare, we drew almost 300 for the Road Rally. Marketing an event like this is really tough. The venue could support 300-400 people,&nbsp; but there are 11,000+ TechEd attendees. Even if we only invited architects, there are still somewhere around 1500 attendees who consider themselves architects @ TechEd this year. In the end, while we could have done much better on registration, I really enjoyed the party and think most attendees did too. We certainly had a large number of people on the last couple of busses back to the convention center. </p>
<p>Today started with SteveB&#8217;s keynote and the announcements of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/building/wse/">WSE2</a> availability, the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ibframework/">Information Bridge Framework</a>, and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem">VS Team System</a>. <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/rdias/">Becky</a> demoed WSE2 + IBF and Prashant demoed VS Team System. The website was live before the keynote started, a fact I pointed out to <a href="http://peterprovost.org/">Peter</a> who <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/24/1292.aspx">blogged</a> it as Steve was announcing it. Lots of people have been waiting for WSE2 RTM, but I&#8217;m really excited to see the response to Team System. I&#8217;m working with <i><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices">p&amp;p</a></i> on some community efforts that will plug into the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/architect">Architect edition of Team System</a> &#8211; watch for that in the coming months.</p>
<p>After the keynote, I delivered ARC300 and 302 &#8211; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland">Pat&#8217;s</a> sessions. They both went well, though I was pretty nervous during the ARC300 &#8211; the Metropolis Overview. Funny, since I&#8217;ve delivered that session many times before. Of course, I hadn&#8217;t ever delivered it to this large an audience (300 or so &#8211; standing room only) or on tape. ARC 302 wasn&#8217;t well attended, but those who showed got a preview of Pat&#8217;s drilldown on the parallels between the evolution of buildings and applications as well as a good half hour discussion about the metaphor. Maybe since I didn&#8217;t have high hopes for that session, I was less nervous.&nbsp;Once Pat finished those new sessions, we&#8217;ll&nbsp;tape him presenting them and get them&nbsp;up on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series">Architecture&nbsp;Strategy Series</a>&nbsp;site as soon as we can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the day finished, I ran around getting some track-owner stuff done for tomorrow and then had a HUGE margarita with my team. Now, I need sleep very badly! <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)">  </p>
