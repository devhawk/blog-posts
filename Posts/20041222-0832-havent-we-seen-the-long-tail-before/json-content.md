this [Long Tail](http://www.thelongtail.com/) stuff after I sent him a
link to the
[article](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html) and got me
thinking. Maybe this thought has been expressed else where, but isn’t
the Long Tail an updated version of the direct-to-video phenomenon? I
mean, NetFlix may have more virtual shelf space than your neighborhood
Blockbuster, but that video rental store has a similar size advantage
over the local cineplex. A 10 theater cineplex shows around 200
different movies a year, given that most movies have a 2-3 week run.
That’s a similar percentage compared to Blockbuster as Blockbuster
compared to NetFlix. I wonder what percentage of Blockbuster (or NetFlix
for that matter) rentals are never shown in theaters.

It took a while, but the major production houses eventually adapted to
this phenomenon. Disney has had huge success with DtV including sequels
of it’s biggest blockbusters. I would imagine that the media companies
will adjust to the long tail phenomenon in the long run as well.
