There’s a new Pattern and Practice out: [Application Interoperability:
Microsoft .NET and
J2EE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/jdni.asp). This
is complementary to the [.NET and J2EE Interoperability
Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/MSPress/books/6711.asp) by my teammate
[Simon Guest](http://www.simonguest.com).

FYI, I have links to many of the Patterns and Practices under
“Architecture” on my Linkroll. This new one is under “Guidance”. There
are also sections for Application Blocks, Lifecycle Management and
Patterns.
