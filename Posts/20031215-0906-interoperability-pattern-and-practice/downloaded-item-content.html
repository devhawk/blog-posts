<p>There&#8217;s a new Pattern and Practice out: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/jdni.asp">Application Interoperability: Microsoft .NET and J2EE</a>. This is complementary to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/MSPress/books/6711.asp">.NET&nbsp;and J2EE Interoperability Toolkit</a> by my teammate <a href="http://www.simonguest.com">Simon Guest</a>.</p>
<p>FYI, I have links to many of the Patterns and Practices under &#8220;Architecture&#8221; on my Linkroll. This new one is under &#8220;Guidance&#8221;. There are also sections for Application Blocks, Lifecycle Management and Patterns.</p>
