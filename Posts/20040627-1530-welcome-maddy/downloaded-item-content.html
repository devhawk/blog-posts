<p>In my almost six years of working at MSFT, I&#8217;ve had one great manager after another. I just found out one of them had a baby two months ago. Madelyn Marie Heard was born on April 30th. Congrats to her mom Jennifer, who was my manager two jobs ago when I was on MSFT&#8217;s National Technology Team. </p>
