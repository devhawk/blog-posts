Lots of oohs and aahs for
[Avalon](http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/default.aspx?pull=/msdnmag/issues/04/01/Avalon/default.aspx),
but I am much more excited about
[WinFS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/default.aspx?pull=/msdnmag/issues/04/01/WinFS/default.aspx).
Iâ€™m very interested in seeing how blogging evolves in the Longhorn wave.
