Robin has a [hilarious
post](http://blog.debreuil.com/archive/2005/03/11/652.aspx) on the
upcoming beta 2 of [Xamlon
Flash](http://www.xamlon.com/software/xamlonpro/flash/). I started
looking into flash a few weeks back for a couple of things I’m working
on. I took a quick look at what it takes to build flash movies, but
quickly realized I didn’t have the personal bandwidth to learn it.
However, Xamlon looks like it will give me the ability to work with
familiar tools. Robin sums it up this way:

> “Flash users are finally going to have access to good tools. Anyone

I asked Robin on email a few weeks ago if they saw Xamlon Flash as a way
to bring .NET developers to Flash or if they say Flash as just another
way to deploy Xaml based apps. In beta 1, it was firmly on the former as
you had to write a bunch of flash specific stuff to make anything work.
But it sounds like they’ve almost solved that:

For me, the being able to code to Flash from VS is the critical feature.
But it’s nice to know that moving to Avalon in the future may been
simple or even simply a recompile.
