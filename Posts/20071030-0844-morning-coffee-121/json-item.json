Don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s lots of other folks covering the news. <\/li>\n<li>It was a crappy sports weekend in the Pierson house. Va Tech <a href=\"http:\/\/scores.espn.go.com\/ncf\/recap?gameId=272980259\">snatched defeat from the jaws of victory<\/a>, Southern Cal <a href=\"http:\/\/scores.espn.go.com\/ncf\/recap?gameId=273002483\">never led at Oregon<\/a>, the Capitals <a href=\"http:\/\/scores.espn.go.com\/nhl\/recap?gameId=271026023\">lost<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/scores.espn.go.com\/nhl\/recap?gameId=271027019\">twice<\/a>, and the Redskins <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nfl\/recap?gameId=271028017\">got blown out by the Pats<\/a>. At least the Caps <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nhl\/recap?gameId=271029021\">won big yesterday<\/a> in Toronto. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of the Capitals, Peter Bondra <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhl.com\/nhl\/app?articleid=341538&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page\">retired Monday<\/a>. I still think it&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2004\/02\/19\/Doing+The+Unthinkable.aspx\">a travesty<\/a> that he didn&#8217;t spend his whole career in DC, but I&#8217;ve <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/07\/06\/Meeting+Ted+Leonsis.aspx\">made my peace<\/a> with it. <\/li>\n<li>Nick Malik has a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/nickmalik\/archive\/2007\/10\/12\/soa-and-the-cisr-operating-models.aspx\">great series<\/a> on business operations models and how they apply to SOA. Regular readers should be unsurprised that I favor low standardization, though I can see the value of high integration. That makes the Coordinated Operating Model my fav, though I can see the benefit of the Diversified Model as well. I can&#8217;t wait to read what Nick has to say on changing models. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Nick, I&#8217;m doing a roundtable with him on &#8220;Making SOA Work in the Enterprise&#8221; @ the Strategic Architect Forum. Should be fun. Sorry for the lack of linkage on this, but it&#8217;s an invite-only event. <\/li>\n<li>Jezz Santos has a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jezzsa\/archive\/2007\/10\/29\/packaging-building-software-factories-series.aspx\">new series of white papers<\/a> on building software factories.

I&#8217;ve been building one of these things recently, so I&#8217;m looking forward to checking that out. (via <a href=\"http:\/\/samgentile.com\/blogs\/samgentile\/archive\/2007\/10\/29\/aaron-s-wcf-adapters-in-biztalk-server-r2-paper-up.aspx\">Sam Gentile<\/a>) <\/li>\n<li>Tim Ewald looks at Resource Oriented Architecture (when did ROA become a TLA?) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pluralsight.com\/blogs\/tewald\/archive\/2007\/10\/19\/48805.aspx\">wonders<\/a> &#8220;what if your problem domain is more focused on processes than data?&#8221; I wonder that all the time.

I agree 100% with Libor that centralized management would make operation&#8217;s lives &#8220;much, MUCH easier&#8221; as he puts it. However, that doesn&#8217;t make it feasible at any significant scale. Furthermore, I wouldn&#8217;t describe an approach that requires that &#8220;all services adopt [the] same common management interface&#8221; as &#8220;pragmatic&#8221;.
