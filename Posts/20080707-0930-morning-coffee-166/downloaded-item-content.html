<p>Yes, I realize it&#8217;s been a while. I tried in vain to catch up with my blog reading after my Hawaii vacation and finally just gave up and hit &#8220;mark all as read&#8221;. </p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Languages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s a new version of the DLR hosting spec available (<a href="http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.doc">doc</a>, <a href="http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.pdf">pdf</a>). The DLR implementation is still in motion, so there are some inconsistencies between the spec and the code, but the spec should give you the high level overview you need if you want to host DLR languages inside your app.  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.tkachenko.com/blog/index.html">Oleg Tkachenko</a> recently joined the dynamic languages team. He&#8217;s the creator of the <a href="http://www.ironruby.info/ir/">Interactive IronRuby Web Shell</a>, an IronRuby version of <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">Try Ruby</a>. Of course, it&#8217;s not as cool as using SL2to execute the code directly in the browser. Michael Foord has his <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/silverlight-console/console.html">Python in the Browser</a> and my teammates John and Jimmy demoed a Silverlight version of Try Ruby @ <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/06/ironruby-at-tech-ed-2008.html">TechEd</a>.  </li>
<li>Jim Deville, also of the dynamic languages team, recently started <a href="http://blog.jredville.com/">blogging</a>.  </li>
<li>I have a new boss, Dave Remy. He doesn&#8217;t have a blog &#8211; yet &#8211; but you can follow him on Twitter as daveremy. When Twitter is actually working that is.  </li>
<li>There&#8217;s a new <a href="http://ironruby.com/">homepage/wiki for IronRuby</a> though I&#8217;m not sure why there&#8217;s a picture of Matz wearing a Python shirt on the home page.  </li>
<li>My teammate Jimmy Schementi <a href="http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/2008/07/aspnet-and-dynamic-languages.html">provides some &#8220;continued hope&#8221;</a> for a better (heck, I&#8217;ll take current) ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC story for DLR languages.  </li>
<li>Via Michael Foord, sounds like <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/documentation/index.php/Ironclad">IronClad</a> is making good progress. V0.4 can run the bz2 module &#8220;in its entirity&#8221; (maybe run a spellcheck on your site, guys?) and now <a href="http://twitter.com/voidspace/statuses/838177435">apparently</a>, it&#8217;s now able to load numpy.core. Very exciting! </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Stuff</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pat Helland, who has blogged even less than me for the past few months, has a post up about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2008/07/06/controllers-and-doers.aspx">controller and doers</a> in the IT department. After 18 months in MSIT, put me in the doer camp, please.  </li>
<li>The F# team has pushed out a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx">spec for v1.9.4 of the language</a>. Don Syme says <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/06/28/updated-specification-for-the-1-9-4-spring-refresh-release.aspx">it&#8217;s not official</a>, but it&#8217;s a huge improvement over the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/manual/lexyacc.aspx">old informal spec</a></li>
<li>Speaking of F#, my friend Matthew Podwysocki <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/06/19/announcing-fstest-a-testing-dsl-for-f.aspx">recently published</a> FsTest, a testing DSL for F#. I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/12/Practical+F+Parsing+Unit+Testing.aspx">wrote about F# unit testing</a> as part of my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/10/Practical+Parsing+In+F.aspx">PEG parsing series</a>, and I really like the direction Matthew has taken this project. You can pull it down from <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/FsTest">CodePlex</a>.  </li>
<li>When I did my <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/talks/3-03%20-%20Parsing%20Expression%20Grammars%20in%20FSharp%20-%20Harry%20Pierson.html">PEG talk</a> @ Lang.NET, <a href="http://gbracha.blogspot.com/">Gilad Bracha</a> mentioned I should check out <a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~awarth/ometa/">oMeta</a>. It looks really cool, though with the job change I haven&#8217;t had the time to play with it. Now I discover that <a href="http://www.moserware.com">Jeff Moser</a> is working on a version for CLR called <a href="http://www.moserware.com/2008/06/ometa-who-what-when-where-why.html">oMeta#</a> that I&#8217;ve got to spend some time with. And in the comments to that post, I discovered <a href="http://washort.twistedmatrix.com/2008/04/pymeta-is-more-than-just-parsing.html">pyMeta</a> from <a href="http://washort.twistedmatrix.com">Allen Short</a>, though it <a href="http://www.moserware.com/2008/06/ometa-who-what-when-where-why.html?showComment=1214526120000#c1681985703114584575">apparently doesn&#8217;t work</a> on IronPython (must investigate why).  </li>
<li>James Kovacs <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/james.kovacs/archive/2008/06/27/introducing-psake.aspx">introduces psake</a>, a PowerShell based build automation tool which uses a rake-inspired internal DSL syntax similar to one <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/21/Internal+DSLs+In+PowerShell.aspx">I blogged last year</a>. I&#8217;d love to see this take off, but given MSBuild&#8217;s tool integration, I wonder if that&#8217;s feasible. </li>
<li>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/07/09/Upgrading+My+Home+Wireless+Network.aspx">upgraded my home wireless network</a> almost exactly a year ago. I&#8217;ve been happy with the range and coverage, but not so happy with the Buffalo Tech firmware. The built-in DHCP server is pretty flaky. So I upgraded to the open-source <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato firmware</a>. Upgrade was smooth, though I did need to reset my cable modem. But even that was smooth &#8211; Comcast has an automated service for that now,</li>
