Obviously, I&#8217;ll make the code directly available, but I&#8217;m also going to be writing about it quite a bit. Since I&#8217;ll be posting lots of F# code snippets, I took the time to build an F# language syntax definition for <a href=\"http:\/\/puzzleware.net\/CodeHtmler\/default.aspx\">CodeHTMLer<\/a>. Of all the <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.live.com\/results.aspx?bt=9&amp;q=insert%20code\">various WL Writer Insert Code plug-ins<\/a>, CodeHTMLer is my favorite because it can be configured not to use &lt;pre&gt; tags, which many RSS readers handle poorly (in my experience). <\/p>\n<p>In case anyone else wants it, I&#8217;ve stuck the CodeHTMLer F# language definition up on <a href=\"http:\/\/cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com\/self.aspx\/DevHawk%20Content\/F%7C3%20CodeHTMLer%20Language%20Definition.xml\">my SkyDrive<\/a>. If you using the <a href=\"http:\/\/puzzleware.net\/download.aspx?file=\/codehtmler\/codehtmler.livewriterplugin.zip\">CodeHTMLer WL Writer Plug-in<\/a>, you can easily add this to your machine. Once you&#8217;ve installed CodeHTMLer and run it once, go to the command line and type &#8220;cd %appdata%WindowsLiveWriter&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find the LanguageDefinitions.xml file. Edit that file to insert the add the contents of <a href=\"http:\/\/cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com\/self.aspx\/DevHawk%20Content\/F%7C3%20CodeHTMLer%20Language%20Definition.xml\">my F# language definition<\/a> after the &lt;CodeLanguages&gt; tag and you&#8217;re all set. <\/p>\n<p>BTW, the first language in the file will be the default language in the plug-in, so if you&#8217;re an occasional F# user, you might want to add the F# definition to the end rather than the beginning of the file. If you don&#8217;t want to further edit the XML file manually, you can select &#8220;Edit Languages&#8221; in the plug-in and edit the order of the languages to your heart&#8217;s content.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m going to start posting about my F# parsing code soon.
