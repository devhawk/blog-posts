<p>I'm going to start posting about my F# parsing code soon. Obviously, I'll make the code directly available, but I'm also going to be writing about it quite a bit. Since I'll be posting lots of F# code snippets, I took the time to build an F# language syntax definition for <a href="http://puzzleware.net/CodeHtmler/default.aspx">CodeHTMLer</a>. Of all the <a href="http://gallery.live.com/results.aspx?bt=9&amp;q=insert%20code">various WL Writer Insert Code plug-ins</a>, CodeHTMLer is my favorite because it can be configured not to use &lt;pre&gt; tags, which many RSS readers handle poorly (in my experience). </p><p>In case anyone else wants it, I've stuck the CodeHTMLer F# language definition up on <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/F%7C3%20CodeHTMLer%20Language%20Definition.xml">my SkyDrive</a>. If you using the <a href="http://puzzleware.net/download.aspx?file=/codehtmler/codehtmler.livewriterplugin.zip">CodeHTMLer WL Writer Plug-in</a>, you can easily add this to your machine. Once you've installed CodeHTMLer and run it once, go to the command line and type "cd %appdata%WindowsLiveWriter" and you'll find the LanguageDefinitions.xml file. Edit that file to insert the add the contents of <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/F%7C3%20CodeHTMLer%20Language%20Definition.xml">my F# language definition</a> after the &lt;CodeLanguages&gt; tag and you're all set. </p><p>BTW, the first language in the file will be the default language in the plug-in, so if you're an occasional F# user, you might want to add the F# definition to the end rather than the beginning of the file. If you don't want to further edit the XML file manually, you can select "Edit Languages" in the plug-in and edit the order of the languages to your heart's content.</p>
