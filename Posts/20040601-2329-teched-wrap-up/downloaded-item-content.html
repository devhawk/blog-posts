<p>It&#8217;s been days, but I&#8217;m finally getting around to posting my <span id="rssHarry_dgFeed__ctl3_lblItem">Tech&#183;Ed </span>wrap-up. I had a great time as a speaker, track owner and attendee. My Data in SOA talk ended up with an 8.0 score and our track overall scored a 7.5. Not bad for our first time out!</p>
<p>My boss&#8217;s immediate reaction was to raise the bar for <span id="rssHarry_dgFeed__ctl3_lblItem0">Tech&#183;Ed 2005, which is fine by me as I have got some specific plans for an even better Architecture track next year. I learned a lot swimming in the deep end of the pool, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We could have been much better integrated with the other tracks, esp. the Dev track. Being involved in the planning from the start (<span id="rssHarry_dgFeed__ctl3_lblItem1">Tech&#183;Ed 05 content planning starts in earnest in the fall) should help out a bunch here, as will knowing the other track owners from this year&#8217;s event.</span></li>
<li>We could have managed our track better. But hey, it was my first time! Things like speaker meetings, more content reviews and ensuring speakers go to training all help out here. Also, I&#8217;d like a little less churn on the management side next year. I took over co-track ownership duties when one of my teammates moved onto another team.</li>
<li>I mentioned that several people commented that there should be &#8220;more code&#8221; in the track. Techie types like sessions that are heavy on the hands-on practical and code is about as hands-on practical as it gets. However, while I am <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/newsletter/default.aspx#Community">on record</a> as being an architect with a lower case &#8220;a&#8221;, I don&#8217;t think architects are just senior developers. It&#8217;s a different skill &#8211; one that I want to see broad knowledge of, but still different. Architects work primarily in models, patterns and process, not code. So for the Architecture track next year, I want to see &#8220;more models, patterns and process&#8221;, not &#8220;more code&#8221;. Watch for a focus on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/architect/default.aspx">VS2005 Team System for Architects</a>, Whitehorse and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vsts-msf.asp">MSF</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think should be in next year&#8217;s Architecture Track?</p>
