  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Interesting points re: top down and bottom up - hadn't thought of things that way and in general I agree. For this to work, though, these things need mass adoption and in an increasingly heterogenous world where systems are not all written on the technology stack of one vendor, a bottom up approach that is trying to solve a problem with a large surface area has limitations. Also, an ambitious undertaking like this seems to assume that the solution to a communication problem ( which is essentially what a modelling language solves in my opinion) , is to teach everyone to talk the same language. It doesn't happen in the real world and I am sceptical it will happen in IT.
