    [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) showed him a
    prototype web MVC framework for ASP.NET. Looking forward to seeing
    that. I thought it was interesting that Jeff described web MVC as
    “like Rails and MonoRail”. Didn’t Web MVC initially gain popularity
    on Java with toolkits like Struts and Spring? (via [Larkware

-   Martin Fowler writes about being
    [Transactionless](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Transactionless.html).
    I like to see people thinking this way, because I don’t believe
    transactions across services is feasible or loosely coupled.
    However, I still think you should use transactions inside the
    service. Also, I gotta wonder how much time all that error checking
    logic you have to write takes if you’re not using transactions.
    What’s the tradeoff?
