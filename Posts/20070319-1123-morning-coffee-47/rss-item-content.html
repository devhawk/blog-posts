Looking forward to seeing that. I thought it was interesting that Jeff described web MVC as "like Rails and MonoRail". Didn't Web MVC initially gain popularity on Java with toolkits like Struts and Spring?

I like to see people thinking this way, because I don't believe transactions across services is feasible or loosely coupled. However, I still think you should use transactions inside the service. Also, I gotta wonder how much time all that error checking logic you have to write takes if you're not using transactions. What's the tradeoff?</li></ul>
