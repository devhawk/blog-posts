Way way way back and the end of June, I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2005\/06\/24\/My+Next+Job.aspx\">left marketing to be a solution architect<\/a>. In doing so, I traded in <a href=\"http:\/\/atlasbrandview.blogspot.com\/\">Norman<\/a> for <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jdevados\/\">John<\/a> as my manager. Things were looking shiny but then Microsoft had a <a href=\"http:\/\/seattlepi.nwsource.com\/business\/241469_msftdivide21ww.html\">major reorg<\/a> back in September. These big reorgs often cause small ripples, like the director of Architecture Strategy deciding to move back to a product group. John was promoted to head the team and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/gianpaolo\">Gianpaolo<\/a> was hired to take over John&#8217;s previous role as head of solution architecture. Finally, it seemed like things were calming down on the management front, so I was caught off-guard by what happened next.<\/p>\n<p>Last Monday, John offered me a chance to switch roles.

I agreed and jumped at the chance. So now I work for Michael Platt. Don&#8217;t let the infrastructure focus of <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.technet.com\/michael_platt\">Michael&#8217;s blog<\/a> fool you &#8211; he incredibly deep on Edge Architecture and I am currently playing catch-up. The strangest thing so far is having to re-orient my thinking for consumer focused systems and away from the enterprise world where I have I&#8217;ve gotten the vast majority of my experience and where I have spent my entire Microsoft career to date.<\/p>\n<p>In the immediate future, I&#8217;m been dumped into the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mix06.com\/\">MIX06<\/a> planning process. We have other stuff going on in the MIX timeframe that I&#8217;ll get to soon enough. I&#8217;m also re-thinking my personal presence. As my career progresses, the moniker &#8220;DevHawk&#8221; seems more and more outdated. Is it?<\/p><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So for the fourth time in seven months, I have a new manager.
