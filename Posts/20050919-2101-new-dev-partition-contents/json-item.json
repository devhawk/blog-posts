Not sure what I&#8217;m going to do with all this stuff yet, but I just had to have it all. I guess the stint in marketing didn&#8217;t completely wipe out my interest in coding.<\/p>\n<p>FYI, I have to give major thumbs up to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.terabyteunlimited.com\/\">Terabyte Unlimited<\/a>&#8216;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.terabyteunlimited.com\/bootitng.html\">BootIt NG<\/a> product. My laptop runs three partitions: Production, Development and Documents. Putting all my docs on their own partition means I can pave the other two pretty much whenever I want. However, Windows XP wants to make the first partition it finds the C drive, even if you eventually choose to boot off another partition. This means I can&#8217;t create an image from on partition and restore it to the other. What a pain. But with BootIt NG, I can choose which partition to boot and hide whichever of the others I want to.<\/p>\n<p>I still use VPC for a lot of my dev work, but for Avalon and\/or device development &#8211; where VPC isn&#8217;t really practical &#8211; having a separate partition for dev work is really helpful. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m feeling particularly geeky having just re-imaged my laptop&#8217;s dev partion.
