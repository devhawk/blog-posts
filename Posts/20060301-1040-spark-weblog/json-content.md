In preperation for SPARK later this month, we (i.e. the Architecture
Strategy Team) has set up a [SPARK
Blog](http://sparklasvegas.wordpress.com/). So far it’s mostly links to
a
[few](http://www.blogjava.net/hopeshared/archive/2006/02/13/30447.html)[people](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=645ab6fc-6211-4209-adb2-7561153656c7)[talking](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=5)
about SPARK, but it’s also appears to be an opportunity to use the work
“SPARK” whenever possible, such as “[SPARKs
Fly](http://sparklasvegas.wordpress.com/2006/02/27/sparks-fly/)“.

I’m just waiting for someone to blog about SPARKitecture.
