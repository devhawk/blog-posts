<p>Now that I&#8217;ve got Pygments and its dependencies <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/08/10/Compiling+Python+Packages+Into+Assemblies.aspx">packaged up in an easy-to-distribute assembly</a>, I need to be able to call it from C#. However, if you pop open pygments.dll in Reflector, you&#8217;ll notice it&#8217;s not exactly intuitive to access. Lots of compiler generated names like pygments$12 and StringIO$64 in a type named DLRCachedCode. Clearly, this code isn&#8217;t intended to be used by anything except the IronPython runtime. </p>
<p>So we better create one of those IronPython runtime thingies.</p>
<p>As you can see in the layer diagram to the left, PygmentsCodeSource is split into two parts &#8211; a C# part and a Python part. The Python part is very simple &#8211; just importing a couple of Pygments functions into the global namespace and a simple helper function to generate syntax highlighted HTML from a given block of code in a given language and style. The code itself is pretty simple. Note the reference to the pygments assembly I described last post. Here&#8217;s the entire file:</p>
<pre class="brush: python">import clr
clr.AddReference(&quot;pygments&quot;)       

from pygments.lexers import get_all_lexers       
from pygments.styles import get_all_styles       

def generate_html(code, lexer_name, style_name):       
  from pygments import highlight       
  from pygments.lexers import get_lexer_by_name       
  from pygments.styles import get_style_by_name       
  from devhawk_formatter import DevHawkHtmlFormatter       

  if not lexer_name: lexer_name = &quot;text&quot;
  if not style_name: style_name = &quot;default&quot;
  lexer = get_lexer_by_name(lexer_name)       
  return highlight(code, lexer, DevHawkHtmlFormatter(style=style_name))
</pre>
<p>Instead of including this in the Pygments assembly, I embedded this file as a resource in my C# assembly. This way, I could use the standard DLR hosting APIs to create a script source and execute this code. I did have to build a concrete StreamContentProvider class to wrap the resource stream in, but otherwise, it&#8217;s pretty straight forward. </p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">static ScriptEngine _engine;      
static ScriptSource _source;      

private void InitializeHosting()      
{
    _engine = IronPython.Hosting.Python.CreateEngine();      

    var asm = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();      
    var stream = asm.GetManifestResourceStream(      
                   &quot;DevHawk.PygmentsCodeSource.py&quot;);      
    _source = _engine.CreateScriptSource(      
                new BasicStreamContentProvider(stream),  
                &quot;PygmentsCodeSource.py&quot;);      
}
</pre>
<p>Once I got the engine and script source set up, all that remains is setup a script scope to execute the script source in. For this specific application, it&#8217;s probably overkill to have a scope per instance &#8211; I think the syntax highlighting process is stateless so a single scope should be easily shared across multiple PygmentsCodeSource instances. But I didn&#8217;t take any chances, I created a script scope per instance to execute the source in.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">ScriptScope _scope;     
Thread _init_thread;      

public PygmentsCodeSource()      
{
    if (_engine == null)      
        InitializeHosting();      

     _scope = _engine.CreateScope();      

    _init_thread = new Thread(() =&gt; { _source.Execute(_scope); });      
    _init_thread.Start();      
}
</pre>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I&#8217;m executing the source in the scope on a background thread. That&#8217;s because it takes a while to execute, especially the first time. However, I don&#8217;t actually use the Python code until after the user types or copies a block of code into the UI and presses OK. In my experience, executing the Python code is typically finished by the time I get code into the box and press OK. I just need to make sure I add an _init_thread.Join guard anywhere I&#8217;m going to access the _scope to be sure the initialization is complete before I try to use it.</p>
<p>In the next, and last, post in this small series we&#8217;ll see how to invoke Python functions in the _scope I initialized above from C#.</p>
