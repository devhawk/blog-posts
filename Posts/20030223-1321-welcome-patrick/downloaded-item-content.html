<p>My wife Julie gave birth to our son Patrick Harold Pierson Wed. night at 10:50pm. She labored all day (14 hours) to no avail &#8211; we had to go with a c-section. But Mom and Baby are doing just great. Got home yesterday &#8211; weblogging was not on the top of the priority list. Today, I&#8217;ve read thru some of the backlog of weblogs (back-blogs?) but I&#8217;m avoiding my work inbox like the plague. Luckily, Microsoft&#8217;s awesome benefits package include a month of paternity leave so there&#8217;s no hurry getting back to work!</p>
