My wife Julie gave birth to our son Patrick Harold Pierson Wed. night at
10:50pm. She labored all day (14 hours) to no avail – we had to go with
a c-section. But Mom and Baby are doing just great. Got home yesterday –
weblogging was not on the top of the priority list. Today, I’ve read
thru some of the backlog of weblogs (back-blogs?) but I’m avoiding my
work inbox like the plague. Luckily, Microsoft’s awesome benefits
package include a month of paternity leave so there’s no hurry getting
back to work!
