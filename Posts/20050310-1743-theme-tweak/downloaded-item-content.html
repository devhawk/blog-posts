<p>For those of you visiting the site directly (as opposed to reading via syndication) I slightly tweaked the theme. All stuff related to me or the blog is down the left hand side. The right hand side has the search box, the Google ads and my blogrolls. Let me know if something isn&#8217;t working (other than the calendar &#8211; I just realized that I need to build styles for that)</p>
<p>Update &#8211; <a href="http://devhawk.net/monthView.aspx">Calendar page</a> styles are fixed.</p>
