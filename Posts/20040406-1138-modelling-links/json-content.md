[Michael](http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_platt) has posted a great list
of [modelling
links](http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_platt/articles/94569.aspx) on his
blog. I hadn’t realized [Ramesh
Rajagopal](http://blogs.msdn.com/r.ramesh) was blogging. Ramesh works on
the class designer I
[blogged](http://devhawk.net/2004/03/30/analysis-vs-design-modeling/)
about last week.

Michael also has links to MSFT’s [Dynamic Systems
Initative](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/dsiwp.mspx).
Since I came from the developer camp, I usually focus on application
architecture. DSI is going to be crititcal to infrastructure
architecture. We have a section on [infrastructure
architecture](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/systems/default.aspx)
on the [Architecture
Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture) that includes more info
on DSI.

**Update**: Michael linked to a [two
part](http://www.ftponline.com/reports/vslivesf/2004/whitehorse/)[interview](http://www.ftponline.com/reports/vslivesf/2004/whitehorse2/)
with Keith about the Whidbey modelling tools. Highly recommended.
