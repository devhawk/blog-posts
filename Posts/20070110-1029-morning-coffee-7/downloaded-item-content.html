<p>News was expecting inches, but we only got a dusting of snow last night. </p>
<ul>
<li>We had dinner last night with my old friend <a href="http://technovangelist.com">Matt</a>, who <a href="http://technovangelist.com/archive/2005/08/11/14.aspx">moved to Amsterdam</a> a year and a half ago and is getting to <a href="http://technovangelist.com/archive/2006/10/30/Visited-Countries-Getting-Redder.aspx">travel the world</a>. Kids didn&#8217;t have a nap yesterday, so they weren&#8217;t quite on their best behavior, but it was great to see Matt. Hopefully it won&#8217;t be another 18 months before we see him again. </li>
<li>For the second time in four months, the power cable for my laptop failed. I wonder if there is something wrong with the power supply that&#8217;s causing the cable to fail? At least this time I wasn&#8217;t <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/09/20/Hard+On+Hardware.aspx">in Canada</a>.  </li>
<li>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.xbox.com/NR/rdonlyres/BF491CFF-8B54-4314-9553-FD16F8F8E7B5/0/vidIPTV_InterviewHi.asx">high resolution video</a> of the Xbox 360 IPTV up on <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/ces2007">Xbox.com&#8217;s CES page</a>. They make it <em>very</em>&nbsp;clear this is &#8220;something you need to get from your service provider&#8221;. Telling quote: &#8220;It&#8217;s kinda like what I have today, but better&#8221;. Doesn&#8217;t seem that much better, so far anyway.  </li>
<li>I&#8217;m knee deep in WCF security code again. Mucking about with X.509 certificates sucks. I tried to follow these <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733813.aspx">directions</a> to create a dev root CA certificate as well as dev certs signed by said dev root CA, but I get security negotiation errors because the system can&#8217;t check to see if the cert has been revoked. I guess I&#8217;ll just install <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376539.aspx">Certificate Services</a> instead  </li>
<li>My nominee for best new acronym: <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=790">JBOWS</a> (Just a Bunch of Web Services), apparently coined by <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented">Joe McKendrick</a>. Web services, to date at least, seem like they&#8217;re being used primarily for building distributed applications, rather than a loosely coupled services.&nbsp;There&#8217;s nothing inherently wrong with that, unless you&#8217;re fooling yourself (or those holding the purse strings) that you&#8217;ll get integration &#8220;automagically&#8221; or &#8220;for free&#8221; just because you&#8217;re using web services. Joe McKendrick is definitely not an <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!271.entry">SOA-hole</a>.  </li>
<li>The next new language I learn will be <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">F#</a>. Just not sure when or how.</li>
