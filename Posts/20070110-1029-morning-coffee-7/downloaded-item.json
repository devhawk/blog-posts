I wonder if there is something wrong with the power supply that&#8217;s causing the cable to fail?

I tried to follow these <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ms733813.aspx\">directions<\/a> to create a dev root CA certificate as well as dev certs signed by said dev root CA, but I get security negotiation errors because the system can&#8217;t check to see if the cert has been revoked.
