I’ve released v0.4.1 of my [SharePoint Syndication
project](prj_sharepointsynd.aspx) (abbreviated SPSynd). Note the new
name and new link. I’ve been following [Sam Ruby’s project formerly
known as Echo](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage) with
great interest and I realized that if I wanted to support more than RSS,
I shouldn’t embed RSS in the project name. The new version supports
[WSS](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/sharepoint/default.mspx)[Beta
2 Technical
Refresh](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/techinfo/sharepoint/trial.mspx),
which is [generally
available](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B49FFDA3-05B6-4AA8-AEDD-D38A098E8A2F&displaylang=en).
I’ve also spun up a [GDN Workspace for
SPSynd](http://gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=bef1fffe-6d20-42c8-a72d-ae7e9a5a194b)
where you can download code and releases. [Collaborators
welcome](http://gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/applyjoin.aspx?id=bef1fffe-6d20-42c8-a72d-ae7e9a5a194b).
