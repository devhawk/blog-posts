<p>I came back from lunch yesterday to discover that my boss had left a new toy on my desk - a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/information/devprograms/smartphonedevkit/default.mspx">Smartphone Developer Kit</a>. Not sure where he got it, since it's all sold out. I'm stoked because I've been wanting a Smartphone for a while, but I want to use T-Mobile's service and I didn't want to pay a premium for an unlocked device. Now, I don't have to.</p><p>Any suggestions on cool Smartphone software?</p>
