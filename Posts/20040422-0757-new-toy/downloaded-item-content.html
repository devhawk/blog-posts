<p>I came back from lunch yesterday to discover that my boss had left a new toy on my desk &#8211; a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/information/devprograms/smartphonedevkit/default.mspx">Smartphone Developer Kit</a>. Not sure where he got it, since it&#8217;s all sold out. I&#8217;m stoked because I&#8217;ve been wanting a Smartphone for a while, but I want to use T-Mobile&#8217;s service and I didn&#8217;t want to pay a premium for an unlocked device. Now, I don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on cool Smartphone software?</p>
