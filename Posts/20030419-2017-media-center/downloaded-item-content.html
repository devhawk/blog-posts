<p>As was reported on <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=477">Sells Bros.</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/">Windows XP Media Center Edition</a> (MCE) is available to MSDN Universal subscribers for download. I had an older PC lying around, so I thought I&#8217;d give it a whirl. So far, pretty cool. But, of course, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you can&#8217;t write code for it. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group74" alt=":)">  Luckily, I found the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwmt/html/extensibility_guide.asp"> Media Center Extensibility Guide</a> as well as information about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwmt/html/remote_control.asp"> programming the remote control</a>. According to the remote control article, any XP Pro machine should support the remote control. So even if you don&#8217;t have MCE, you can still buy the remote control and use it (I got mine from <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproduct.asp?description=80-100-201"> NewEgg.com</a>). Only bummer &#8211; remote control messages are mapped to a variety of windows messages &#8211; WM_INPUT, WM_APPCOMMAND, WM_KEYDOWN, etc. No convenient CLR Windows Forms mapping, even though <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/productinfo/overview/default.asp#section3"> MCE</a><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats/vstudio/vstudio_121802.asp"> ships</a> with the .NET Framework.</p>
<p>Update &#8211; the remote control does, in fact, work with XP Pro. Tried it out w/ WMP to mute, change volume, move to next track, etc.</p>
