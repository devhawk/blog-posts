  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[JTD, that's not what I'm saying. Many DSL's need to relate to each other. Take Whitehorse for example: You have a app modeller and a data center modeler. These each have some unique semantics and some related semantics. If you go to deploy a web app onto a web server, some type of translation or corolation needs to take place. But within that web app, there are going to be a wide variety of semantics and abstractions - pages, controls, process flows, style sheets, postbacks, etc - that have no corolation in the data center model. Trying to make a single modeling language that supports all these semantics will be overcomplex and unusable. ]]></wp:comment_content>
