<p>I just uploaded a new version of my <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Pygments%20for%20WL%20Writer/Pygments.WLWriter.msi">Pygments for WL Writer plugin</a> to my skydrive. Nothing major here &#8211; some minor UI cleanup + an upgrade to <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=27350">IronPython 2.6 beta 2</a>. Installing over the old version worked on my machine, but that&#8217;s as far as my testing has gone. I also pushed the <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/pygments.wlwriter/tree/v1.0.2">latest source</a> out to GitHub.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still waiting on a fix for what <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dinoviehland/default.aspx">Dino</a> has taken to calling &#8220;Harry&#8217;s Pygments Import Bug&#8221; &#8211; which actually turned out to be <em>three </em>importer bugs. The Pygments lexers package is customized so as to abstract away the specific modules the individual lexers are defined in. I don&#8217;t use that functionality &#8211; I&#8217;m using <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/pygments.wlwriter/blob/5684d8e936921e9f79ab3e3f08bd1570e48a8a51/pygments_package/pygments/lexers/__init__.py#L41">get_all_lexers</a> and <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/pygments.wlwriter/blob/5684d8e936921e9f79ab3e3f08bd1570e48a8a51/pygments_package/pygments/lexers/__init__.py#L69">get_lexer_by_name</a> instead &#8211; but the bugs caused importing the package to fail so in the mean time I commented out the <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/pygments.wlwriter/blob/5684d8e936921e9f79ab3e3f08bd1570e48a8a51/pygments_package/pygments/lexers/__init__.py#L202">lines that don&#8217;t work under IronPython</a>. I think Dino&#8217;s got the fixes for this checked in, but I probably won&#8217;t update Pygments for WL Writer again until IronPython 2.6 RC.</p>
