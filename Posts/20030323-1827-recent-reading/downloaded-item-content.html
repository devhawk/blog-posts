<p>If there was any upside to being stuck in <a href="http://www.boise-airport.com/transportation/airport/">Boise Airport</a> for 2 hours, it was that I finished <a href="http://www.awprofessional.com/isapi/product_id~{1A04B59A-9B0D-45BD-B71A-031A442FD982}/catalog/product.asp"> Essential .NET Volume 1</a>. I agree with others who have weighed in with their opinion on this book &#8211; not for the beginner or casual .NET developer, but a must-have for advanced developers who want to bend CLR to their will. I liked the second half of the book better than the first, but the &#8220;Advanced Methods&#8221; chapter alone was worth the price of the book. Looking forward to Volume 2.</p>
