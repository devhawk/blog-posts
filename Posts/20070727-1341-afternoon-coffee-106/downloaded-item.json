Silverlight 1.0 RC and the Silverlight Add-in for VS08 will apparently be available in a couple of days. Finally, there&#8217;s a go-live license for the framework, so you get a head-start deploying apps before VS08 and NETFX 3.5 RTM. Time to build out a new VPC image.  <\/li>\n<li>Next week, I&#8217;m attending the p&amp;p <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/servicefactory\/Wiki\/View.aspx?title=CustomizationWorkshop\">Service Factory v3 Customization Workshop<\/a>. I&#8217;m looking forward to playing with the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/donsmith\/archive\/2007\/04\/06\/first-service-factory-v3-community-drop.aspx\">new Service Factory drop<\/a>, but I&#8217;m really interested in learning more about building factories. I wonder if they&#8217;re going to discuss their VS08 plans.  <\/li>\n<li>Nick Malik <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/nickmalik\/archive\/2007\/07\/21\/what-you-need-to-make-middle-out-soa-architecture-work.aspx\">recently wrote<\/a> about making &#8220;middle out SOA&#8221; work. I hate that term &#8220;middle-out&#8221;. It feels like we&#8217;re pinning our hopes on middle-out because we know top-down and bottom-up don&#8217;t work. My old boss <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jdevados\/\">John DeVadoss<\/a> (who assures me he&#8217;ll be blogging regularly again &#8220;soon&#8221;) big vs. little SOA, with big SOA being &#8220;dead&#8221;. I like the term &#8220;little SOA&#8221; better than &#8220;middle-out SOA&#8221;, but just because big SOA is a big failure, doesn&#8217;t mean little SOA will make any headway.  <\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s a new <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/research\/downloads\/Details\/a81e161e-1e4b-42cc-97c2-2ba9b0efba94\/Details.aspx\">F# drop available<\/a>. Don Syme <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dsyme\/archive\/2007\/07\/27\/f-1-9-2-7-released.aspx\">has the details<\/a>. Looks like they&#8217;ve got some interesting new constructs for async and parallel programing. <\/li>\n<li>ABC <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.abc.com\/fepblog\/2007\/07\/hd-streaming-ha.html\">announced yesterday<\/a> that they are streaming HD on <a href=\"http:\/\/dynamic.abc.go.com\/streaming\/landing\">their website<\/a>. So you can check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lostpedia.com\/wiki\/Through_the_Looking_Glass\">season finale<\/a> of Lost in HD for free. They embed commercials so it&#8217;s not really &#8220;for free&#8221;, but you don&#8217;t have to pay $3 an episode like you do on XBLM. I wonder if XBLM might offer this capability in the future? Certainly would increase my use of XBLM.
