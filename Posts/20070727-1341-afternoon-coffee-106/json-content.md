Lots of meetings today, so my coffee post is late…

-   The Big News^tm^: [Visual Studio
    2008](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700830.aspx) and
    .NET Framework 3.5 Beta 2 is [available for
    download](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx).
    [Soma](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/07/26/announcing-the-release-of-visual-studio-2008-beta-2-net-fx-3-5-beta-2-and-silverlight-1-0-rc.aspx)
    and
    [Scott](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/26/vs-2008-and-net-3-5-beta-2-released.aspx)
    have more. Silverlight 1.0 RC and the Silverlight Add-in for VS08
    will apparently be available in a couple of days. Finally, there’s a
    go-live license for the framework, so you get a head-start deploying
    apps before VS08 and NETFX 3.5 RTM. Time to build out a new VPC
    image.
-   Next week, I’m attending the p&p [Service Factory v3 Customization
    Workshop](http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory/Wiki/View.aspx?title=CustomizationWorkshop).
    I’m looking forward to playing with the [new Service Factory
    drop](http://blogs.msdn.com/donsmith/archive/2007/04/06/first-service-factory-v3-community-drop.aspx),
    but I’m really interested in learning more about building factories.
    I wonder if they’re going to discuss their VS08 plans.
-   Nick Malik [recently
    wrote](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/07/21/what-you-need-to-make-middle-out-soa-architecture-work.aspx)
    about making “middle out SOA” work. I hate that term “middle-out”.
    It feels like we’re pinning our hopes on middle-out because we know
    top-down and bottom-up don’t work. My old boss [John
    DeVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/) (who assures me he’ll be
    blogging regularly again “soon”) big vs. little SOA, with big SOA
    being “dead”. I like the term “little SOA” better than “middle-out
    SOA”, but just because big SOA is a big failure, doesn’t mean little
    SOA will make any headway.
-   There’s a new [F\# drop
    available](http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/a81e161e-1e4b-42cc-97c2-2ba9b0efba94/Details.aspx).
    Don Syme [has the
    details](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/07/27/f-1-9-2-7-released.aspx).
    Looks like they’ve got some interesting new constructs for async and
    parallel programing.
-   ABC [announced
    yesterday](http://blogs.abc.com/fepblog/2007/07/hd-streaming-ha.html)
    that they are streaming HD on [their
    website](http://dynamic.abc.go.com/streaming/landing). So you can
    check out the [season
    finale](http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Through_the_Looking_Glass) of
    Lost in HD for free. They embed commercials so it’s not really “for
    free”, but you don’t have to pay \$3 an episode like you do on XBLM.
    I wonder if XBLM might offer this capability in the future?
    Certainly would increase my use of XBLM. (as would an
    all-you-can-eat pricing scheme)
