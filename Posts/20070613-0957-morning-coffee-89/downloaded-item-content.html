<li>Omar Shahine has the <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/HotmailOutlookSweet.aspx">WL Hotmail + Outlook scoop</a>. Download it <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7aad7e6a-931e-438a-950c-5e9ea66322d4&displaylang=en">here</a>. I&#8217;ve used this product off and on over the past few years. Typically, I would use it, love it, but then never get around to reinstalling it after a repave since it was subscription-only product.&nbsp;  </li>
<li>Microsoft releases <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=55a4bde6-10a7-4c41-9938-f388c1ed15e9&displaylang=en&tm">eScrum project management</a> tool. I&#8217;ve seen this internally but haven&#8217;t used it yet. However, I have no doubt that the cool kids will deem it &#8220;not hot&#8221; in favor of <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence">Mingle</a>.

<li>Ted Neward <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/06/12/The+Relational+Database+Needs+No+Defense.aspx">writes at length</a> about relational databases, object databases and OR mapping. Ted may be Switzerland when it comes to platform, but he has <em>no </em>problem taking sides and mixing it up when it comes to data &amp; object persistence. He makes some interesting points that mostly boil down to &#8220;different tools for different jobs&#8221;. Also, has the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/28/The+Dual+Schema+Problem.aspx">dual schema problem</a>&nbsp;entered the general vernacular, or just Ted&#8217;s?  </li>
<li>Nick Malik <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/12/showing-up-can-be-the-hardest-part.aspx">survives his trip</a> to Nashville and has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/12/martin-fowler-wants-to-see-ruby-on-microsoft-to-save-the-alpha-geek.aspx">some thoughts</a> on Ruby, Microsoft and alpha geeks. His point about the alpha geek track record (he sites Powerbuilder, Delphi and EJB) is spot on. This is something I&#8217;ve been thinking about since <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/et2006/">ETech</a> last year. How good are alpha geeks at trendspotting? For every technology they adopt that makes the mainstream, how many don&#8217;t? I&#8217;m guessing quite a few more than the three Nick mentions.  </li>
<li>Speaking of alpha geeks, this whole <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/12/showing-up-can-be-the-hardest-part.aspx">ALT.NET</a>&nbsp;silliness reminds me of the famous Groucho Marx quote: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.&#8221; Though maybe I&#8217;m just bitter because &#8220;Working at MS&#8221; has been deemed &#8220;<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2007/06/04/alt-net-alternative-tools-and-approaches-to-mainstream-net.aspx">not hot</a>&#8220;. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group986" alt=":)"> </li>
