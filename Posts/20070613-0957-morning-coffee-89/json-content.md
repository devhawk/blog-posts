    Cool*ness*.

    scoop](http://www.shahine.com/omar/HotmailOutlookSweet.aspx).

    I’ve used this product off and on over the past few years.
    Typically, I would use it, love it, but then never get around to
    reinstalling it after a repave since it was subscription-only
    product. 
-   Microsoft releases [eScrum project
    management](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=55a4bde6-10a7-4c41-9938-f388c1ed15e9&displaylang=en&tm)
    tool. I’ve seen this internally but haven’t used it yet. However, I
    have no doubt that the cool kids will deem it “not hot” in favor of
    [Mingle](http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence).

-   Ted Neward [writes at
    length](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/06/12/The+Relational+Database+Needs+No+Defense.aspx)
    about relational databases, object databases and OR mapping. Ted may
    be Switzerland when it comes to platform, but he has *no* problem
    taking sides and mixing it up when it comes to data & object
    persistence. He makes some interesting points that mostly boil down
    to “different tools for different jobs”. Also, has the [dual schema
    problem](http://devhawk.net/2006/03/28/the-dual-schema-problem/) entered
    the general vernacular, or just Ted’s?
-   Nick Malik [survives his
    trip](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/12/showing-up-can-be-the-hardest-part.aspx)
    to Nashville and has [some
    thoughts](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/12/martin-fowler-wants-to-see-ruby-on-microsoft-to-save-the-alpha-geek.aspx)
    on Ruby, Microsoft and alpha geeks. His point about the alpha geek
    track record (he sites Powerbuilder, Delphi and EJB) is spot on.
    This is something I’ve been thinking about since
    [ETech](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/et2006/) last year. How
    good are alpha geeks at trendspotting? For every technology they
    adopt that makes the mainstream, how many don’t? I’m guessing quite
    a few more than the three Nick mentions.
-   Speaking of alpha geeks, this whole
    [ALT.NET](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/12/showing-up-can-be-the-hardest-part.aspx) silliness
    reminds me of the famous Groucho Marx quote: “I don’t want to belong
    to any club that will accept me as a member.” Though maybe I’m just
    bitter because “Working at MS” has been deemed “[not
    hot](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2007/06/04/alt-net-alternative-tools-and-approaches-to-mainstream-net.aspx)”.
