<p>I just worked thru the ASP.NET Whidbey <a href="http://www.asp.net/whidbey/downloads/HOL305.zip">Personalization HOL</a>. The docs on Whidbey&#8217;s new theme feature aren&#8217;t done, so this is the first instance I&#8217;ve seen on how to use this feature. Pretty cool stuff. The Whidbey Alpha only includes 2 themes: SmokeAndGlass and BasicBlue, but the HOL shows how to build your own (albeit an incredibly ugly one). </p>
<p>Only issue is that it seems (in the alpha at least) that the theme support is something the developer adds. But tools like <a href="http://scottwater.com/DotText">.Text</a> let you specify custom settings so the blog author can have a custom theme of their own design specified @ runtime. I wonder if later versions of Whidbey will have similar support.</p>
