I like the TPL version, though the &#8220;new Action&lt;int&gt;(RowTask)&#8221; is a little wordy. I&#8217;m guessing the eventual F# syntax will probably become something compact like &#8220;action RowTask&#8221;.

I haven&#8217;t played around with the new MVC stuff much, but I&#8217;m guessing ASP.NET&#8217;s control-based approach doesn&#8217;t work well when you separate out the controller code. If I&#8217;m manually authoring view templates, I&#8217;d much rather type NHaml&#8217;s syntax than the standard ASP.NET &lt;% &#8230;%&gt; syntax. On the other hand, there aren&#8217;t any design tools out there today handle the NHaml syntax. Also, I wonder if Andrew is working on a <a href=\"http:\/\/haml.hamptoncatlin.com\/docs\/sass\" target=\"_blank\">Sass<\/a> port.
