I guess people are checking out <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,4248,852932,00.asp">Microsoft Watch</a>. 79 referrals today! I also got a few interesting googles today : "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;hl=zh-tw&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=passion+technology">passion technology</a>", "<a href="http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=windows+informix+online+&quot;multi-query&quot;&amp;meta=">windows informix online multi-query</a>" (from Germany no less) and my favorite: "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=activeup+crack">activeup crack</a>". DevHawk is the only site that comes up when google for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=activeup+crack&amp;btnG=Google+Search">activeup crack</a>". I'm not sure - is that a good thing? :)
