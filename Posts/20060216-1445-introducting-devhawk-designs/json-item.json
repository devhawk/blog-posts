I get the occasional comment on it, so I decided to experiment and make a t-shirt out of it. These days, making your own t-shirt is cake with online services such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cafepress.com\/\">CafePress<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tshirtjunkie.com\/\">T-Shirt Junky<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zazzle.com\/\">Zazzle<\/a>. I like Zazzle&#8217;s pricing structure the best &#8211; they have a flat fee and pay you a royalty on sales. CafePress has a baseline fee and you can then charge whatever you want on top of that. I didn&#8217;t want to be mucking around with pricing, so I went with Zazzle. Also, Zazzle has more choices and options for t-shirts than CafePress did.<\/p>\n<p>My Zazzle gallery is named <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zazzle.com\/harrypierson*\">DevHawk Designs<\/a>. So far, I have two products &#8211; the Architecture Help 5\u00a2 shirt in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zazzle.com\/link.asp?associate_id=238197950402547873&amp;redirect=product&amp;product_id=235848130425737882\">black<\/a> and in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zazzle.com\/link.asp?associate_id=238197950402547873&amp;redirect=product&amp;product_id=235459386023641151\">white<\/a>, though Zazzle allows you to customize the shirt so you can get it on pink or navy blue if you really want it.\u00a0I made it with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/products\/expression\/en\/graphic_designer\">Expression Graphic Designer<\/a>, though it&#8217;s such a simple design I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t really exercise its capabilities at all.<\/p>\n<p>Other than me, I&#8217;m not sure who&#8217;s going to buy one of these. Believe me, I have no vision of being the next <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thinkgeek.com\/tshirts\/\">ThinkGeek<\/a>.
