I get the occasional comment on it, so I decided to experiment and make a t-shirt out of it. These days, making your own t-shirt is cake with online services such as <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/">CafePress</a>, <a href="http://www.tshirtjunkie.com/">T-Shirt Junky</a> and <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/">Zazzle</a>. I like Zazzle's pricing structure the best - they have a flat fee and pay you a royalty on sales. CafePress has a baseline fee and you can then charge whatever you want on top of that. I didn't want to be mucking around with pricing, so I went with Zazzle. Also, Zazzle has more choices and options for t-shirts than CafePress did.</p><p>My Zazzle gallery is named <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/harrypierson*">DevHawk Designs</a>. So far, I have two products - the Architecture Help 5¢ shirt in <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/link.asp?associate_id=238197950402547873&amp;redirect=product&amp;product_id=235848130425737882">black</a> and in <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/link.asp?associate_id=238197950402547873&amp;redirect=product&amp;product_id=235459386023641151">white</a>, though Zazzle allows you to customize the shirt so you can get it on pink or navy blue if you really want it. I made it with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/graphic_designer">Expression Graphic Designer</a>, though it's such a simple design I'm sure I didn't really exercise its capabilities at all.</p><p>Other than me, I'm not sure who's going to buy one of these. Believe me, I have no vision of being the next <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/">ThinkGeek</a>. But let me know what you think, good or bad.</p>
