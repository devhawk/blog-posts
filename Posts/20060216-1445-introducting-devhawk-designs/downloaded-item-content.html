<p>A while ago, I made a sign for my door that reads &#8220;Architecture Help 5&#162;&#8221; (in homage to <a class="grouped_elements" href="http://www.snoopy.com/comics/peanuts/fun_and_games/images/lucy_800x600.jpg" rel="tc-fancybox-group694">Lucy&#8217;s psychiatry stand</a> in <a href="http://www.snoopy.com/">Peanuts</a> of course.) I get the occasional comment on it, so I decided to experiment and make a t-shirt out of it. These days, making your own t-shirt is cake with online services such as <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/">CafePress</a>, <a href="http://www.tshirtjunkie.com/">T-Shirt Junky</a> and <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/">Zazzle</a>. I like Zazzle&#8217;s pricing structure the best &#8211; they have a flat fee and pay you a royalty on sales. CafePress has a baseline fee and you can then charge whatever you want on top of that. I didn&#8217;t want to be mucking around with pricing, so I went with Zazzle. Also, Zazzle has more choices and options for t-shirts than CafePress did.</p>
<p>My Zazzle gallery is named <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/harrypierson*">DevHawk Designs</a>. So far, I have two products &#8211; the Architecture Help 5&#162; shirt in <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/link.asp?associate_id=238197950402547873&redirect=product&product_id=235848130425737882">black</a> and in <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/link.asp?associate_id=238197950402547873&redirect=product&product_id=235459386023641151">white</a>, though Zazzle allows you to customize the shirt so you can get it on pink or navy blue if you really want it.&nbsp;I made it with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/graphic_designer">Expression Graphic Designer</a>, though it&#8217;s such a simple design I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t really exercise its capabilities at all.</p>
<p>Other than me, I&#8217;m not sure who&#8217;s going to buy one of these. Believe me, I have no vision of being the next <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/">ThinkGeek</a>. But let me know what you think, good or bad.</p>
