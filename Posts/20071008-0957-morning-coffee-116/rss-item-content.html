<p align="right">"Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue"<br />Steve McCroskey, Airplane!</p><ul><li>So it's been a while since my last post. Just over a month, not including <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/09/11/The+F5+High.aspx" target="_blank">The F5 High</a>, which wasn't "original IP". Frankly, I just stopped reading pretty much cold turkey. I wanted and needed to go heads down on day job stuff for a while. Since I haven't been reading, Morning Coffee is going to be a little cold while I ramp back up. </li><li>The new NHL season is upon us, and the <a href="http://capitals.nhl.com/" target="_blank">Caps</a> are looking good so far. Obviously, they have the new uniforms, but they're also out to a 2-0 start for the first time in five years. And in those two games, they've only allowed one goal and are 100% on the PK. It's nice to see them start strong, but obviously there's a long way to go. Here's hoping the can stay strong all season. </li><li>Speaking of staying strong, the wheels that were rattling last week came off the Trojan bandwagon completely this week. I'm not sure it's as big an upset as <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272440130" target="_blank">Appalachian State beating Michigan</a> but it's close. What happened to the team that scored 5 TD's in a row on Nebraska?  </li><li>Big news last week is that MSFT is going to release the source code to much of the .NET Framework. Scott Guthrie <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx" target="_blank">has the details</a>. Frankly, between Rotor &amp; Reflector, it wasn't like you couldn't see the source code anyway, so this seems like a no-brainer. But integrating it directly into the VS Debugging experience, that's frakking brilliant. </li><li>I haven't had a chance to install the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4de12c98-1221-4a0e-b5aa-bfc7daf02550&amp;DisplayLang=en" target="_blank">XML Schema Designer (Aug 07 CTP)</a>Â  but I was really impressed with <a href="http://datajunkies.net/screencasts/XSD%20Designer%20Demo/XSD%20Designer%20Demo%20[skits].html" target="_blank">this video</a>. The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xmlteam/archive/2007/08/27/announcing-ctp1-of-the-xml-schema-designer.aspx" target="_blank">XML Team blog</a> has more details. However, I'm not sure what the ship vehicle is. The CTP install on top of VS08 beta 2, but in the video they keep saying "a future version" of VS, implying that it's not going to be in VS08.  </li><li>Dare is <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/09/18/MessageQueuesDenormalizationAndScalability.aspx" target="_blank">spending some time</a> investigating SSB. I think it's interesting that some of the REST crowd are starting to see the need for durable messaging. Dare argues that the features and usage models are more important than wire protocol. As long as it's standardized, I don't care that much about the protocol. Several of the REST folks mentioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMQP" target="_blank">AMQP</a>. While I've got nothing against AMQP technically (frankly, I haven't read the spec), but what does it say about durable messaging vendors (including MSFT) that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase_%26_Co." target="_blank">financial institution</a> felt the need to drive an interoperable durable messaging specification?</li></ul>
