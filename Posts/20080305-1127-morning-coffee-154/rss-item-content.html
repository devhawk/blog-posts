<ul><li>Did you see <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20080304.html">yesterday's Dilbert cartoon</a>? Classic.  </li><li>MIX isn't the only Microsoft conference this week. It's also time for the annual MS Research <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/">TechFest conference</a>. It actually started yesterday, with a keynote from Rick Rashid and Craig Mundy (<a href="http://wm.microsoft.com/ms/research/events/TechFest2008/TF08Keynote.wmv">available on demand</a>). I'll be heading up there later today and will blog everything I saw that is public, <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/08/Morning+Coffee+41+TechFest+Edition.aspx">like I did last year</a>. In the meantime, you can check out some cool MS Research projects on the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/videos/default.aspx">TechFest video page</a>.  </li><li>Speaking of MS Research, they've published the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/singularity">Singularity source code</a> (for academic and non-commercial purposes) on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com">CodePlex</a>. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/">Singularity</a> is research OS "focused on the construction of dependable systems". I've wanted to play with this, but I've never had the time. Frankly, that hasn't changed, but now that it's available to the community, I'm hoping I can live vicariously thru other people hacking around with it.  </li><li>Some announcements coming out of MIX won't be a surprise to anyone:  <ul><li>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">IE Team</a> blog has been discussing IE8 quite a bit of late, and the folks of LiveSide <a href="http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2008/03/05/ie-8-beta-coming-soon-download-pages-up-now-links-not-working.aspx">are reporting</a> the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/">IE8 Readiness Toolkit</a> is already up <strike>(download links aren't live yet)</strike>. There are also a bunch of <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ie8whitepapers">developer whitepapers</a> on Code Gallery. Update: the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/Install.htm">install links</a> are live. </li><li>Scott Guthrie <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/22/first-look-at-silverlight-2.aspx">already announced</a> that Silverlight 2.0 would go beta at MIX, and Neo @ SilverlightExamples has <a href="http://www.silverlightexamples.net/post/Silverlight-20-Beta-1-Is-Available-For-Download.aspx">all the links</a> for the runtime, docs and the SDK. </li><li>Scott also <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/12/asp-net-mvc-framework-road-map-update.aspx">already announced</a> a new preview drop of ASP.NET MVC, which you can get from the <a href="http://www.asp.net/downloads/3.5-extensions/">ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions download page</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Here some primarily "new" news from MIX:. </li><ul><li>I'm not sure which team owns it, but I'd say the biggest previously-unannounced news was <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/dataservices">SQL Server Data Services</a> (aka SSDS), a "highly scalable, on-demand data storage and query processing utility services." In other words, SQL in the sky. There's a free beta sometime this month <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=110055">you can sign up for</a>. Very cool, though no word on what it's going to cost. If you're interested in this, I'd keep an I on the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/dataplatforminsider/">Data Platform Insider</a> blog.  </li><li>John Lam <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silverl.html">announces</a> the Dynamic Silverlight extension that lets you run DLR languages on Silverlight. Given that they talked about this last year, I'm not sure it's really "news", but John provides lots of gory details so it made the cute. But are they really using "DSL" as the acronym for this? Guys, that acronym's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language">already taken</a>.  </li><li>Mary Jo Foley <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1236">has a scoop</a> on Silverlight for <a href="http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1197788">Nokia Symbian mobile phones</a>.  </li><li>There's a new beta of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/download.aspx?key=studio2beta">Expression Studio 2</a> as well as a separate <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/download.aspx?key=blend2dot5">Expression Blend 2.5 preview</a> for Silverlight 2. Soma <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/03/05/a-new-era-of-expression.aspx">has the details</a>. This isn't really a surprise, but I hadn't seen any news on new versions of all the Expression Studio products. </li></ul></ul>
