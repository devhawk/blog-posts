Did you see [yesterday’s Dilbert
cartoon](http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20080304.html)?
Classic.

MIX isn’t the only Microsoft conference this week. It’s also time for
the annual MS Research [TechFest
conference](http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/). It actually
started yesterday, with a keynote from Rick Rashid and Craig Mundy
([available on
demand](http://wm.microsoft.com/ms/research/events/TechFest2008/TF08Keynote.wmv)).
I’ll be heading up there later today and will blog everything I saw that
is public, [like I did last
year](http://devhawk.net/2007/03/08/morning-coffee-41-techfest-edition/).
In the meantime, you can check out some cool MS Research projects on the
[TechFest video
page](http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/videos/default.aspx).

Speaking of MS Research, they’ve published the [Singularity source
code](http://www.codeplex.com/singularity) (for academic and
non-commercial purposes) on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com).
[Singularity](http://research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/) is research
OS “focused on the construction of dependable systems”. I’ve wanted to
play with this, but I’ve never had the time. Frankly, that hasn’t
changed, but now that it’s available to the community, I’m hoping I can
live vicariously thru other people hacking around with it.

Some announcements coming out of MIX won’t be a surprise to anyone:

-   The [IE Team](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/) blog has been discussing
    IE8 quite a bit of late, and the folks of LiveSide [are
    reporting](http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2008/03/05/ie-8-beta-coming-soon-download-pages-up-now-links-not-working.aspx)
    the [IE8 Readiness
    Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/)
    is already up ~~(download links aren’t live yet)~~. There are also a
    bunch of [developer
    whitepapers](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ie8whitepapers) on Code
    Gallery. Update: the [install
    links](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/Install.htm)
    are live.
-   Scott Guthrie [already
    announced](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/22/first-look-at-silverlight-2.aspx)
    that Silverlight 2.0 would go beta at MIX, and Neo @
    SilverlightExamples has [all the
    links](http://www.silverlightexamples.net/post/Silverlight-20-Beta-1-Is-Available-For-Download.aspx)
    for the runtime, docs and the SDK.
-   Scott also [already
    announced](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/12/asp-net-mvc-framework-road-map-update.aspx)
    a new preview drop of ASP.NET MVC, which you can get from the
    [ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions download
    page](http://www.asp.net/downloads/3.5-extensions/).

Here some primarily “new” news from MIX:.

-   I’m not sure which team owns it, but I’d say the biggest
    previously-unannounced news was [SQL Server Data
    Services](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/dataservices) (aka SSDS), a
    “highly scalable, on-demand data storage and query processing
    utility services.” In other words, SQL in the sky. There’s a free
    beta sometime this month [you can sign up
    for](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=110055). Very cool,
    though no word on what it’s going to cost. If you’re interested in
    this, I’d keep an I on the [Data Platform
    Insider](http://blogs.technet.com/dataplatforminsider/) blog.
-   John Lam
    [announces](http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silverl.html)
    the Dynamic Silverlight extension that lets you run DLR languages on
    Silverlight. Given that they talked about this last year, I’m not
    sure it’s really “news”, but John provides lots of gory details so
    it made the cute. But are they really using “DSL” as the acronym for
    this? Guys, that acronym’s [already
    taken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language).
-   Mary Jo Foley [has a
    scoop](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1236) on Silverlight for
    [Nokia Symbian mobile
    phones](http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1197788).
-   There’s a new beta of [Expression Studio
    2](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/download.aspx?key=studio2beta)
    as well as a separate [Expression Blend 2.5
    preview](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/download.aspx?key=blend2dot5)
    for Silverlight 2. Soma [has the
    details](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/03/05/a-new-era-of-expression.aspx).
    This isn’t really a surprise, but I hadn’t seen any news on new
    versions of all the Expression Studio products.
