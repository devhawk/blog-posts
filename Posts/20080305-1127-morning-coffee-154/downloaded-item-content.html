<li>Did you see <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20080304.html">yesterday&#8217;s Dilbert cartoon</a>? Classic.  </li>
<li>MIX isn&#8217;t the only Microsoft conference this week. It&#8217;s also time for the annual MS Research <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/">TechFest conference</a>. It actually started yesterday, with a keynote from Rick Rashid and Craig Mundy (<a href="http://wm.microsoft.com/ms/research/events/TechFest2008/TF08Keynote.wmv">available on demand</a>). I&#8217;ll be heading up there later today and will blog everything I saw that is public, <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/08/Morning+Coffee+41+TechFest+Edition.aspx">like I did last year</a>. In the meantime, you can check out some cool MS Research projects on the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/videos/default.aspx">TechFest video page</a>.  </li>
<li>Speaking of MS Research, they&#8217;ve published the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/singularity">Singularity source code</a> (for academic and non-commercial purposes) on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com">CodePlex</a>. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/">Singularity</a> is research OS &#8220;focused on the construction of dependable systems&#8221;. I&#8217;ve wanted to play with this, but I&#8217;ve never had the time. Frankly, that hasn&#8217;t changed, but now that it&#8217;s available to the community, I&#8217;m hoping I can live vicariously thru other people hacking around with it.  </li>
<li>Some announcements coming out of MIX won&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">IE Team</a> blog has been discussing IE8 quite a bit of late, and the folks of LiveSide <a href="http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2008/03/05/ie-8-beta-coming-soon-download-pages-up-now-links-not-working.aspx">are reporting</a> the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/">IE8 Readiness Toolkit</a> is already up <strike>(download links aren&#8217;t live yet)</strike>. There are also a bunch of <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ie8whitepapers">developer whitepapers</a> on Code Gallery. Update: the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/Install.htm">install links</a> are live. </li>
<li>Scott Guthrie <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/22/first-look-at-silverlight-2.aspx">already announced</a> that Silverlight 2.0 would go beta at MIX, and Neo @ SilverlightExamples has <a href="http://www.silverlightexamples.net/post/Silverlight-20-Beta-1-Is-Available-For-Download.aspx">all the links</a> for the runtime, docs and the SDK. </li>
<li>Scott also <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/12/asp-net-mvc-framework-road-map-update.aspx">already announced</a> a new preview drop of ASP.NET MVC, which you can get from the <a href="http://www.asp.net/downloads/3.5-extensions/">ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions download page</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here some primarily &#8220;new&#8221; news from MIX:. </li>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m not sure which team owns it, but I&#8217;d say the biggest previously-unannounced news was <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/dataservices">SQL Server Data Services</a> (aka SSDS), a &#8220;highly scalable, on-demand data storage and query processing utility services.&#8221; In other words, SQL in the sky. There&#8217;s a free beta sometime this month <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=110055">you can sign up for</a>. Very cool, though no word on what it&#8217;s going to cost. If you&#8217;re interested in this, I&#8217;d keep an I on the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/dataplatforminsider/">Data Platform Insider</a> blog.  </li>
<li>John Lam <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silverl.html">announces</a> the Dynamic Silverlight extension that lets you run DLR languages on Silverlight. Given that they talked about this last year, I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s really &#8220;news&#8221;, but John provides lots of gory details so it made the cute. But are they really using &#8220;DSL&#8221; as the acronym for this? Guys, that acronym&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language">already taken</a>.  </li>
<li>Mary Jo Foley <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1236">has a scoop</a> on Silverlight for <a href="http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1197788">Nokia Symbian mobile phones</a>.  </li>
<li>There&#8217;s a new beta of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/download.aspx?key=studio2beta">Expression Studio 2</a> as well as a separate <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/download.aspx?key=blend2dot5">Expression Blend 2.5 preview</a> for Silverlight 2. Soma <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/03/05/a-new-era-of-expression.aspx">has the details</a>. This isn&#8217;t really a surprise, but I hadn&#8217;t seen any news on new versions of all the Expression Studio products. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
