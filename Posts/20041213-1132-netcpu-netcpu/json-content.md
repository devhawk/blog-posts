[Tom](http://conpro.net/) sent me a link to Jonathan Wells’ [blog
entry](http://blogs.msdn.com/onoj/archive/2004/12/13/281951.aspx) about
the [.netcpu](http://www.dotnetcpu.com/):

> .netcpu Corporation’s new ‘.NET’ Embedded development kit includes a
> .netcpu CPU Module, a general purpose microcontroller for programming
> embedded solutions using C\# and the Microsoft .NET Embedded CLR. Use
> the kit to experiment with projects such as low-power and sensor
> applications( eg data collection and logging sensor) or create a
> simple, smart embedded device (eg smart refridgerator, robot or home
> automation system).

Note the words “Embedded CLR“…i.e. I’m 99% sure this is the same CLR
that powers the [SPOT watch](http://direct.msn.com/). [Rick
Rashid](http://devhawk.net/www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/rick) had
something in his OOPSLA keynote about this SDK. You can order the
[.netcpu Starter Kit](http://www.dotnetcpu.com/products.aspx?3) for
\$499 or just the [CPU module](http://www.dotnetcpu.com/products.aspx?7)
for \$199.

I think I need to update my xmas list…

*Update* - There’s a good [technical
article](http://www.windowsfordevices.com/news/NS4666205829.html) about
the .NET Embedded on
[WindowsForDevices](http://www.windowsfordevices.com).
