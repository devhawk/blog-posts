-   In writers strike news, the WGA has made side deals with [Worldwide
    Pants](http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/letterman-story-upcoming/)
    (aka Dave Letterman’s company), [United
    Artists](http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/wga-ua-side-deal-officially-unveiled/)
    (aka Tom Cruise’s company) and [The Weinstein
    Company](http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/heroic-harvey-hardly/)
    (~~previously known as Miramax~~). The WGA strategy of divide and
    conquer seems to me making slow progress. **Update**: The Weinstein
    Company was founded by Miramax’s founders Harvey and Bob Weinstein
    after they left Miramax. But Miramax is still around. Thanks to
    GrantC for the correction.
-   They’re still two games under .500, but the Caps completed a season
    sweep of the Eastern Conference leading Ottawa Senators last night.
    They’re only 3 games out of the top spot in the (admittedly very
    weak) Southeast division
-   Big tech news today isn’t coming from MSFT-land. [Sun is buying
    MySQL](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/winds_of_change_are_blowing)
    and [Oracle is (finally) buying
    BEA](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120048691486294361.html). Both
    deals seem like pretty significant culture clashes, though Sun/MySQL
    seems like the better fit of the two.
-   There’s a [new draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-sml-20080114/) of
    Service Modeling Language 1.1 available. If you’ll recall, this used
    to be called the [System Definition
    Model](http://www.microsoft.com/business/dsi/sdmwp.mspx), part of
    the [Dynamic Systems
    Initiative](http://www.microsoft.com/business/dsi/default.mspx).
    Hadn’t heard anything from those folks in a while, good to see
    they’re making progress.
-   Stephan Tolksdorf dropped me a line to tell me he was able to
    “vastly simplify” [FParsec](http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/), and
    as a result it now runs on the current version of F\#. Awesome!
-   Speaking of F\#, Scott Hanselman has a new [F\#
    podcast](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesPodcast96StartingSmallWithFWithDustinCampbell.aspx),
    this time interviewing [Dustin Campbell](http://diditwith.net/).
    Check out all of Dustin’s [F\#
    posts](http://diditwith.net/CategoryView,category,F%23.aspx).
-   I didn’t know about the [“Copy as Path”
    feature](http://blog.spontaneouspublicity.com/2007/12/10/productivity-tip-copy-as-path/)
    in Vista. Why is it hidden?
-   I was a big fan of the
    [WDS](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/choose/windowsdesktopsearch.mspx)
    deskbar shortcut feature – a feature that is missing in Vista. Enter
    [Start++](http://brandontools.com/content/StartPlusPlus.aspx%20) by
    [Brandon Paddock](http://brandonlive.com/), which adds shortcuts to
    Vista’s search box. It also supports “[iPhone
    apps](http://brandonlive.com/2007/08/18/iphone-apps-in-your-start-menu/)”
    and
    [scripting](http://brandonlive.com/2007/05/19/start-upcoming-feature-scripting/).
    But JScript? Where’s the PowerShell love, Brandon?
-   EA released the [source code to the original
    SimCity](http://www.donhopkins.com/home/micropolis/) under the GPL.
    Bil Simser is [digging into the
    code](http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/2008/01/14/building-a-city-the-series.aspx)
    and it looks like he’s going to port it to XNA. (via
    [Ozymandias](http://ozymandias.com/archive/2008/01/14/simcity-sourcecode-released-under-gnu-gpl.aspx))
-   Wes Haggard has [published the source
    code](http://weblogs.asp.net/whaggard/archive/2008/01/14/added-codehtmler-project-at-codeplex.aspx)
    to [CodeHTMLer on CodePlex](http://codeplex.com/CodeHtmer). He took
    two updates from me: the F\# language definition as well as the
    ability to choose the font when not using PRE tags.
