<p>I just finished upgrading my blog to the new 1.7.2 RC build. I&#8217;m excited about some of the new features, such as the major caching improvements, CAPTCHA for avoiding comment spam, and the new permalinks. The permalinks one is pretty silly, esp. because I pushed for a version that used pluses for spaces. So the permalink for this post will be New+DasBlog+Version.aspx instead of NewDasBlogVersion.aspx. But it&#8217;s a style thing (I <em>am</em> in marketing now, right?). Speaking of style, I also upgraded the site template and pared down my navigation links. I moved the blogs on that list to a new &#8220;friends and family&#8221; blogroll. I did add a link to the new <a href="http://devhawk.net/archives.aspx">Archives</a> page, which lists all the posts I&#8217;ve ever made, by category. And I added flair links to add this blog to your <a href="feed://devhawk.net/rss.ashx">desktop newsreader</a> of choice (that supports feed://) as well as to <a href="http://my.msn.com/addtomymsn.armx?id=rss&ut=http://devhawk.net/rss.ashx&ru=http://devhawk.net">My MSN</a> and <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/subscriber/subext.aspx?url=http://devhawk.net/rss.ashx">NewsGator</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still room for improvement. DasBlog still need story support, IMO. Also, I&#8217;d like to have a good offline posting experience. None of the existing blog authoring tools work for me since I use crossposts for my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk">MSDN blog</a> (which is what gets pulled into <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture">Architecture Center</a>). I end up writing my posts in FrontPage and then cutting and pasting into the dasBlog web interface. Yuck. </p>
<p>One quick note &#8211; because of the new permalink title support, a set of existing URL mappings on my site started causing internal exceptions. This is because any URL ending in aspx that isn&#8217;t a file on disk is assumed to be a permalink. Of course, all my existing mappings aren&#8217;t files on disk nor are they permalinks to blog entries. I changed these mappings from *.aspx to *.ashx to avoid these exceptions and my template and navigation links to match. The only .aspx mapping I left intact was rss.aspx, since pretty much all of my subscribers use that as my rss feed. When I upgraded from my original blog engine, I had to add the rss.aspx mapping to avoid breaking any existing subscribers. Of course, I certainly don&#8217;t want to break those subscribers now. As a quick and <em>very </em>dirty workaround, I created an empty rss.aspx file in my web app directory. Now, the title mapper doesn&#8217;t attempt to map to a permalink since there&#8217;s an existing file on disk. Oh well, that&#8217;s why this is a release candidate version.</p>
