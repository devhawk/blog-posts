I think TechEd 2005 is shaping up to be awesome again this year. They
just posted the list of
[sessions](http://www.msteched.com/content/sessions.aspx) (well, most of
the sessions anyway). I can’t link directly to the architecture
sessions, but you can filter the list to show just one track at a time
if you want to. We haven’t got speakers or abstracts posted yet, but I
can tell you that we’ve got some good speakers lined up like
[Scott](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/),
[Ted](http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog),
[Roger](http://objectwatch.com/),
[Rocky](http://www.lhotka.net/WeBlog/), and
[Steve](http://hyperthink.net/blog/).

Of the ARC track sessions, I think I’m most looking forward to “Building
and Using a Software Factory”. I jokingly call this session “Here’s the
Beef, Chris Sells”. Chris
[blogged](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1577)
that he wanted a concrete example of a software factory. It turns out
that we’ve been [working on a concrete
example](http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/10/27/248491.aspx)
since before OOPSLA. In the TechEd session, we’ll see how far
[Michael](http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/),
[Jack](http://blogs.msdn.com/jackgr) and
[Keith](http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short) have gotten since October.
