They just posted the list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.msteched.com\/content\/sessions.aspx\">sessions<\/a> (well, most of the sessions anyway). I can&#8217;t link directly to the architecture sessions, but you can filter the list to show just one track at a time if you want to. We haven&#8217;t got speakers or abstracts posted yet, but I can tell you that we&#8217;ve got some good speakers lined up like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/\">Scott<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.neward.net\/ted\/weblog\">Ted<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/objectwatch.com\/\">Roger<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lhotka.net\/WeBlog\/\">Rocky<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/hyperthink.net\/blog\/\">Steve<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Of the ARC track sessions, I think I&#8217;m most looking forward to &#8220;Building and Using a Software Factory&#8221;.
