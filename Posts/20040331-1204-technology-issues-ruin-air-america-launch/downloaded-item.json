I got to the office a bit early so I could listen online (they don&#8217;t have a Seattle station yet). Apparently, even though Al was on the cover of the <a href=\"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=F30917FB3C550C728EDDAA0894DC404482\">NYTimes magazine<\/a> a few weeks ago, they were surprised by the volume of listeners and the experience has been pretty bad.\u00a0I couldn&#8217;t even connect for the first 45 minutes. Now,\u00a0either they&#8217;ve added more servers or enought people have given up that I can at least listen.\u00a0However,\u00a0I can only listen for about a\u00a0few minutes at a time before\u00a0the connection drops and I have to manually\u00a0press play to (hopefully) reconnect. I hope Air America Radio and their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.realnetworks.com\/products\/mas\/index.html\">hosting partner<\/a> get this fixed so I can enjoy the shows until it comes to Seattle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update<\/strong>: I was able to listen to most of the last hour without constant interuption, though I&#8217;m guessing that was primarily due to people dropping off more than anything Air America or their hosting partner did. Also, Franken&#8217;s show replays from 8pm-11pm pacific time so I have it on as I type this and apparently they had a ton of technical issues to start the show &#8211; basically the first fifteen minutes has been background noise, concurrent playback of multiple audio streams and multiple news casts. I&#8217;m not even sure if what I&#8217;m listening to now is previously recorded or live &#8211; I just heard someone tell someone else to &#8220;have a good night&#8221;. Hopefully, they&#8217;ll get these issues worked out shortly.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I was excited about Al Franken&#8217;s new show &#8211; &#8220;The O&#8217;Franken Factor&#8221; &#8211; which launched\u00a0Air America Radio today.
