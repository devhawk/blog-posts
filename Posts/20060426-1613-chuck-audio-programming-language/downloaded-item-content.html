<p>I saw reference to <a href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/">ChucK</a> on <a href="http://secondlife.blogs.com/prompt/">Prompt Criticality</a>, a <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> Blog. I wanted to blog it for my own reference if for no other reason. ChucK is &#8220;a new audio programming language for real-time synthesis, composition, and performance&#8221; that &#8220;presents a new <i>time-based concurrent programming model</i>, which supports a more precise and fundamental level of expressiveness, as well as multiple, simultaneous, dynamic control rates, a <i>precise and straightforward concurrency</i>, and the ability to add, remove, and modify code, <i>on-the-fly</i>, while the program is running, without stopping or restarting&#8221;. </p>
<p>Sounds facinating, esp. given my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/04/14/Talking+Dynamic+Lanugages+With+Neal+Ford.aspx">recent discussion</a> of internal vs. external DSLs w/ Neal Ford. Plus it deals w/ concurrency and is dynamic. </p>
