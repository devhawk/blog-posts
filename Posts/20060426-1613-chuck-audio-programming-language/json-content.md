I saw reference to [ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/) on [Prompt
Criticality](http://secondlife.blogs.com/prompt/), a [Second
Life](http://www.secondlife.com/) Blog. I wanted to blog it for my own
reference if for no other reason. ChucK is “a new audio programming
language for real-time synthesis, composition, and performance” that
“presents a new *time-based concurrent programming model*, which
supports a more precise and fundamental level of expressiveness, as well
as multiple, simultaneous, dynamic control rates, a *precise and
straightforward concurrency*, and the ability to add, remove, and modify
code, *on-the-fly*, while the program is running, without stopping or
restarting”.

Sounds facinating, esp. given my [recent
discussion](http://devhawk.net/2006/04/14/Talking+Dynamic+Lanugages+With+Neal+Ford.aspx)
of internal vs. external DSLs w/ Neal Ford. Plus it deals w/ concurrency
and is dynamic.
