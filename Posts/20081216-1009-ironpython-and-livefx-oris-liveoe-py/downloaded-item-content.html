<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oriamiga/">Ori Amiga</a> is a Group Program Manager over in the Live Framework team whom you might have seen at PDC08 delivering the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/BB04/">Lap Around LiveFX &amp; Mesh Services</a> and <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/BB19/">LiveFX Programming Model Architecture and Insights</a> talks. And apparently, he&#8217;s an IronPython fan as posted a small <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oriamiga/archive/2008/11/09/livefx-using-ironpython.aspx">LiveFX Python module</a> to his blog. It&#8217;s pretty simple &#8211; it only wraps Connect and ConnectLocal &#8211; but it does cut about ten lines of path appending, reference adding and module importing code into a single import statement. Here&#8217;s the profile access script from <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/12/13/IronPython+And+LiveFX+Accessing+Profiles.aspx">my last post</a> rewritten to use Ori&#8217;s LiveOE module.</p>
<pre class="brush: python">import LiveOE     
from devhawk import linq     

uid = raw_input(&quot;Enter Windows Live ID: &quot;)
pwd = raw_input(&quot;Enter Password: &quot;)

loe = LiveOE.Connect(uid, pwd)

general = linq.Single(loe.Profiles.Entries,  
  lambda e: e.Resource.Type == LiveOE.ProfileResource.ProfileType.General)

print loe.Mesh.ProvisionedUser.Name     
print loe.Mesh.ProvisionedUser.Email     
print general.Resource.ProfileInfo.PersonalStatusMessage     
print linq.Count(loe.Contacts.Entries)
</pre>
<p>FYI, make sure you update the sdkLibsPath in LiveOE.py &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure where Ori has installed the LiveFX SDK, but it&#8217;s *not* in the location suggested by the read me file.</p>
<p>BTW, it turns out the <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/liveframework/thread/81ab8f62-3244-4ca5-b376-2d5879f47c9f/">WL Profile information is read only</a> which answers a question I had. However, reading the thread it sounds like they will eventually get around to making it read-write at some point. </p>
