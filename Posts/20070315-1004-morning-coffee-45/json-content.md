-   Yesterday’s morning coffee was canceled on account of going to main
    campus and hanging out with the Architect MVPs. I spent all
    morning + dinner with them yesterday. Some of these guys I hadn’t
    seen in nearly two years, so it was a ton of fun.
-   Nicolas Allen (aka Dr. Nick) is [looking for SQL Service Broker
    users](http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/03/15/looking-for-sql-service-broker-users.aspx).
    I cornered him at the MVP dinner last night and gave him my thoughts
    on WCF + SSB. You can head over to his blog and do the same. (I’ll
    post my answers to his questions later today, hopefully)
-   The new Vista x64 driver for my workstation’s video card does
    support monior rotation, so I’m mostly XP free at this point. I’m
    dual-booting my workstation at this point, while I
    finish configuring stuff in the Vista partition. With both my
    workstation and work ~~laptop~~ tablet, I’m XP free at work. Next, I
    start getting home machines moved over.
-   Tom Hollander reports on a new drop of the [Guidance Automation
    Toolkit](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2007/03/13/just-released-gat-and-gax-february-2007-ctp.aspx).
    Mostly bug fixes like Vista support, but the [full list is
    here](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/pages/guidance-automation-extensions-and-guidance-automation-toolkit-february-2007-community-technology-preview.aspx).
    It’s an ugly upgrade process. You have to uninstall all existing
    guidance packages. I can’t wait until this technology is
    “integrate[d] … more deeply into Visual Studio and Team System”.

-   I’ve been thinking of getting a Wii, and the fact I can [hack code
    for
    it](http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/03/15/looking-for-sql-service-broker-users.aspx)
    – managed code for managed snobs no less – is just another good
    reason to do it. (via
