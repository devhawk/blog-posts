<ul><li>Yesterday's morning coffee was canceled on account of going to main campus and hanging out with the Architect MVPs. I spent all morning + dinner with them yesterday. Some of these guys I hadn't seen in nearly two years, so it was a ton of fun.</li><li>Nicolas Allen (aka Dr. Nick) is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/03/15/looking-for-sql-service-broker-users.aspx">looking for SQL Service Broker users</a>. I cornered him at the MVP dinner last night and gave him my thoughts on WCF + SSB. You can head over to his blog and do the same. (I'll post my answers to his questions later today, hopefully)</li><li>The new Vista x64 driver for my workstation's video card does support monior rotation, so I'm mostly XP free at this point. I'm dual-booting my workstation at this point, while I finishÂ configuring stuff in the Vista partition. With both my workstation and work <strike>laptop</strike> tablet, I'm XP free at work. Next, I start getting home machines moved over.  </li><li>Tom Hollander reports on a new drop of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2007/03/13/just-released-gat-and-gax-february-2007-ctp.aspx">Guidance Automation Toolkit</a>. Mostly bug fixes like Vista support, but the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/pages/guidance-automation-extensions-and-guidance-automation-toolkit-february-2007-community-technology-preview.aspx">full list is here</a>. It's an ugly upgrade process. You have to uninstall all existing guidance packages. I can't wait until this technology is "integrate[d] ... more deeply into Visual Studio and Team System".  </li><li>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/08/Morning+Coffee+41+TechFest+Edition.aspx">mentioned</a> the Podcast Authoring tool that I saw at TechFest last week. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/microsofts-techfest-2007-randd-blowout/176053/">Here</a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/gallery/microsofts-techfest-2007-randd-blowout/176030/">are</a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/gallery/microsofts-techfest-2007-randd-blowout/176074/">some</a> pictures of it from engadget (via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lokeuei">Loke Uei Tan</a>) </li><li>I've been thinking of getting a Wii, and the fact I can <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/03/15/looking-for-sql-service-broker-users.aspx">hack code for it</a> - managed code for managed snobs no less - is just another good reason to do it.
