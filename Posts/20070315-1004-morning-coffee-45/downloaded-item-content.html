<li>Yesterday&#8217;s morning coffee was canceled on account of going to main campus and hanging out with the Architect MVPs. I spent all morning + dinner with them yesterday. Some of these guys I hadn&#8217;t seen in nearly two years, so it was a ton of fun.</li>
<li>Nicolas Allen (aka Dr. Nick) is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/03/15/looking-for-sql-service-broker-users.aspx">looking for SQL Service Broker users</a>. I cornered him at the MVP dinner last night and gave him my thoughts on WCF + SSB. You can head over to his blog and do the same. (I&#8217;ll post my answers to his questions later today, hopefully)</li>
<li>The new Vista x64 driver for my workstation&#8217;s video card does support monior rotation, so I&#8217;m mostly XP free at this point. I&#8217;m dual-booting my workstation at this point, while I finish&nbsp;configuring stuff in the Vista partition. With both my workstation and work <strike>laptop</strike> tablet, I&#8217;m XP free at work. Next, I start getting home machines moved over.  </li>
<li>Tom Hollander reports on a new drop of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2007/03/13/just-released-gat-and-gax-february-2007-ctp.aspx">Guidance Automation Toolkit</a>. Mostly bug fixes like Vista support, but the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/pages/guidance-automation-extensions-and-guidance-automation-toolkit-february-2007-community-technology-preview.aspx">full list is here</a>. It&#8217;s an ugly upgrade process. You have to uninstall all existing guidance packages. I can&#8217;t wait until this technology is &#8220;integrate[d] &#8230; more deeply into Visual Studio and Team System&#8221;.  </li>
<li>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/08/Morning+Coffee+41+TechFest+Edition.aspx">mentioned</a> the Podcast Authoring tool that I saw at TechFest last week. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/microsofts-techfest-2007-randd-blowout/176053/">Here</a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/gallery/microsofts-techfest-2007-randd-blowout/176030/">are</a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/gallery/microsofts-techfest-2007-randd-blowout/176074/">some</a> pictures of it from engadget (via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lokeuei">Loke Uei Tan</a>) </li>
<li>I&#8217;ve been thinking of getting a Wii, and the fact I can <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/03/15/looking-for-sql-service-broker-users.aspx">hack code for it</a> &#8211; managed code for managed snobs no less &#8211; is just another good reason to do it.
