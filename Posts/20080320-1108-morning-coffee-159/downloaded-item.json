IPy lead developer Dino Viehand <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dinoviehland\/archive\/2008\/03\/17\/ironpython-ms-sql-and-pep-249.aspx\">posted a blog entry<\/a> (for the first time in 28 months!) showing the basic Python DB provider for SQL Server he put together. Hopefully, we won&#8217;t have to wait another two and a half years for Dino&#8217;s next post.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of IronPython, some of my new teammates pointed me to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.voidspace.org.uk\/voidspace\/index.shtml\">Michael Foord&#8217;s<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.voidspace.org.uk\/ironpython\/planet\/\">Planet IronPython aggregate news site<\/a>. Michael is IPy developer for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.resolversystems.com\/\">Resolver Systems<\/a> (the cool spreadsheet app hybrid <a href=\"http:\/\/www.devhawk.net\/2008\/01\/31\/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx\">I wrote about @ Lang.NET<\/a>) and he&#8217;s working on an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.manning.com\/foord\">IPy book<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Still speaking of IPy, Jeff Hardy <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.ironpython.com\/pipermail\/users-ironpython.com\/2008-March\/006649.html\">dropped his first release<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/NWSGI\">NWSGI<\/a>, an port of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.python.org\/dev\/peps\/pep-0333\/\">Python&#8217;s Web Service Gateway Interface<\/a> spec to ASP.NET and IPy. I can&#8217;t wait to see NWSGI combined Django running on IPy like <a href=\"http:\/\/unbracketed.org\/2008\/mar\/16\/pycon-2008-django-now-plays-dark-side\/\">Dino demoed @ PyCon<\/a>. Congrats Jeff! <\/li>\n<li>Scott Hanselman&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/TwitterTheUselessfulnessOfMicroblogging.aspx\">post on Twitter<\/a> reminds me that I recently started <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/devhawk\">twittering myself<\/a>. I haven&#8217;t worked it into my daily routine, so it gets updated only occasionally, but after reading Scott&#8217;s post, I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s cooler than it appears on the surface.\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li>In surprising news, Microsoft <a href=\"http:\/\/port25.technet.com\/archive\/2008\/03\/19\/supernova.aspx\">is going to start collaborating<\/a> with IBM&#8217;s Eclipse Foundation, to make it easier to it easier to write apps for Windows in Java. I would think this is a very cool thing, but apparently Ted Neward &#8211; who&#8217;s knowledge of JavaWorld far eclipses (ha ha) my own &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/03\/20\/Eclipse+Gets+Some+Help+Building+Windows+Apps+From+Microsoft.aspx\">thinks<\/a> &#8220;the skin here is just too sensitive&#8221; and that this move might cause more controversy between MS and Java. However, he seems to imply the controversy would be between MS &amp; Sun (Eclipse is obviously named as a jab @ Sun) rather than between MS &amp; the Java community. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>As you might expect, these morning coffee posts are going to get more dev focused as well as more IPy focused.
