<p>So I&#8217;m playing around with podcasting. The new version of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblogce">dasBlog</a> supports RSS enclosures for local binaries and I&#8217;m thinking of adding support for remote binaries. (I&#8217;m not sure my friend who hosts this blog for me would appreciate the bandwidth spike from adding downloads of media files. Of course, that assumes people would listen). So far, I&#8217;m just listening. My friend <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/">Mike </a>does his <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0141212/">Manic Minute</a> and I guess <a href="http://www.curry.com/">Daily Source Code</a> is the defacto standard podcast. This will be easier when I get my new AUX input installed in my car.</p>
<p>Listening to 30 minute podcasts like DSC on my Nomad have me longing for WMP&#8217;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/knowledgecenter/howto/PlayFaster_how_to.aspx">variable speed</a> feature. I listen to podcasts primarily on my Nomad &#8211; the combination of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/mp10/default.aspx">WMP 10</a>&nbsp;AutoSync, <a href="http://www.dopplerradio.net">Doppler Radio</a> and Sean&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.seanalexander.com/PermaLink,guid,88b882ce-dcad-4311-af2d-15732ba01292.aspx">podcast playlists</a>&nbsp;makes&nbsp;syncing&nbsp;down to my player effortless. But listening to Adam Curry ramble on about <a href="http://www.curry.com/2005/02/22#a2852">podcast commercialization</a>&nbsp;for 45 minutes doesn&#8217;t fit into my communte. However, listening to Adam Curry sped up 1.4x would make a 45 minute show end in just over 30 minutes. But alas, the Nomad doesn&#8217;t have that feature. Does any player support that? Or does it take more proccessing power than these things are carrying around?</p>
<p>Note to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/tv/content/Solutions/Foundation/MSTV_Foundation_Main.mspx">MSTV Foundation</a> team &#8211; variable speed support would also be a great feature for the DVR. I wouldn&#8217;t watch 24 sped up, but I might watch the Daily Show that way. </p>
<p>UPDATE &#8211; I neglected to &#8220;give props&#8221; to <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/">my boss Norman</a> for convincing me to look at this whole podcasting thing in the first place. Given how little spare time I have these days, I&#8217;m not sure that I needed yet another hobby.&nbsp;On the other hand, not following your boss&#8217;s suggestions or giving him props is never good for the career! <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group552" alt=":)"> </p>
