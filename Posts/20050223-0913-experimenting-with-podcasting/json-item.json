The new version of <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/dasblogce\">dasBlog<\/a> supports RSS enclosures for local binaries and I&#8217;m thinking of adding support for remote binaries. (I&#8217;m not sure my friend who hosts this blog for me would appreciate the bandwidth spike from adding downloads of media files. Of course, that assumes people would listen). So far, I&#8217;m just listening. My friend <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mglehman\/\">Mike <\/a>does his <a href=\"http:\/\/radio.weblogs.com\/0141212\/\">Manic Minute<\/a> and I guess <a href=\"http:\/\/www.curry.com\/\">Daily Source Code<\/a> is the defacto standard podcast. This will be easier when I get my new AUX input installed in my car.<\/p>\n<p>Listening to 30 minute podcasts like DSC on my Nomad have me longing for WMP&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/windowsmedia\/knowledgecenter\/howto\/PlayFaster_how_to.aspx\">variable speed<\/a> feature. I listen to podcasts primarily on my Nomad &#8211; the combination of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/windowsmedia\/mp10\/default.aspx\">WMP 10<\/a>\u00a0AutoSync, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dopplerradio.net\">Doppler Radio<\/a> and Sean&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.seanalexander.com\/PermaLink,guid,88b882ce-dcad-4311-af2d-15732ba01292.aspx\">podcast playlists<\/a>\u00a0makes\u00a0syncing\u00a0down to my player effortless. But listening to Adam Curry ramble on about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.curry.com\/2005\/02\/22#a2852\">podcast commercialization<\/a>\u00a0for 45 minutes doesn&#8217;t fit into my communte. However, listening to Adam Curry sped up 1.4x would make a 45 minute show end in just over 30 minutes. But alas, the Nomad doesn&#8217;t have that feature. Does any player support that? Or does it take more proccessing power than these things are carrying around?<\/p>\n<p>Note to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/tv\/content\/Solutions\/Foundation\/MSTV_Foundation_Main.mspx\">MSTV Foundation<\/a> team &#8211; variable speed support would also be a great feature for the DVR. I wouldn&#8217;t watch 24 sped up, but I might watch the Daily Show that way. <\/p>\n<p>UPDATE &#8211; I neglected to &#8220;give props&#8221; to <a href=\"http:\/\/atlasbrandview.blogspot.com\/\">my boss Norman<\/a> for convincing me to look at this whole podcasting thing in the first place. Given how little spare time I have these days, I&#8217;m not sure that I needed yet another hobby.\u00a0On the other hand, not following your boss&#8217;s suggestions or giving him props is never good for the career! <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group552\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So I&#8217;m playing around with podcasting.
