<ul><li>My friend Christoph Schittko (who used to blog <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cschittko/">here</a>, but hasn't written anything in almost two years) recently wrote on an internal email thread that he "wonder[s] how many more attempts for “enterprise wide” thingies we need for people to figure out that there’s too much complexity involved to coordinate anything enterprise wide." I couldn't agree more, though I think it's more than just complexity at work here. There are significant forces driving decentralization in society in general and IT in particular, and anything enterprise wide is by definition centralized. </li><li>I'm way behind on this, but Ray Ozzie did an <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1698">fascinating interview</a> with Knowledge@Wharton. I was especially interested in his separation of "big-I" and "small-i" innovation. Sounds like disruptive and sustaining innovation from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Management-Innovation/dp/0875845851">The Innovator's Dilemma</a> to me. </li><li>According to <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=385">Mary Jo Foley</a>, my ex-teammate <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikewalker/">Mike Walker</a> is "da man" on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikewalker/archive/2007/03/29/what-are-obas.aspx">Office Business Applications</a>, or OBA's. </li><li>I think I have an old PocketPC hanging around in a drawer somewhere. Apparently, I can use it as a <a href="http://www.binaryrefinery.com/main/PermaLink,guid,d8f9b0a3-f884-4a81-87e5-448d2beda19c.aspx">caller ID server</a> instead of gathering dust. That's sorta freaky.

Personally, I don't care one way or the other about Don Imus, but Mark's points about the conservatism of media corporations are spot on. </li></ul>
