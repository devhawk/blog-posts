<p>I just got back from the Weblogger&#8217;s BOF, which had impromptu meetings going on for an hour past the scheduled end time. Lots of great discussion, not a lot of agreement. There seem to be several threads of discussion. I spent a bunch of time with <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/">Peter Provost</a> &amp; <a href="http://objective.mine.nu/index.aspx">Chris Hollander</a> afterwards talking about how to scale a news aggregator to handle thousands of weblogs. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> reads over 600 and I don&#8217;t know how he keeps up with it. I did have to convince Peter that weblog discovery is not the issue &#8211; if something gets posted in blogsphere of value, chances are someone you read will link to it. That&#8217;s the nature of a highly interconnected network like blogsphere.</p>
<p>To top it off, I got to spend a while chatting with <a href="http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog/">Peter Drayton</a>, who seems <a href="http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog/2003/10/27.html#a387">poised</a> to return to blogging after a nine month absence. We chatted about Rotor, the CLR team, REST, ATOM and a replacement for Radio (dasBlog, of course). I think I&#8217;m going to need to spend a week on campus pinballing between offices once I get back from PDC.</p>
