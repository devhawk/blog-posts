<p>As I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/10/09/Hawkeye+On+Standard+WCF+Bindings.aspx">wrote this morning</a>, I&#8217;m in training this week. The instructor (who I wrote earlier is &#8220;pretty good&#8221;) is <a href="http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon/">Jon Flanders</a>. I didn&#8217;t recognize his name, but I did recognize his <a href="http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/atlasworkflowdesigner/">Atlas based WF Designer</a> that he released a month and a half ago or so. It&#8217;s a cool piece of work so it&#8217;s doubly cool (for me anyway) that he&#8217;s teaching this class.</p>
