As I [wrote this
morning](http://devhawk.net/2006/10/09/Hawkeye+On+Standard+WCF+Bindings.aspx),
I’m in training this week. The instructor (who I wrote earlier is
“pretty good”) is [Jon
Flanders](http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon/). I didn’t
recognize his name, but I did recognize his [Atlas based WF
Designer](http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/atlasworkflowdesigner/) that
he released a month and a half ago or so. It’s a cool piece of work so
it’s doubly cool (for me anyway) that he’s teaching this class.
