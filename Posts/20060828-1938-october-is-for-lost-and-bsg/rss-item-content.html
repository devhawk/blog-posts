<p>Wednesday Oct 4th is the season premier for <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/">Lost</a>. Two days later on Oct 6th is the season premier of <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a>. These are my favorite two shows - an in my opinion the best two - on TV right now. <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2006/08/28/Video_3A00_Battlestar-Galactica.aspx">According to Major Nelson</a>, a one hour recap of BSG called "The Story So Far" is available on XBLM. If they could post a Lost and the Lost Experience recap on XBLM, that would just be perfect.</p>
