<p>First it was at <a href="http://www.fredmeyer.com/">Fred Meyer</a> a week or two ago. Next it was at my <a href="http://sapporoteriyaki.com/">favorite teriyaki resturant</a> last Thursday. Then this past weekend, it happened again at <a href="http://remlingerfarms.com/">Remlinger Farms</a>. I think <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/about/instructors/instructorbios.aspx?id=3">Jeff Richter</a> is stalking me.</p>
