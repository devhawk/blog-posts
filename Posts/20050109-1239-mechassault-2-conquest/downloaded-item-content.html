<p align="left">First it was Halo 2&#8242;s online stats, game viewer and RSS feeds. Now, MechAssault 2 introduces the concept of <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/">Conquest</a>. While Halo 2&#8242;s online gaming experience is awesome, it doesn&#8217;t lead anywhere &#8211; each game is completely unrelated to the others. But with Conquest, each battle impacts the ownership of planets in the galaxy. Each player joins one of the <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/houses/">five houses</a> and then can participate in the galactic war. Planet ownership is based on the results of battles fought there. You can see the <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/map/">current map of the galaxy</a> as well as <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/updates/">war updates</a> at any time. (But no RSS feed for the war updates &#8211; what&#8217;s up with that?)</p>
<p align="left">The only bad thing is that MechAssault 2 doesn&#8217;t appear to have any per game stats like Halo 2 has. Wouldn&#8217;t that be a great experience &#8211; Halo 2&#8242;s game viewer and per game stats combined with MechAssault 2&#8242;s conquest metagame. </p>
