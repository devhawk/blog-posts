<p align="left">First it was Halo 2's online stats, game viewer and RSS feeds. Now, MechAssault 2 introduces the concept of <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/">Conquest</a>. While Halo 2's online gaming experience is awesome, it doesn't lead anywhere - each game is completely unrelated to the others. But with Conquest, each battle impacts the ownership of planets in the galaxy. Each player joins one of the <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/houses/">five houses</a> and then can participate in the galactic war. Planet ownership is based on the results of battles fought there. You can see the <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/map/">current map of the galaxy</a> as well as <a href="http://www.mechassault2.com/conquest/updates/">war updates</a> at any time. (But no RSS feed for the war updates - what's up with that?)</p><p align="left">The only bad thing is that MechAssault 2 doesn't appear to have any per game stats like Halo 2 has. Wouldn't that be a great experience - Halo 2's game viewer and per game stats combined with MechAssault 2's conquest metagame. </p>
