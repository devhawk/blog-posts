<p>Noah Horton, former teammate who has gone on to become PM in the Peer Networking Group, has started a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/noahh/">blog</a>. Of course, with the new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com">aggregated feed</a> of MSDN bloggers, you probably already knew that. However, I am compelled to blog this as Noah is a friend, works in the next building over from me and I've got a special <a href="http://devhawk.net/CategoryView.aspx?category=Development%7CP2P">interest in P2P</a>. I'm looking forward to his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/noahh/archive/2004/02/05/68256.aspx">promised tips and tricks</a>. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/noahh/Rss.aspx">Subscribed</a>.</p>
