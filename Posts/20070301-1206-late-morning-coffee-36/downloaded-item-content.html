<li>It snowed <em>again</em> yesterday. Last year we had one snowstorm, the year before that none. We&#8217;ve now had I think five this year plus the massive windstorm that knocked out power for days.</li>
<li>Technorati told me that &#8220;social news aggregator&#8221; Megite is <a href="http://www.megite.com/technology/1170964019/41">linking to me</a>. For some reason, <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/07/Perusing+Powershell+Part+2+Error+Or+No+Output.aspx">this post of mine</a> on Powershell is considered&nbsp;related to &#8220;<a href="http://www.strumpette.com/archives/300-Is-PR-Too-Stupid-for-Conversational-Marketing.html">Is PR Too Stupid for Conversational Marketing?</a>&#8221; from <a href="http://www.strumpette.com/">Amanda Chapel</a>. Seems like Megite has some bugs to work out.</li>
<li>Paul Andrew <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2007/02/25/Microsoft-provides-BPEL-2.0-in-WF-_2D00_-BPEL-for-Windows-Workflow-Foundation-March-CTP.aspx">announces</a> BPEL support for WF but David Chappel <a href="http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/2007/02/windows-workflow-foundation-and-bpel.html">writes</a> &#8220;no one should interpret the announcement as an embrace of BPEL-based development by Microsoft&#8221;. Personally, I think BPEL is just the latest attempt at &#8220;write once, run anywhere&#8221; and will meet with the same limited success of previous attempts. The last thing I think MSFT should do is embrace BPEL based development.</li>
<li>BPEL actually has two flavors, Executable and Abstract. Abstract BPEL is potentially fairly useful. You could use to exchange of the publicly viewable parts of a process with a partner in order to make two processes work together. That&#8217;s fairly exciting. I would welcome Abstract BPEL support for WF and/or BTS. But as far as I can tell, most of the BPEL focus has been around Executable BPEL, which as I wrote above&nbsp;is attempting to be a platform independent language for implementing business process. That&#8217;s fairly unexciting since we&#8217;ve been down this road before many times (UNIX, CORBA, J2EE) and it has never worked out. </li>
<li>Soma <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/03/01/beginner-developer-learning-center-launched.aspx">announces</a> the launch of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/">Beginner Developer Learning Center</a>. It includes <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/kids/">Kid&#8217;s Corner</a>&nbsp;with the cutely named <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/kids/csharp">C# for Sharp Kids</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/kids/vb">VB for Very Bright Kids</a>&nbsp;e-books. Very cool, I can&#8217;t wait to share this with my kids in a few years. Only complaint: where&#8217;s the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/xna/">XNA</a> love?</li>
