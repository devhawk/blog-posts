-   It snowed *again* yesterday. Last year we had one snowstorm, the
    year before that none. We’ve now had I think five this year plus the
    massive windstorm that knocked out power for days.
-   Technorati told me that “social news aggregator” Megite is [linking
    to me](http://www.megite.com/technology/1170964019/41). For some
    reason, [this post of
    mine](http://devhawk.net/2007/02/07/perusing-powershell-part-2-error-or-no-output/)
    on Powershell is considered related to “[Is PR Too Stupid for
    Conversational
    Marketing?](http://www.strumpette.com/archives/300-Is-PR-Too-Stupid-for-Conversational-Marketing.html)”
    from [Amanda Chapel](http://www.strumpette.com/). Seems like Megite
    has some bugs to work out.

    BPEL support for WF but David Chappel
    [writes](http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/2007/02/windows-workflow-foundation-and-bpel.html)
    “no one should interpret the announcement as an embrace of
    BPEL-based development by Microsoft”. Personally, I think BPEL is
    just the latest attempt at “write once, run anywhere” and will meet
    with the same limited success of previous attempts. The last thing I
    think MSFT should do is embrace BPEL based development.
-   BPEL actually has two flavors, Executable and Abstract. Abstract
    BPEL is potentially fairly useful. You could use to exchange of the
    publicly viewable parts of a process with a partner in order to make
    two processes work together. That’s fairly exciting. I would welcome
    Abstract BPEL support for WF and/or BTS. But as far as I can tell,
    most of the BPEL focus has been around Executable BPEL, which as I
    wrote above is attempting to be a platform independent language for
    implementing business process. That’s fairly unexciting since we’ve
    been down this road before many times (UNIX, CORBA, J2EE) and it has
    never worked out.

    the launch of the [Beginner Developer Learning
    Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/). It
    includes [Kid’s
    Corner](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/kids/) with
    the cutely named [C\# for Sharp
    Kids](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/kids/csharp)
    and [VB for Very Bright
    Kids](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/beginner/kids/vb) e-books.
    Very cool, I can’t wait to share this with my kids in a few years.
    Only complaint: where’s the [XNA](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/xna/)
    love?
