  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Harry,

I just realized I misread your original post and didn't notice that you were delivering all messages in a single conversation group to a single workflow instance. In that case, you're probably maintaining ordered processing. FWIW, seems you're implementing the kind of solution that is usually handled in Biztalk through a feature known as Convoys (look them up, the details might be useful to you at least for ideas, I think)

BTW, the BizTalk MessageBox is far more than SSB, though they share some features, I think. Mostly, the MsgBox does not only queuing, it's also the underlying Pub/Sub and content-based routing engine in BizTalk. I do think it might be possible to implement the message box on top of SSB, and maybe the BizTalk team might explore that for possible performance improvements in future releases. 

And yes, I realize I'm a pita sometimes nagging about biztalk (but I do think for the kind of work you're doing, knowing how biztalk manages some of it would prove useful).]]></wp:comment_content>
