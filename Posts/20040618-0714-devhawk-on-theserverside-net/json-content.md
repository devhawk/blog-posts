[TSS.net](http://www.theserverside.net) just published a new [Tech
Talk](http://www.theserverside.net/talks/index.tss), [this
time](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=26644) with
yours truly. Tech Talks are interviews with “.NET luminaries” (their
name). Previous talks on TSS.net include
[Pat](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland) and
[Simon](http://www.simonguest.com/) from my team as well as others such
as [Don Box](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx) and [Scott
Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/). Nice company to be in!

The interview is pretty broad reaching – we spend thirty minutes about
architecture (with a lower case a), community, patterns, aspects,
messaging, service oriented way plus job advice for
[Ted’s](http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog) 10 year old son.
