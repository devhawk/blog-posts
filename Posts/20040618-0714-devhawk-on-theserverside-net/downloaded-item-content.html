<p><a href="http://www.theserverside.net">TSS.net</a> just published a new <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/talks/index.tss">Tech Talk</a>, <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=26644">this time</a> with yours truly. Tech Talks are interviews with &#8220;.NET luminaries&#8221; (their name). Previous talks on TSS.net include <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland">Pat</a> and <a href="http://www.simonguest.com/">Simon</a> from my team as well as others such as <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx">Don Box</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a>. Nice company to be in! </p>
<p>The interview is pretty broad reaching &#8211; we&nbsp;spend thirty minutes&nbsp;about architecture (with a lower case a), community, patterns, aspects, messaging, service oriented way plus job advice for <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog">Ted&#8217;s</a> 10 year old son. </p>
