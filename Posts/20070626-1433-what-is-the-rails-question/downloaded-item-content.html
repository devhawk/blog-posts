<p>Nick Malik asked &#8220;what is the Rails &#8220;answer&#8221; on the Microsoft platform? If we don&#8217;t install Ruby, do we use Rails on JS or is there a Rails version we may want to put up ourselves?&#8221; I guess it depends, what is the Rails &#8220;question&#8221;? </p>
<p>On the one hand, the question could be &#8220;What&#8217;s the best way to run Rails on Windows?&#8221; I think the short answer to that is <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/04/introducing_iro.html">IronRuby</a>. In the wake of the IronRuby announcement, John Lam <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=305092#305092">wrote</a> that &#8220;Nobody would take our implementation seriously if it doesn&#8217;t run Rails.&#8221; <a href="http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2007/06/there-can-be-only-one-tale-about-ruby.html">Some</a><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RubyMicrosoft.html">people</a> question the DLR&#8217;s teams ability to ship a compatible version of Ruby without looking at the source, but my money is on the DLR team. (Of course it is, I&#8217;m a kool-aid drinker!)</p>
<p>BTW, I don&#8217;t think having a JavaScript port of Rails (JailS?) is much of a help for the Microsoft platform. I&#8217;m not sure if Steve Yegge&#8217;s JavaScript Rails port would run on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript_.NET">JScript.NET</a>, but I wouldn&#8217;t bet on it. I would expect you need either the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript">Active Scripting JScript</a> or the new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jscript/archive/2007/05/07/introducing-managed-jscript.aspx">Managed JScript</a> (aka the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/archive/2007/04/30/a-dynamic-language-runtime-dlr.aspx">DLR</a> based version of JavaScript). Of course, IronRuby runs on DLR as well so why wouldn&#8217;t you just run Rails on IronRuby instead of the JavaScript port of Rails on Managed JScript? </p>
<p>(Side note &#8211; why isn&#8217;t the new JScript engine called IronJavaScript? Wouldn&#8217;t that be cooler than Managed JScript? Don&#8217;t they know &#8220;Iron&#8221; is the new &#8220;#&#8221;?)</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe the question is &#8220;can ASP.NET evolve to be more Rails-esque?&#8221; I think it&#8217;s starting to, slowly. Rails at it&#8217;s core is a <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/modelViewController.html">Model View Controller</a> web app pattern (aka <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html">Action Pack</a>) combined with an <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html">Active Record</a> data access pattern (aka <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html">Rails&#8217; Active Record</a>). Certainly, nothing stops you from using a similar approach with ASP.NET. The Castle Project has an ASP.NET implementation of MVC (aka <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html">MonoRail</a>) and Active Record (also called <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/index.html">Active Record</a>). But I assume Nick&#8217;s more interested in what ships natively in the platform to compare to Rails.</p>
<p>On the data access side, I think LINQ to SQL is a a compelling alternative to the various Active Record implementations. It&#8217;s not an implementation of the Active Record pattern, it looks more like a <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/tableDataGateway.html">Table Data Gateway</a> patten. Also, it&#8217;s not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRY">DRY</a> like Rails Active Record, but I think that&#8217;s more of a function of dynamic vs. static languages. Castle Active Record <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/index.html">isn&#8217;t DRY</a> either. But once you get the hang of the slightly funky syntax (the from clause is first so you can get intellisense) I find LINQ very easy to use. Certainly, building <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/queryObject.html">Query Objects</a> is a snap. </p>
<p>On the web app framework side, the story isn&#8217;t so pretty. The agile folks like MVC because it&#8217;s <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/03/07/Jay_2700_s-TDD-QuickStart_2C00_-and-the-underlying-problems-he-stumbled-into.aspx">easier to test</a> (among other reasons &#8211; see update below). Apparently, there&#8217;s an ASP.NET MVC framework that&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/03/16/Big-News-_2D00_-MVC-framework-for-ASP.NET-in-the-works-_2D00_-level-300.aspx">in the works</a>&#8220;, but AFAIK no one has seen or heard anything about it since the MVP summit. <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/default.aspx">Jeffrey Palermo</a> was impressed with what he saw, but I guess everyone else has to reserve judgement until it gets a little more public.</p>
<p>Actually, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an either-or question, it&#8217;s both. In order to be the <em><u>Common</u></em> Language Runtime, I think it needs to support common dynamic languages like Ruby, Python and JavaScript natively. And, in order to be the best platform, I think the .NET Framework in general and ASP.NET in particular need to support multiple approaches to meet the needs of different developers. </p>
<p>UPDATE &#8211; in the <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,c444e0c2-f9e8-4625-b12a-7a4c00f859e8.aspx#commentstart">comments</a>, <a href="http://www.jeffreypalermo.com/">Jeffrey Palermo</a> points out that he likes MVC &#8220;mostly because it separates concerns of controlling screen and rendering the screen. It makes the application more maintainable and keeps the code easily changeable.&#8221; Point taken. I didn&#8217;t mean to imply that testability was the only virtue of MVC.</p>
