<p>I got my <a href="https://www.lingo.com/">Lingo</a> phone set up last night. It was mind-numbingly easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ignore included directions which tell you to turn off the computer, router and cable modem. (maybe you unplug the microwave just to be sure)</li>
<li>Plug Lingo VoIP box into router</li>
<li>Plug Lingo VoIP box into phone</li>
<li>Plug Lingo VoIP box into power outlet</li>
<li>Wait for VoIP light to come on</li>
</ol>
<p>We made a few calls, both locally and to our family &amp; friends in Europe. I couldn&#8217;t hear any difference in quality from our normal land line. We&#8217;re going to run with both in parallel for a while, and then I&#8217;m going to cut back the services on the land line. I figure I don&#8217;t want to shut it off completely for SLA reasons &#8211; it works when the power&#8217;s out and in the very rare occasions that the internet connection is down. Otherwise, I figure I&#8217;ll be completely switched over in a month or so.</p>
<p>BTW, like other VoIP vendors, Lingo offers incentives to sign up your friends. If you want Lingo and an extra $25 credit, <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net?subject=I Want Lingo">drop me a line</a>.</p>
