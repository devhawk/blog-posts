<p>When web servers were first built, there was a one-to-one mapping between virtual files (i.e. addressable via http)&nbsp;and the physical files (the ones in the file system). Over time, two important capabilities were added. First, the contents of a given file became dynamic. So while you the reader always come back to default.aspx (or rss.aspx as the case may be) the content changes everytime I post something new. Secondly, the physical file dependency was removed. It&#8217;s not used much in dasBlog, but in .TEXT this is very prevelant. My <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk/archive/2005/02/01/364380.aspx">last post</a> on blogs.msdn.com is located at http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk/archive/2005/02/01/364380.aspx. Obviously, there is no actual file named 364380.aspx, .TEXT uses the filename as a key into the DB to find the actual entry content. This technique is used extensively in the new <a href="msdn2.microsoft.com">MSDN2</a> (if you haven&#8217;t already, check out <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/default.aspx">Tim Ewald&#8217;s</a> MSDN Magazine <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/02/InsideMSDN/default.aspx">article</a> about URL design for MSDN2).</p>
<p>So now for the funky idea part &#8211; why couldn&#8217;t we generate dynamic local files the same way? I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve got a great use for this yet &#8211; most of the apps I use are programmable to some extent, so dynamic content can be generated at the app level rather than at the file system level. But I&#8217;m thinking there may be some scenarios where it would make sense to do this at the file system. For example, in the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/offers/details.aspx?displaylang=en&OfferId=74AA1C1D-DFFC-4D91-BC6F-515BE8E59948">Winter Fun Pack</a> there&#8217;s a new version of the WMP blogging plugin that autoupdates the Outlook and Outlook Express signature files whenever the song being played changes (a la Duncan&#8217;s Coding4Fun <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun09072004.asp">article</a>). But with virtual files in the file system, you could generate these files when they are accessed instead of writing new ones everytime the song changes, even if Outlook open.</p>
<p>Of course, our local file system typically has more writing activity than the web, so I&#8217;m thinking this isn&#8217;t that great an idea. But I figured I&#8217;d share in case someone else could think of some good uses. Or maybe this already exists and I just don&#8217;t know about it.</p>
