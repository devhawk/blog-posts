  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Humm i think Linux (i'm sure other unixes have it too) has this, /proc/* for example. But this is done at a kernel level, not sure if such thing exists at the user process level, i bet there is something. But if there isn't i sure it would be an easy hack.

What kind of semantics were you thinking? would these virtual files be seekable? how would they be versioned? what kind of concurrency controls would need to exist? 

Sure pull instead of push (with a lot of unnecessary pushing ocurring in your described scenario) is nice, but i wonder if the effort would be worth it?

just wondering.]]></wp:comment_content>
