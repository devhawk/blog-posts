A customer who reads my blog (and I think would rate me in the 7-9 range) sent me links to an <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item.jhtml?id=3583&amp;t=organizations"> article</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060391685/002-4873027-5920803"> book</a> on Storytelling. The .NET &amp; web services vision makes a great story. If you look at my <a href="presentations/net_vision.ppt">old .NET Vision PPT</a>, there is a real-world integration scenario. There are two slides - how it's done today, and how it would be done with web services. I haven't thought about it in terms of protagonists and antagonists, but the foundation is there.
