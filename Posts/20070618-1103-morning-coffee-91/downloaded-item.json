I&#8217;m a very lucky man. <\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m starting to really dig <a href=\"http:\/\/www.safaribooksonline.com\/\">Safari Books Online<\/a>. Having a tablet really helps here, I can sit in bed and read and it&#8217;s ALMOST like reading a real book. Is there an offline experience? Something like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/NYTimesReaderWPFsFirstKillerApp.aspx\">NYTimes WPF Reader app<\/a> would be killer.  <\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m not a Twitter guy, but I like the idea of using it to <a href=\"http:\/\/thomasfreudenberg.com\/blog\/archive\/2007\/06\/17\/twitter-publisher-for-cruisecontrol-net.aspx\">publish CI results<\/a>. Not quite as cool as using the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mswanson\/articles\/169058.aspx\">Ambient Orb<\/a>, but close. (via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dotnetkicks.com\/opensource\/Twitter_Publisher_for_CruiseControl_NET\">DotNetKicks<\/a>)  <\/li>\n<li>Soma <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/somasegar\/archive\/2007\/06\/18\/so-what-does-microsoft-use-for-software-development.aspx\">details<\/a> the dogfood usage of TFS in Developer Division. Sorta interesting if you&#8217;re into knowing that stuff. <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/bharry\/\">Brian Harry<\/a> apparently has much more.  <\/li>\n<li>I realize that linking to Pat Helland every time he writes something is fairly redundant. If you want <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/pathelland\/rss.xml\">his feed<\/a>, you know where to find it. But he writes great stuff! The latest is <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/pathelland\/archive\/2007\/06\/14\/accountants-don-t-use-erasers.aspx\">Accountants Don&#8217;t Use Erasers<\/a>, which talks about append-only computing. His point that the database is a cache of the transaction log is mind blowing, yet makes total sense.  <\/li>\n<li>Bruce Payette <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/powershell\/archive\/2007\/06\/18\/using-a-dsl-to-generate-xml-in-powershell.aspx\">blogs<\/a> a PS DSL for creating XML documents.  <\/li>\n<li>Jesus Rodriguez <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/gsusx\/archive\/2007\/06\/14\/orcas-durable-services.aspx\">details<\/a> WCF&#8217;s new Durable Service support in .NET 3.5. I get the need for the [DurableServiceBehavior] attribute, but do I really have to adorn each of the service methods with [DurableOperationBehavior] too? That seems redundant. Also, I wonder how this looks at the channel layer?  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of WCF&#8217;s channel layer, I recently picked up a copy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/mspress\/books\/9610.aspx\">Inside Windows Communication Foundation<\/a>\u00a0by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wintellect.com\/cs\/blogs\/jsmith\/default.aspx\">Justin Smith<\/a>. This is the first book I&#8217;ve found that has more coverage of the channel layer than the service layer, so I like it.  <\/li>\n<li>Dare <a href=\"http:\/\/www.25hoursaday.com\/weblog\/2007\/06\/16\/Web3SARESTfulProtocolForAccessingWindowsLiveServices.aspx\">writes<\/a> about <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.live.com\/livedata\/web3s.htm\">Web3S<\/a>, Windows Live&#8217;s general purpose REST protocol. Apparently, WL <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goland.org\/appanddare\/\">started with Atom Publishing Protocol<\/a>, but found that it didn&#8217;t meet their needs around hierarchy and granular updates. David Ing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.from9till2.com\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6fbc1aec-8096-4e21-a015-12ede6fc9646\">says<\/a> it&#8217;s &#8220;not that similar&#8221; to my concept of REST,\u00a0but I going to read the spec before I comment. <\/li>\n<li>Scott Hanselman <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/ScottHanselman\/~3\/125204676\/TeachingChildrenAndKidsToProgramTheOldSchoolWay.aspx\">writes<\/a> about how he learned to program and some thoughts about teaching his son. Patrick has recently started expressing interest in programming (he want&#8217;s to do what Daddy does). At four, I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;ll start him on <a href=\"http:\/\/llk.media.mit.edu\/projects.php?id=783\">Scratch<\/a> (though <a href=\"http:\/\/www.toontalk.com\/\">ToonTalk<\/a> looks interesting). As he gets older, I was thinking about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.squeak.org\/\">Squeak<\/a>, though I&#8217;m a smalltalk noob. I really like Scott&#8217;s idea of creating a connection to the physical world via something like <a href=\"http:\/\/mindstorms.lego.com\/\">Mindstorms<\/a>. Patrick loves Lego almost as much as his dad, so that would be cool.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>My wife loves me. I&#8217;m a very lucky man. I&#8217;m starting to really dig Safari Books Online.
