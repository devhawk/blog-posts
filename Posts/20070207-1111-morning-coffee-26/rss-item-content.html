<ul><li>I wonder what MSBuild would look like if the team had <strike>cloned</strike> drawn inspiration from <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html">Rake</a> instead of <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>.

Frankly, I think that gives UDDI a lot more credit than it's due. We're looking at UDDI as part of our SO infrastructure project, and I think it's more appropriately called "one piece of the puzzle". In my experience, the major roadblock getting projects to share technical details is desire, not discoverability. Getting information into the registry is much easier than getting teams to use that data rather than succumbing to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">Not Invented Here</a> syndrome.
