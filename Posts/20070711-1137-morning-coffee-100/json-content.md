-   Last night was the Microsoft E3 Briefing. Gamerscore blog has the
    [news
    rundown](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/07/10/NewsfromBriefing.aspx).
    Didn’t seem to be any HUGE news. Last year’s E3 was the first Halo 3
    showing and X06 featured the Halo Wars announcement. Nothing that
    earth-shaking this time, though the XBLM keeps on rolling, [now
    featuring Disney

    (Major Nelson [has a
    list](http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/07/11/disney-now-on-video-marketplace.aspx).)
    I’m thinking that the whole HD-DVD vs. BluRay war is going to be
    eclipsed by direct download before it’s over, though I’m still
    waiting for PC support & all-you-can-eat pricing.
-   Politics 2.0 Watch: Clay Shirky has a [great blog
    post](http://many.corante.com/archives/2007/07/09/andrew_keen_rescuing_luddite_from_the_luddites.php)
    on modern-day Luddites. As he points out: “A Luddite argument is one
    in which some broadly useful technology is opposed on the grounds
    that it will discomfort the people who benefit from the inefficiency
    the technology destroys.” How much inefficiency is there in our
    modern political system? And more importantly, who benefits from
    that inefficiency? We’ve already seen the dramatic effects blogs can
    have on political news, media and reporting. What happens when
    ~~users~~ citizens are no longer satisfied just writing about the
    political process and want to get their hands dirty in the
    policy-making process itself?
