<li>The big 100. This puts be <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1183.aspx">1083 posts</a> behind Iron Link Poster Mike Gunderloy. As his <a href="http://afreshcup.com/2007/7/3/progress-report">.NET skills deteriorate</a>, maybe I can catch up&#8230;but I doubt it. I&#8217;m only <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/07/11/new-and-notable-177.aspx">77 posts</a> behind Sam Gentile, so maybe that&#8217;s a bit more feasible.&nbsp; </li>
<li>The ADO.NET Team blog <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2007/07/02/ado-net-entity-framework-june-2007-ctp-now-available.aspx">announces</a> the new Entity Framework CTP. Looks like there&#8217;s also a new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e6fd8663-8b77-4649-8d36-3830e18528fa&DisplayLang=en">.NET Framework 3.5 CTP</a> and new <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/c/e/bcea0399-5dd8-4d02-a125-c02cf331b86b/vnssetup.exe">Visual Web Developer &#8220;Orcas&#8221; Express CTP</a> as well.

<li>Speaking of <strike>&#8220;Orcas&#8221;</strike> VS 2008, it <a href="http://dotnetsamplechapters.blogspot.com/2007/07/windows-server-2008-visual-studio-2008.html">launches</a> with Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 next February.

<li>My friend Arvidra Semhi recently <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/asehmi/archive/2007/06/20/moved-my-blog-to-msdn.aspx">moved and rebooted</a> his blog. Among his many accomplishments, Arvindra <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/asehmi/archive/2007/06/20/journal-completes-4-seasons.aspx">started</a> the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/arcjournal">Architecture Journal</a>. I&#8217;m particularly interested in his recent <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/asehmi/archive/2007/06/22/content-for-my-teched-us-2007-talks.aspx">Service Capsule</a> work. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/asehmi/rss.xml">Subscribed</a>.  </li>
<li>Last night was the Microsoft E3 Briefing. Gamerscore blog has the <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/07/10/NewsfromBriefing.aspx">news rundown</a>. Didn&#8217;t seem to be any HUGE news. Last year&#8217;s E3 was the first Halo 3 showing and X06 featured the Halo Wars announcement. Nothing that earth-shaking this time, though the XBLM keeps on rolling, <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/07/10/DisneyStudios.aspx">now featuring Disney movies</a>. (Major Nelson <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/07/11/disney-now-on-video-marketplace.aspx">has a list</a>.) I&#8217;m thinking that the whole HD-DVD vs. BluRay war is going to be eclipsed by direct download before it&#8217;s over, though I&#8217;m still waiting for PC support &amp; all-you-can-eat pricing. </li>
<li>Politics 2.0 Watch: Clay Shirky has a <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2007/07/09/andrew_keen_rescuing_luddite_from_the_luddites.php">great blog post</a> on modern-day Luddites. As he points out: &#8220;A Luddite argument is one in which some broadly useful technology is opposed on the grounds that it will discomfort the people who benefit from the inefficiency the technology destroys.&#8221; How much inefficiency is there in our modern political system? And more importantly, who benefits from that inefficiency? We&#8217;ve already seen the dramatic effects blogs can have on political news, media and reporting. What happens when <strike>users</strike> citizens are no longer satisfied just writing about the political process and want to get their hands dirty in the policy-making process itself?</li>
