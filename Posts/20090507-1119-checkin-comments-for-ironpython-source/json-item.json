When I joined the team last April, we we only pushing the source about twice a month (sometimes only once a month). By last July, we were pushing source about once a week. Since mid-January, we\u2019ve pushed out the latest source 131 times, which comes to about once a day on average since the start of the year. Big kudos to <a href=\"http:\/\/knowbody.livejournal.com\/\">Dave Fugate<\/a>, who\u2019s primarily responsible for improving the frequency of our source code drops.<\/p>\n<p>However, while we\u2019ve been good about source code drop frequency, we haven\u2019t been good about transparency. All those source drops have the same less-than-useful checkin comment \u201cLatest IP sources migrated to CodePlex TFS\u201d. If you wanted to know what was changed in a given changeset, you had to do the diff yourself.<\/p>\n<p>But all that opaque code changes is a thing of the past now. Dave upgraded out source push script so that it emails a list of changes as well as the checkin comments whenever we update the source on CodePlex. For example, check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.ironpython.com\/pipermail\/users-ironpython.com\/2009-May\/010275.html\">source push announcement<\/a> for our <a href=\"http:\/\/ironpython.codeplex.com\/SourceControl\/changeset\/view\/49849\">latest source drop<\/a>.\u00a0 Now we publish added, deleted and modified sources as well as the comments for any checkins included in the source drop. <\/p>\n<p>As Dave <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.ironpython.com\/pipermail\/users-ironpython.com\/2009-May\/010245.html\">said on the mailing list<\/a>, please let us know if you have any feedback on these source update emails. I think they\u2019re awesome (though I did have <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.ironpython.com\/pipermail\/users-ironpython.com\/2009-May\/010277.html\">one small suggestion<\/a>) but we want to know what you think. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We\u2019ve been slowly but surely increasing the frequency of IronPython source drops.
