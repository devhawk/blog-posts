<p>We’ve been slowly but surely increasing the frequency of IronPython source drops. When I joined the team last April, we we only pushing the source about twice a month (sometimes only once a month). By last July, we were pushing source about once a week. Since mid-January, we’ve pushed out the latest source 131 times, which comes to about once a day on average since the start of the year. Big kudos to <a href="http://knowbody.livejournal.com/">Dave Fugate</a>, who’s primarily responsible for improving the frequency of our source code drops.</p><p>However, while we’ve been good about source code drop frequency, we haven’t been good about transparency. All those source drops have the same less-than-useful checkin comment “Latest IP sources migrated to CodePlex TFS”. If you wanted to know what was changed in a given changeset, you had to do the diff yourself.</p><p>But all that opaque code changes is a thing of the past now. Dave upgraded out source push script so that it emails a list of changes as well as the checkin comments whenever we update the source on CodePlex. For example, check out the <a href="http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2009-May/010275.html">source push announcement</a> for our <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/49849">latest source drop</a>.  Now we publish added, deleted and modified sources as well as the comments for any checkins included in the source drop. </p><p>As Dave <a href="http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2009-May/010245.html">said on the mailing list</a>, please let us know if you have any feedback on these source update emails. I think they’re awesome (though I did have <a href="http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2009-May/010277.html">one small suggestion</a>) but we want to know what you think. </p>
