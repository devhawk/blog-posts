Of course, what he <em>really<\/em> means is that Messaging <em>with WCF<\/em> is not a Transaction. Messaging with SSB is in fact a transaction (well, more accurately, it&#8217;s transactional but you get the idea). Nick&#8217;s right that you may not need anything more than simple retry semantics that you can implement yourself in your application protocol. But SSB has spoiled me. Why should <em>I<\/em> have to write the retry semantics? Why can&#8217;t my messaging stack provide that for me? Or put another way, if I need a &#8220;precicely defined failure model&#8221;, wouldn&#8217;t I be better of choosing a messaging stack that provides that out of the box?<\/li>\n<li>Steve Hartman <a href=\"http:\/\/stevenharman.net\/blog\/archive\/2007\/04\/03\/Using-Virtual-PC-with-Multiple-Monitors-Sort-Of.aspx\">explains<\/a> how to use span Remote Desktop Connection across multiple monitors for use with VPC.

I wonder how well this will work for Microsoft given that both Zune and PlaysForSure provide subscription services. I would assume the $15 all-you-can-listen style subscription services wouldn&#8217;t be DRM free. Given that program is one of the (few) selling points they have over Apple, will the availablity of DRM Free music undercut the interest in subscription?
