I just hit the MSDN home page, and what should I see?

[![msdn Home](http://s3.amazonaws.com/devhawk_images/WindowsLiveWriter/IronPythonRTMNewsGetsAround_EC8A/msdn%20Home_3.png "msdn Home")](http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonz/archive/2008/12/11/ironpython-2-0-released.aspx) 

It’s cool to see JasonZ, aka my group’s general manager,
[blogging](http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonz/archive/2008/12/11/ironpython-2-0-released.aspx)
about our product.

I also fired up Visual Studio, and
[IronPython](http://codeplex.com/ironpython) is the top headline there
too:

Not sure why the news is dated September 18th, but hey it’s really cool to
see IronPython (not to mention the [DLR](http://www.codeplex.com/dlr),
with the second headline) getting this kind of visibility.
