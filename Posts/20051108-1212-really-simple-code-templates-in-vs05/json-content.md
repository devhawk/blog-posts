the Export Templates Wizard from VS05. Very cool. Frankly, I like
[GAT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/workshop/gat) for
most of this type of template work, but this really fits nicely from a
[simplest thing that could possibly
work](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork)‚Äù
perspective.
