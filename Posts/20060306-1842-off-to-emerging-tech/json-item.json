I&#8217;m here thru Thursday which is the longest I&#8217;ve been gone from home since TechEd last year. And I&#8217;m only home eight days before heading off to SPARK and MIX for an even longer trip. Well, the SPARK\/MIX trip is just one day longer than ETech. But a day can seem like an eternity to my three year old son who was predicting &#8220;Daddy come home in one minute&#8221; as I was pulling out of the driveway.<\/p>\n<p>I skipped the <a href=\"http:\/\/conferences.oreillynet.com\/pub\/w\/43\/tutorials.html\">pre-confernece tutorials<\/a>, though several looked interesting. I&#8217;m really looking forward to hearing <a href=\"http:\/\/conferences.oreillynet.com\/cs\/et2006\/view\/e_sess\/8466\">Bruce Sterling<\/a> speak tonight.<\/p>\n<p>And for those keeping track of my travel shenanigans with Alaska Airlines, no problems with the flight today. Apparently they only screw up when I&#8217;m in a hurry. And even better news is that I&#8217;ve re-earned my MVP status. I used to fly with them all the time, but then with the new role and new baby I just didn&#8217;t fly much last year. But they had some &#8220;quick earning&#8221; program that let me re-earn my status. They even gave me MVP status for the flight today, so I got to sit in first class. Crowded flight too, so it was nice. Of course, in what has become true Alaska Air style, I had to wait on hold and deal with a subordanant flunky for twenty minutes before I could talk to a supervisor who could get me registered into the quick MVP program, but it turned out OK so I guess I shouldn&#8217;t complain.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I flew down to San Diego for the Emerging Technology Conference today.
