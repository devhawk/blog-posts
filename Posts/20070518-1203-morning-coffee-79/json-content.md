    [PopFly](http://www.popfly.ms),
    the “fun, easy way to build and share mashups, gadgets, Web pages,
    and applications” from the [Non-Professional tools
    team](http://www.popfly.ms/Overview/About.aspx). The PopFly [team
    blog](http://popflyteam.spaces.live.com) has [some
    videos](http://popflyteam.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!51018025071FD37F!131.entry).
    Sounds vaguely like [Yahoo! Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com), but
    cooler. While most of the focus is on their [browser-based mashup
    creator](http://www.popfly.ms/Overview/Default.aspx), they also have
    [VS support](http://www.popfly.ms/Overview/Explorer.aspx) for the
    non-non-professionals among us.

    [suggests](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericnel/archive/2007/05/16/microsoft-crm-microsoft-business-application-platform.aspx)
    that the new Dynamics CRM systems is actually a LOB application
    platform in it’s own right. More details in [Ben Riga’s MIX
    session](http://sessions.visitmix.com/default.asp?event=1011&session=2012&pid=DEV09&disc=&id=1518&year=2007&search=DEV09).

    [worried](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/05/18/new-and-notable-167.aspx)
    that C\# is becoming to complex, especially when you also consider
    how fast the platform is moving underneath. When you get your head
    out of the debugger for a second and look at the Big Picture, it
    certainly seems overwhelming. Is it just a question of getting used
    to it? The first time I fired up the VS.net 2002 alpha and looked at
    all the classes in the BCL, I had the same overwhelmed feeling, but
    eventually I got over it. Or have things just gotten too big and
    move to fast now? If so, it’s time for some new layers of
    abstraction…

    about building testable services. Testability has to be a core
    consideration when building anything, but especially a reusable
    framework. I’ve had similar thoughts about language design. How do
    you unit test a DSL?
-   Roberto Medrano of SOA Software
    [thinks](http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/05/14/20FEsoabottle-1_1.html)
    “maybe 20 percent of IT folks understand SOA and half of the rest
    think they do”. Personally, I think most IT folks don’t agree on
    what SOA is or should be. Furthermore, we don’t even have a common
    lexicon to discuss it, so we end up talking past each other and
    arguing about topics we agree on. I think Roberto is really saying
    is “most people are wrong because they don’t agree with what I think
    SOA is”. (via [Jack van

    [talks](http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2007/05/18/the-virtuous-cycle-net-developers-using-to-powershell.aspx)
    about the virtuous cycle of .NET language support. His point is that
    time spent learning .NET pays off as you transition between system
    programming (C\#, VB.NET), shell programming (PowerShell) and script
    programming (IronPython, DLR). I’m not sure I would break them down
    that way, but his point spot on.
-   Clemens Vasters experiments with the new [BizTalk
    Services](http://labs.biztalk.net/) with a sample called
    [TweetieBot](http://blogs.msdn.com/clemensv/archive/2007/05/16/tweetiebot-a-biztalk-services-experiment.aspx).
    I agree 100% with his point about the assumption of centralization
    will be challenged by the federation of personal services.
