More details in <a href=\"http:\/\/sessions.visitmix.com\/default.asp?event=1011&amp;session=2012&amp;pid=DEV09&amp;disc=&amp;id=1518&amp;year=2007&amp;search=DEV09\">Ben Riga&#8217;s MIX session<\/a>.

When you get your head out of the debugger for a second and look at the Big Picture, it certainly seems overwhelming. Is it just a question of getting used to it? The first time I fired up the VS.net 2002 alpha and looked at all the classes in the BCL, I had the same overwhelmed feeling, but eventually I got over it. Or have things just gotten too big and move to fast now? If so, it&#8217;s time for some new layers of abstraction&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Udi Dahan <a href=\"http:\/\/udidahan.weblogs.us\/2007\/05\/17\/testing-services-the-hard-way-with-wcf\/\">writes<\/a> about building testable services. Testability has to be a core consideration when building anything, but especially a reusable framework. I&#8217;ve had similar thoughts about language design. How do you unit test a DSL? <\/li>\n<li>Roberto Medrano of SOA Software <a href=\"http:\/\/www.infoworld.com\/article\/07\/05\/14\/20FEsoabottle-1_1.html\">thinks<\/a> &#8220;maybe 20 percent of IT folks understand SOA and half of the rest think they do&#8221;. Personally, I think most IT folks don&#8217;t agree on what SOA is or should be. Furthermore, we don&#8217;t even have a common lexicon to discuss it, so we end up talking past each other and arguing about topics we agree on. I think Roberto is really saying is &#8220;most people are wrong because they don&#8217;t agree with what\u00a0I think SOA is&#8221;.

His point is that time spent learning .NET pays off as you transition between system programming\u00a0(C#, VB.NET), shell programming (PowerShell) and script programming (IronPython, DLR). I&#8217;m not sure I would break them down that way, but his point spot on. <\/li>\n<li>Clemens Vasters experiments with the new <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.biztalk.net\/\">BizTalk Services<\/a> with a sample called <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/clemensv\/archive\/2007\/05\/16\/tweetiebot-a-biztalk-services-experiment.aspx\">TweetieBot<\/a>. I agree 100% with his point about the assumption of centralization will be challenged by the federation of personal services. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Soma announcesPopFly, the &#8220;fun, easy way to build and share mashups, gadgets, Web pages, and applications&#8221; from the Non-Professional tools team.
