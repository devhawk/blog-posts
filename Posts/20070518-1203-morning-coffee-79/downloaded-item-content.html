<li>Soma <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/05/18/popfly.aspx">announces</a><a href="http://www.popfly.ms">PopFly</a>, the &#8220;fun, easy way to build and share mashups, gadgets, Web pages, and applications&#8221; from the <a href="http://www.popfly.ms/Overview/About.aspx">Non-Professional tools team</a>. The PopFly <a href="http://popflyteam.spaces.live.com">team blog</a> has <a href="http://popflyteam.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!51018025071FD37F!131.entry">some videos</a>. Sounds vaguely like <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipes</a>, but cooler. While most of the focus is on their <a href="http://www.popfly.ms/Overview/Default.aspx">browser-based mashup creator</a>, they also have <a href="http://www.popfly.ms/Overview/Explorer.aspx">VS support</a> for the non-non-professionals among us. </li>
<li>Eric Nelson <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericnel/archive/2007/05/16/microsoft-crm-microsoft-business-application-platform.aspx">suggests</a> that the new Dynamics CRM systems is actually a LOB application platform in it&#8217;s own right. More details in <a href="http://sessions.visitmix.com/default.asp?event=1011&session=2012&pid=DEV09&disc=&id=1518&year=2007&search=DEV09">Ben Riga&#8217;s MIX session</a>.

<li>Sam Gentile is <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/05/18/new-and-notable-167.aspx">worried</a> that C# is becoming to complex, especially when you also consider how fast the platform is moving underneath. When you get your head out of the debugger for a second and look at the Big Picture, it certainly seems overwhelming. Is it just a question of getting used to it? The first time I fired up the VS.net 2002 alpha and looked at all the classes in the BCL, I had the same overwhelmed feeling, but eventually I got over it. Or have things just gotten too big and move to fast now? If so, it&#8217;s time for some new layers of abstraction&#8230;</li>
<li>Udi Dahan <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/05/17/testing-services-the-hard-way-with-wcf/">writes</a> about building testable services. Testability has to be a core consideration when building anything, but especially a reusable framework. I&#8217;ve had similar thoughts about language design. How do you unit test a DSL? </li>
<li>Roberto Medrano of SOA Software <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/05/14/20FEsoabottle-1_1.html">thinks</a> &#8220;maybe 20 percent of IT folks understand SOA and half of the rest think they do&#8221;. Personally, I think most IT folks don&#8217;t agree on what SOA is or should be. Furthermore, we don&#8217;t even have a common lexicon to discuss it, so we end up talking past each other and arguing about topics we agree on. I think Roberto is really saying is &#8220;most people are wrong because they don&#8217;t agree with what&nbsp;I think SOA is&#8221;.

<li>Jeffrey Snover <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2007/05/18/the-virtuous-cycle-net-developers-using-to-powershell.aspx">talks</a> about the virtuous cycle of .NET language support. His point is that time spent learning .NET pays off as you transition between system programming&nbsp;(C#, VB.NET), shell programming (PowerShell) and script programming (IronPython, DLR). I&#8217;m not sure I would break them down that way, but his point spot on. </li>
<li>Clemens Vasters experiments with the new <a href="http://labs.biztalk.net/">BizTalk Services</a> with a sample called <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/clemensv/archive/2007/05/16/tweetiebot-a-biztalk-services-experiment.aspx">TweetieBot</a>. I agree 100% with his point about the assumption of centralization will be challenged by the federation of personal services. </li>
