<p>Thanks to <a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed">Werner</a> for <a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000430.html">linking</a> to the <a href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/">Flick Filosopher</a>. I liked the analysis of <a href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/flickfilos/archive/2004/jesuschrist.shtml">The Passion of the Christ</a> and the comparison Monty Python&#8217;s Life of Brian. I especially liked her <a href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/flickfilos/articles/bestdesign2003.shtml">Best &amp; Worst Of 2003</a> article as well. An you have <i>got</i> to respect anyone who has &#8220;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai: Across the Eighth Dimension&#8221; at the top of their list of <a href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/canon/index.shtml">100 comfort movies</a>. Only downer &#8211; no RSS feed. &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
<p>The other movie review site I read regularly is <a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/">Mr. Cranky</a>. I&#8217;m a big fan of his unique comments on bad movies such as &#8221; I have never come closer to tearing my own penis off and throwing it at the screen while watching a movie&#8221; (<a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/tombraider2.html">Laura Croft 2</a>) &#8220;Chris Klein is like Keanu Reeves without any talent&#8230;Frankly, I have a hard time even comprehending that sentence and its terrible implications.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/rollerball.html">Rollerball</a>) and &#8220;This film caused the kind of pain I&#8217;d normally associate with being shot through the thigh by a rusty nail from a high-powered nail gun&#8221; (<a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/savingsilverman.html">Saving Silverman</a>). Again, no RSS feed. &lt;double sigh&gt;</p>
