<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/">COmega</a> (otherwise known as Cw since most people don&#8217;t have an omega key on their keyboard) is on a long list of stuff for me to look at. But instead of actually coding with it, so far I can just read <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/default.aspx">Steve Maine&#8217;s blog</a>. He&#8217;s got interesting posts on <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,9f8394a0-50df-4f7d-8a24-af2a69257728.aspx">syncronization</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,24c0d2b7-59f3-4c68-8f16-6b58877b2541.aspx">streams</a>, the two big features of Cw over C# (come to think of it, we use the &#8220;#&#8221; symbol as most people don&#8217;t have an actual&nbsp;sharp key on their keyboard).&nbsp;I also learned from Steve that Cw comes with basic VS integration &#8211; you get project support, syntax highlighting and some Intellisense. Now I just need a few extra hours in the day.</p>
