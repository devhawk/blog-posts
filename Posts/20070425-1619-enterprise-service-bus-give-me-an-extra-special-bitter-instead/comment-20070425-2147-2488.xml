  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Harry,

The problems that you are attributing to ESB's are really those of the Broker style that BizTalk supports. That central hub you talk about is not a part of message exchanges in the Bus style, although many ESB's do have some sort of central location to jumpstart interactions.

This is the main problem I have with Microsoft's ESB message. BizTalk is a broker and will not be a bus until it is redesigned from the ground up. At least, that's what I think :)]]></wp:comment_content>
