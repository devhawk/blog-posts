<p>I went to a talk on BizTalk and ESB at lunch today that was sponsored by the <a href="http://www.nwconnectedsystems.org/">local connected systems user group</a>. Like many terms in this space (SOA and governance to name two others), ESB doesn&#8217;t seem to have a consistent definition. The industry seems to be inventing terms at a fair clip as vendors attempt to differentiate themselves on what to me seem like fairly minor solution aspects. </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s&nbsp;speaker talked at length about a &#8220;large health care company in California&#8221; that he had personally worked with, building an ESB for them with BizTalk. He spoke in glowing terms of the size of the BizTalk environment and the number of messages passing through the bus every day.&nbsp;Then someone asked how many systems this unnamed company had hooked up to the bus. He paused, then admitted: &#8220;Six&#8221;. </p>
<p>Six? Not six <em>whole </em>systems! That&#8217;s gotta be a record! </p>
<p>Of course, I realize that there are deployed ESB&#8217;s out there that are integrating more than six systems. My group &#8211; the Integration Center of Excellence (ICoE for short) &#8211; runs a comparably sized BizTalk environment and we&#8217;re connecting around 50 internal systems and hundreds of external partners. But 50 is still a fairly small number. I can&#8217;t help but wonder how well will this ESB approach is going scale as the number of systems goes up a couple orders of magnitude. Frankly, I think the answer is &#8220;not well&#8221;. </p>
<p>The problem I have with ESB is that it&#8217;s a centralized approach. Given that one of the overriding trends of society in general and IT in particular is decentralization, the ESB approach feels like it&#8217;s swimming against the current instead of with it. </p>
<p>As an analogy, consider how well would the Internet work if every connection went thru a central hub? See what I mean? Centralized systems don&#8217;t scale like decentralized ones do. </p>
<p>I admit that there are scenarios where ESB-esque technology solves a practical problem. Transport adaptation and content based routing leap to mind. Services that need those capabilities should leverage ESB-esque technology. But whenever I listen to ESB proponents, I feel that the need for these capabilities is exaggerated to the point that every message exchanged between every service inside your enterprise travels on&nbsp;a central bus, which doesn&#8217;t seem realistic to me.</p>
<p>Am I wrong about this characterization? Do ESB proponents think that all messages must travel on the bus? How about <em>you</em>? What do you think? Inquiring minds (aka me) want to know&#8230;</p>
