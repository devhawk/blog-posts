<p>Arguably, the biggest feature of C# 4.0 is the new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264736(VS.100).aspx">dynamic type</a>. And it&#8217;ll be great&#8230;when it ships. In the meantime, some of us what to build hybrid C# and IronPython applications today, such as my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/08/07/Pygments+For+Windows+Live+Writer+V102.aspx">Pygments for Windows Live Writer plugin</a>. </p>

With the exception of a couple of bugs in our importer (<a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/08/07/Pygments+For+Windows+Live+Writer+V102.aspx">discussed here</a>) it works great with IronPython. It&#8217;s also extensible, so I was able to easily build a custom formatter to output exactly the HTML I want inserted in my blog posts. So it made perfect sense to use Pygments as the basis of a Windows Live Writer plugin. </p>

If you want to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa702851.aspx">create a custom Content Source</a> for Windows Live Writer, you have to generate a compiled on-disk assembly with a static type and custom attributes. Not exactly IronPython&#8217;s forte, if you know what I mean. I did try and build a pure IronPython solution, but eventually gave up. So I ended up building a hybrid solution. The front end of the plugin as well as the UI elements are written in C# while the syntax highlighter engine is written in IronPython. And since this is running on the current .NET framework, I didn&#8217;t have the new fangled C# 4.0 dynamic type to help me. </p>
<p>Over the next couple of blog posts, I want to highlight a few aspects how I built this plugin, including compiling Python packages into assemblies and invoking Python code from C# 3.0 and earlier. If you want to look for your self, <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/pygments.wlwriter/tree/master">the source</a> is up on GitHub.</p>
