With the exception of a couple of bugs in our importer (<a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2009\/08\/07\/Pygments+For+Windows+Live+Writer+V102.aspx\">discussed here<\/a>) it works great with IronPython. It\u2019s also extensible, so I was able to easily build a custom formatter to output exactly the HTML I want inserted in my blog posts. So it made perfect sense to use Pygments as the basis of a Windows Live Writer plugin. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/WindowsLiveWriter\/CallingIronPythonfromCWithouttheDynamicT_E49B\/image_6.png\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1278\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" align=\"left\" src=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/WindowsLiveWriter\/CallingIronPythonfromCWithouttheDynamicT_E49B\/image_thumb_2.png\" width=\"122\" height=\"220\" \/><\/a> As great a tool as Windows Live Writer is, it\u2019s developers haven\u2019t exactly seen the light when it comes to dynamic languages. If you want to <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/aa702851.aspx\">create a custom Content Source<\/a> for Windows Live Writer, you have to generate a compiled on-disk assembly with a static type and custom attributes. Not exactly IronPython\u2019s forte, if you know what I mean. I did try and build a pure IronPython solution, but eventually gave up. So I ended up building a hybrid solution. The front end of the plugin as well as the UI elements are written in C# while the syntax highlighter engine is written in IronPython. And since this is running on the current .NET framework, I didn\u2019t have the new fangled C# 4.0 dynamic type to help me. <\/p>\n<p>Over the next couple of blog posts, I want to highlight a few aspects how I built this plugin, including compiling Python packages into assemblies and invoking Python code from C# 3.0 and earlier.
