<p>Cool thing about blogs - sometimes I learn about stuff happening inside the big house from outside in blogs. Case in point - <a href="http://scottwater.com/Blog/">Scott</a><a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2004/07/22/12704.aspx">pointed out</a> to the <a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/download.html">Lookout download</a>. I also found out about the <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/Comega/">COmega site</a> from <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/">Don</a> (though honestly, I knew about that one before. That is before it changed names.)</p><p><em>Update</em> - Lookout's <a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/download.html">download site</a> changed, back to a page on http://lookoutsoft.com instead of a page on http://download.microsoft.com. Strange, but true.</p>
