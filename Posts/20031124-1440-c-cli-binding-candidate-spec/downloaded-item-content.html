<p>I <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=a6428efe-595e-479a-a3df-3897d6679977">blogged</a> on the new ECMA working group for <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/news/ecma-TG5-PR.htm">standardizing the C++ binding for CLI</a> last month. Last week, <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/hsutter/">Herb Sutter</a><a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/hsutter/permalink.aspx/44e3520b-b8ca-4961-8930-59346e721a9b">blogged</a> the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/9/c/99c65bcd-ac66-482e-8dc1-0e14cd1670cd/C++%20CLI%20Candidate%20Base%20Draft.pdf">candidate specification</a>. And to answer the question I posed, it does appear that the double underscore syntax has been removed. Instead of &#8220;__gc class {&#8230;}&#8221;, it&#8217;s just &#8220;ref class&#8221;. For __value and __property, you just lose the double underscore. Cool, though it does mean any MC++ code will eventually need to be migrated to the new syntax. Also. the specification is forward looking, including support for CLI generics. </p>
<p>Herb also blogged in depth on the <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/hsutter/permalink.aspx/9a9b7f1a-652e-4f18-b431-bfea2fd554d7">new keywords</a> as well as the <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/hsutter/permalink.aspx/bc7a98db-6b1f-40d3-b9ce-14b3708c400d">gcnew operator</a>.</p>
