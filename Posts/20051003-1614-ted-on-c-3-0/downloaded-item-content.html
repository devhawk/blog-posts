<p>I just discovered <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward&#8217;s&nbsp;blog</a> has moved. In catching up, I found this <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2005/09/22/Language+Innovation+C+30+Explained.aspx">great post</a> on the new features of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/future/">C# 3.0</a>. Even though I had read thru the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/0/9503e33e-fde6-4aed-b5d0-ffe749822f1b/csharp%203.0%20specification.doc">C# 3.0 spec</a>, Ted&#8217;s explanation was much easier to read. </p>
<p>FYI, speaking of Ted, I&#8217;ll be speaking at his <a href="http://nofluffjuststuff.net/">No Fluff Just Stuff .NET software symposium</a>. Still working w/ Ted on the abstracts, but basically I&#8217;m basically talking about <a href="http://patternshare.org/">patterns</a>, <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/gat/default.aspx">GAT</a> and <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/DSLTools/default.aspx">DSLs</a>.</p>
