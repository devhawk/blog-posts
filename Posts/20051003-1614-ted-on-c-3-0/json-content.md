I just discovered [Ted Neward’s blog](http://blogs.tedneward.com/) has
moved. In catching up, I found this [great
post](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2005/09/22/Language+Innovation+C+30+Explained.aspx)
on the new features of [C\#
3.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/future/). Even though I had read
thru the [C\# 3.0
spec](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/0/9503e33e-fde6-4aed-b5d0-ffe749822f1b/csharp%203.0%20specification.doc),
Ted’s explanation was much easier to read.

FYI, speaking of Ted, I’ll be speaking at his [No Fluff Just Stuff .NET
software symposium](http://nofluffjuststuff.net/). Still working w/ Ted
on the abstracts, but basically I’m basically talking about
[patterns](http://patternshare.org/),
[GAT](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/gat/default.aspx)
and
[DSLs](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/DSLTools/default.aspx).
