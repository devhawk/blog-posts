I’m back from my two week vacation (note to self: two weeks is about
three days too long for a three and one year old to be away from home).
But here isn’t where I left it. While I was gone, my team moved into a
new temporary space. On the plus side, I have an office instead of a
cube, the team is all together and this area of the building is pretty
deserted, so it’s quiet. On the downside, I’m sharing the office with
the program manager for my project and as I said, it’s temporary. I
guess there’s no point unpacking.

**Update**: about 30 minutes after I posted this, we got the official email
that we’re moving at the end of the month.
