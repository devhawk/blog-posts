<p>I&#8217;m back from my two week vacation (note to self: two weeks is about three days too long for a three and one year old to be away from home). But here isn&#8217;t where I left it. While I was gone, my team moved into a new temporary space. On the plus side, I have an office instead of a cube, the team is all together and this area of the building is pretty deserted, so it&#8217;s quiet. On the downside, I&#8217;m sharing the office with the program manager for my project and as I said, it&#8217;s temporary. I guess there&#8217;s no point unpacking. </p>
<p>Update &#8211; about 30 minutes after I posted this, we got the official email that we&#8217;re moving at the end of the month.</p>
