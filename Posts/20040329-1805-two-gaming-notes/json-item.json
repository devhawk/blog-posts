You can check out the videos to see some idea of the capabilities, but trust me they&#8217;re pretty impressive (of course, they are pre-rendered &#8211; I wanna see them render in real-time on my machine). In addition to the graphics capabilities, they&#8217;re bringing Xbox Live to Windows. And the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/xna\/faq.aspx\">FAQ<\/a> implies that the XNA will be part of the DirectX SDK &amp; Xbox XDK, meaning that there won&#8217;t be any additional cost for it. I wonder how this toolkit will impact the non-industry programmer. i.e. can <i>I <\/i>use it to make 3D games?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve blogged before about my interest in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.machinima.com\/\">machinima<\/a> &#8211; which is frankly why I&#8217;m interested in XNA. Now, Lionhead studios and Activision is coming out with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themoviesgame.com\/home.html\">The Movies<\/a>, a simulation game where you get to manage a movie studio. What&#8217;s cool is that you can actually <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themoviesgame.com\/make.html\">make little movies<\/a> (according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lhtimes.com\/themoviesfaq.html\">FAQ<\/a>, average length is between 30 seconds and three minutes, but you can make full-length movies if you have the patience) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themoviesgame.com\/screenshot_horror1.html\">Horror movies<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themoviesgame.com\/screenshot_western2.html\">westerns<\/a> have screenshots, but you can make sci-fi, action, comedy, romance, thriller and romance movies as well. I don&#8217;t get much game time these days (I&#8217;ve gone back to work my way thru the original Splinter Cell before buying Pandora Tomorrow) but I know this is one I&#8217;ll get as soon as it comes out.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m way behind on blog reading as well as writing, so maybe other have covered these, but I feel compelled to mention them anyway.
