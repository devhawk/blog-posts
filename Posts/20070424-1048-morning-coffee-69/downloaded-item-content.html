<li>John Shewchuk <a href="http://connectedsystems.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!10E0A1CD60CAE1A9!248.entry">introduces</a> the new <a href="http://labs.biztalk.net/">BizTalk Services</a>. Well, &#8220;new&#8221; is a bit of a misnomer: STS and Relay (now called <a href="https://identity.biztalk.net/">Identity</a> and <a href="http://connect.biztalk.net/">Connectivity</a>) were previously available under the <a href="http://labs.live.com/">Live Labs</a> umbrella and the other new services they announced aren&#8217;t available yet. Bt these new services they announced are compelling: <a href="http://servicebus.biztalk.net/">ServiceBus</a> is an pub/sub event delivery mechanism that scales to the internet and <a href="http://workflow.biztalk.net/">Workflow</a> is a WF hosting solution. I&#8217;m looking forward to experimenting with these new services (when they become available). </li>
<li>Nick Malik <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/04/22/redefining-soa-governance.aspx">continues his series</a> of posts on governance. Money quote: &#8220;Tools manage, People govern&#8221;. I feel a little bad because I punted on the governance presentation that&#8217;s he&#8217;s preping, so maybe I&#8217;ll get that on a <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/product/128254336003627152">bumper sticker</a>&nbsp;for him or something. </li>
<li>Chris Anderson has a <a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2007/04/im_in_halo_3.html">few voice-over lines</a> in Halo 3. While that&#8217;s cool for him, he mentions a new feature I was unaware of: &#8220;the one thing that completely blew me away (aside from the graphics, animation, level design and new vehicles and weapons) was the ability to record a game and play it back on Xbox Live, freezing the action at any point and flying around the scene, Matrix style. It may sound just like a standard replay function, but take my word for it, it&#8217;s not. I think it&#8217;s revolutionary, and I predict that Halo 3 will take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima">machinima</a> to a whole new level.&#8221; Cool! </li>
