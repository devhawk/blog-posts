    [introduces](http://connectedsystems.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!10E0A1CD60CAE1A9!248.entry)
    the new [BizTalk Services](http://labs.biztalk.net/). Well, “new” is
    a bit of a misnomer: STS and Relay (now called
    [Identity](https://identity.biztalk.net/) and
    [Connectivity](http://connect.biztalk.net/)) were previously
    available under the [Live Labs](http://labs.live.com/) umbrella and
    the other new services they announced aren’t available yet. Bt these
    new services they announced are compelling:
    [ServiceBus](http://servicebus.biztalk.net/) is an pub/sub event
    delivery mechanism that scales to the internet and
    [Workflow](http://workflow.biztalk.net/) is a WF hosting solution.
    I’m looking forward to experimenting with these new services (when
    they become available).

    I feel a little bad because I punted on the governance presentation
    that’s he’s preping, so maybe I’ll get that on a [bumper
    sticker](http://www.zazzle.com/product/128254336003627152) for him
    or something.

    lines](http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2007/04/im_in_halo_3.html)
    in Halo 3. While that’s cool for him, he mentions a new feature I
    was unaware of: “the one thing that completely blew me away (aside
    from the graphics, animation, level design and new vehicles and
    weapons) was the ability to record a game and play it back on Xbox
    Live, freezing the action at any point and flying around the scene,
    Matrix style. It may sound just like a standard replay function, but
    take my word for it, it’s not. I think it’s revolutionary, and I
    predict that Halo 3 will take
    [machinima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima) to a whole new
    level.” Cool!
