<p>I just picked up a 40GB <a href="http://www.nomadworld.com/products/Jukebox_ZenXtra/">Nomad Zen Xtra</a>. I know everyone is all ga-ga for the iPod, but I have all my media in WMA I found the Nomad for almost half the price of a 40GB iPod. I also picked up <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/">Notmad Explorer</a> which is <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/ctable.php">much cooler</a> than the built in software. I especially like the Xtreamer capability which allows you to play music stored on the Nomad thru your computer speakers. So far, I&#8217;ve only filled up 1/3 of the storage &#8211; I guess I need to rip more of my CD collection!</p>
