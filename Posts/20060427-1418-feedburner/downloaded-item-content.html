<p>I finally got around to signing up for a FeedBurner feed for DevHawk today. It&#8217;s available <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Devhawk">here</a>. I&#8217;ve updated my site template, but existing readers are still getting the old feed. Scott has <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SyndicatingComputerZen.aspx">built support</a> for FeedBurner into dasBlog, but it isn&#8217;t released yet. Feel free to switch over on your own if you want, but I&#8217;ll get the automatic redirection working soon enough.</p>
<p>UPDATE &#8211; Apparently I didn&#8217;t look hard enough. FeedBurner support made it into the currently shipping version of dasBlog, so I&#8217;ve turned it on. Thanks to <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/">Tomas Restrepo</a> for the <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,04960B18-350D-42C8-939A-E36C908B8CC4.aspx#11a60941-d728-480e-89f1-45620788ccd7">heads up</a>.</p>
