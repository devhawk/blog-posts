<p>I finally got around to signing up for a FeedBurner feed for DevHawk today. It's available <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Devhawk">here</a>. I've updated my site template, but existing readers are still getting the old feed. Scott has <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SyndicatingComputerZen.aspx">built support</a> for FeedBurner into dasBlog, but it isn't released yet. Feel free to switch over on your own if you want, but I'll get the automatic redirection working soon enough.</p><p>UPDATE - Apparently I didn't look hard enough. FeedBurner support made it into the currently shipping version of dasBlog, so I've turned it on. Thanks to <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/">Tomas Restrepo</a> for the <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,04960B18-350D-42C8-939A-E36C908B8CC4.aspx#11a60941-d728-480e-89f1-45620788ccd7">heads up</a>.</p>
