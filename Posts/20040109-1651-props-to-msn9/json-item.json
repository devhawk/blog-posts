I used to use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/oe\/\">Outlook Express<\/a> but the lack of junk mail filtering doomed that choice (I know about tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/popfile.sourceforge.net\/\">POPFile<\/a>, but I wanted a single app solution). I also tried <a href=\"http:\/\/office.microsoft.com\/home\/office.aspx?assetid=FX01085793\">Outlook 2003<\/a> which had good junk mail filtering but it was bad at keeping my email accounts seperate. The <a href=\"http:\/\/join.msn.com\/?pgmarket=en-us&amp;page=byoa\/plus\">MSN Plus<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/join.msn.com\/?pgmarket=en-us&amp;page=byoa\/prem\">MSN Premium<\/a> both support accessing POP3 email address, keep the email seperate from my personal hotmail email and do a great job filtering junk.
