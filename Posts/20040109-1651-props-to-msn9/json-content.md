A bunch of people have already blogged the new
[MSN](http://www.msn.com/). I mean, it did launch yesterday. (I feel so
behind the times).

However, I have to blog on my favorite new feature â€“ [integrated POP3
email](http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=features/richmail). I
started using [Thunderbird](http://mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/)
because I wanted to keep my [DevHawk email](mailto:harry@devhawk.net)
seperate from my [work](mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com) and personal
email addresses. I used to use [Outlook
Express](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/oe/) but the lack of junk mail
filtering doomed that choice (I know about tools like
[POPFile](http://popfile.sourceforge.net/), but I wanted a single app
solution). I also tried [Outlook
2003](http://office.microsoft.com/home/office.aspx?assetid=FX01085793)
which had good junk mail filtering but it was bad at keeping my email
accounts seperate. The [MSN
Plus](http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=byoa/plus) and [MSN
Premium](http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=byoa/prem) both
support accessing POP3 email address, keep the email seperate from my
personal hotmail email and do a great job filtering junk. Cool!
