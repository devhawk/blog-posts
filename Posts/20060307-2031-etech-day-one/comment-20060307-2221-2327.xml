I will admit a certain degree of disappointment in ETECH. It feels like a conference that is more impressed with itself than actually illuminating ideas for the attendees. The overall staging is pretty poor as well. Not free-for-all as an unconference but not nearly at the standards I would expect for the amount of money paid.]]></wp:comment_content>
