<p>I&#8217;ve been using SharpReader all day &#8211; like everyone else. I love it, but I do have a couple of feature requests. I love the folder view &#8211; click on &#8220;subscribed feeds&#8221; and it shows every entry in every blog you&#8217;re subscribed to. However, since not everyone uses the same format for dates, the &#8220;sort by date&#8221; feature doesn&#8217;t always bring the unread entries to the top. Can we get a &#8220;only show unread&#8221; filter? And I&#8217;d like a simple method to skip to the next unread entry (Syndirella uses the space bar for this). </p>
<p>I see <a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/">Luke</a> has <a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/07.html#000057">resurfaced</a> after going dark for 24 hours straight. I wonder if he was handling feature requests?</p>
