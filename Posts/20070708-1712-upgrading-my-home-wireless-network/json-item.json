I got a bunch of responses, both for and against PowerLine. I ended up upgrading my wireless network because 1) I was having laptop connectivity issues and 2) wireless equipment is so fraking cheap. I might still go PowerLine later, though I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s &#8220;good enough&#8221; until I really bite the bullet and run Cat5 under my house. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday, I picked up a couple of Buffalo\u00a0Wireless routers:\u00a0a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buffalotech.com\/products\/wireless\/wireless-g-mimo-performance\/wireless-g-mimo-performance-broadband-router-and-access-point-with-high-gain-antenna\">WHR-HP-G54<\/a> and a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buffalotech.com\/products\/wireless\/wireless-g-125-high-speed\/wireless-g-high-speed-router\/\">WHR-G125<\/a>. The first one has a high-powered antenna, so I hoped that would solve my range problem. Both support <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wireless_Distribution_System\">Wireless Distribution System<\/a> (aka WDS), so the plan was to use the WHR-G125 as a repeater and\/or bridge. Also, both support 3rd party firmware, a la <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dd-wrt.com\">DD-WRT<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/openwrt.org\/\">OpenWrt<\/a>. In fact, I chose these models specifically because they&#8217;re listed on DD-WRT&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dd-wrt.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Supported_Devices\">Supported Devices page<\/a> as best range and cheapest, respectively. Best Buy had them both on sale, so together they cost around $90 and I didn&#8217;t even have to wait for them to be shipped.<\/p>\n<p>I also moved my cable modem from the loft to the living room. That way, the Xbox 360 &#8211; with all the large demo and video downloads &#8211; gets the best bandwidth, typically around 8Mbit (though SpeedTest.net has clocked my connection as high as 18Mbit). <\/p>\n<p>Moving the cable modem meant putting my loft desktop machine on the wireless network. At first, I used the G125 as a bridge. Getting it setup as a bridge using WDS was fairly straightforward, except that these routers only support <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy\">WEP<\/a> in that configuration and WEP <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/RC4_%28cipher%29#Fluhrer.2C_Mantin_and_Shamir_attack\">is essentially broken<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>At this point, I figured I had to either live with WEP (*BUZZ* wrong answer) or upgrade both routers with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dd-wrt.com\">DD-WRT firmware<\/a>. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dd-wrt.com\/wiki\/index.php\/WDS\">their wiki<\/a>, DD-WRT firmware supports <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access\">WPA<\/a> for WDS. Then I remembered a third option, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/FlashingTheFirmwareOfAnXboxMN740WirelessAdapterToADLink108AGToSupportWPASecurity.aspx\">detailed<\/a> by Scott Hanselman a few weeks back. I had been using an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/live\/connect\/msmn740.htm\">Xbox MN-740 wireless bridge<\/a> to get my Xbox 360 on the wireless network. However, since my Xbox is hardwired now, I didn&#8217;t need it anymore. Scott&#8217;s posted about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dslreports.com\/forum\/remark,13360873\">flashing the MN-740<\/a> with the firmware from the <a href=\"http:\/\/games.dlink.com\/products\/?pid=383\">D-Link 108AG gaming adapter<\/a>\u00a0(they&#8217;re the same hardware under the hood) that supports WPA. It took several tries before it worked, but eventually I was able to flash the device.<\/p>\n<p>So now I am using the WHR-HP-G54 as my main router and access point in the living room and the flashed MN-740 to put my loft desktop machine on the wireless WPA-secured network. That desktop has all my media and is running <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/products\/windowsvista\/editions\/ultimate\/default.mspx\">Vista Ultimate<\/a>, so I was able to get both <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/media\/xbox360media.htm\">media sharing<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/hardware\/windowsmediacenter.htm\">Media Center Extender<\/a>\u00a0working. According to the network diagnostics on Vista, the connection is fast enough to stream SD video, but not HD. So I figure I&#8217;ll still need to run some Cat5. But for now, I&#8217;m not trying to stream HD video from the machine in the loft so I figure I can wait on the Cat5.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, I have the G125 to experiment with. For $35, it was cheap enough that I can upgrade it with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dd-wrt.com\/dd-wrtv2\/down.php?path=downloads%2Fbeta%2FBUFFALO+WHR-G125\/\">latest DD-WRT firmware<\/a> without worrying about losing my &#8220;investment&#8221; if I brick the thing. If I get it upgraded and working, I&#8217;ll do the HP-G54 too, and be able to use the G125 as a repeater and\/or bridge. Maybe that will make the network fast enough to stream HD video, but I doubt it.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to those who offered me their advice. Any of you want to come over and help run a little Cat5 under my house, beer &amp; BBQ is on me!<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>A few weeks ago, I put out the call for advice on improving my home network.
