<p>A few weeks ago, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/06/23/Home+Networking+Question.aspx">put out the call for advice</a> on improving my home network. I got a bunch of responses, both for and against PowerLine. I ended up upgrading my wireless network because 1) I was having laptop connectivity issues and 2) wireless equipment is so fraking cheap. I might still go PowerLine later, though I'm thinking it's "good enough" until I really bite the bullet and run Cat5 under my house.  </p><p>Yesterday, I picked up a couple of Buffalo Wireless routers: a <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/products/wireless/wireless-g-mimo-performance/wireless-g-mimo-performance-broadband-router-and-access-point-with-high-gain-antenna">WHR-HP-G54</a> and a <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/products/wireless/wireless-g-125-high-speed/wireless-g-high-speed-router/">WHR-G125</a>. The first one has a high-powered antenna, so I hoped that would solve my range problem. Both support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Distribution_System">Wireless Distribution System</a> (aka WDS), so the plan was to use the WHR-G125 as a repeater and/or bridge. Also, both support 3rd party firmware, a la <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com">DD-WRT</a> and <a href="http://openwrt.org/">OpenWrt</a>. In fact, I chose these models specifically because they're listed on DD-WRT's <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices">Supported Devices page</a> as best range and cheapest, respectively. Best Buy had them both on sale, so together they cost around $90 and I didn't even have to wait for them to be shipped.</p><p>I also moved my cable modem from the loft to the living room. That way, the Xbox 360 - with all the large demo and video downloads - gets the best bandwidth, typically around 8Mbit (though SpeedTest.net has clocked my connection as high as 18Mbit). </p><p>Moving the cable modem meant putting my loft desktop machine on the wireless network. At first, I used the G125 as a bridge. Getting it setup as a bridge using WDS was fairly straightforward, except that these routers only support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">WEP</a> in that configuration and WEP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4_%28cipher%29#Fluhrer.2C_Mantin_and_Shamir_attack">is essentially broken</a>. </p><p>At this point, I figured I had to either live with WEP (*BUZZ* wrong answer) or upgrade both routers with <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com">DD-WRT firmware</a>. According to <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/WDS">their wiki</a>, DD-WRT firmware supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access">WPA</a> for WDS. Then I remembered a third option, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FlashingTheFirmwareOfAnXboxMN740WirelessAdapterToADLink108AGToSupportWPASecurity.aspx">detailed</a> by Scott Hanselman a few weeks back. I had been using an <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/connect/msmn740.htm">Xbox MN-740 wireless bridge</a> to get my Xbox 360 on the wireless network. However, since my Xbox is hardwired now, I didn't need it anymore. Scott's posted about <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,13360873">flashing the MN-740</a> with the firmware from the <a href="http://games.dlink.com/products/?pid=383">D-Link 108AG gaming adapter</a> (they're the same hardware under the hood) that supports WPA. It took several tries before it worked, but eventually I was able to flash the device.</p><p>So now I am using the WHR-HP-G54 as my main router and access point in the living room and the flashed MN-740 to put my loft desktop machine on the wireless WPA-secured network. That desktop has all my media and is running <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/ultimate/default.mspx">Vista Ultimate</a>, so I was able to get both <a href="http://www.xbox.com/media/xbox360media.htm">media sharing</a> and the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/hardware/windowsmediacenter.htm">Media Center Extender</a> working. According to the network diagnostics on Vista, the connection is fast enough to stream SD video, but not HD. So I figure I'll still need to run some Cat5. But for now, I'm not trying to stream HD video from the machine in the loft so I figure I can wait on the Cat5.</p><p>Plus, I have the G125 to experiment with. For $35, it was cheap enough that I can upgrade it with the <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/down.php?path=downloads%2Fbeta%2FBUFFALO+WHR-G125/">latest DD-WRT firmware</a> without worrying about losing my "investment" if I brick the thing. If I get it upgraded and working, I'll do the HP-G54 too, and be able to use the G125 as a repeater and/or bridge. Maybe that will make the network fast enough to stream HD video, but I doubt it.</p><p>Thanks to those who offered me their advice. Any of you want to come over and help run a little Cat5 under my house, beer &amp; BBQ is on me!</p>
