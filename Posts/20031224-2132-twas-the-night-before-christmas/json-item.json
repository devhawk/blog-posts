Of course, I read him <a href=\"http:\/\/www.night.net\/christmas\/twas-the-night.html\">&#8216;Twas the Night Before Christmas<\/a> before bedtime. He was pretty worked up because we have quite a crowd in town. My parents, brother and great aunt all arrived today. That makes eight with my wife, my son, my mother-in-law (who just moved up a few months ago) and me. Add the tree and all the presents and you get a very excited little boy. Plus we&#8217;re going to Victoria to see my uncles the day after Christmas. <\/p>\n<p>With so many people in town plus it being my son&#8217;s first Christmas, we have a ton of presents under the tree. My wife&#8217;s immediate thought was of the kids all over the world who don&#8217;t get the presents (or the opportunities) that we do. It&#8217;s been an amazing year for me, from the birth of my son to my new job and getting published.\u00a0 I can only hope I am lucky enough to have as good year next year as I had this past year. In addition to the usual resolutions to clean out the garage and lose weight (though I have a <a href=\"http:\/\/technovangelist.com\/blogs\/default.aspx?date=12\/05\/03\">role model<\/a> on that one), I want to do more in 2004 to share this happiness and prosperity with those less fortunate. <\/p>\n<p>Have a happy holiday season and good luck to you, dear reader, for the year ahead.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>My son (pictured with Santa) finally fell asleep for his first Christmas Eve.
