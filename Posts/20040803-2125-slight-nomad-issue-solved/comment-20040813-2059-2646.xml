  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I just got a 30gb zen about a month ago as well. I've been loving the hell out of it.. the only beef I had was the inability to use it as an external hard drive. Notmad is a must have for any zen user IMO, the web streamer and winamp media library plugin that come with it are worth the $25 alone.

Have you ever tried hooking up your zen to your car stereo? I currently use a headphone->tape adapter that works ok, but the  stereo sound seems to come in kinda weak on the back channel. I've also tried streaming the mp3 player over a local FM transmiiter (ala iRock!) and experienced extremely muffled audio. I'm thinking about replacing my in-dash unit with a receiver that takes a line input for better quality. Any suggestions?]]></wp:comment_content>
