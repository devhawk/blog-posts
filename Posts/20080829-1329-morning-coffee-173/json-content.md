I’m on my way out the door for New Zealand and Australia, but I wanted
to push out a few things.

-   F\# ~~August~~ September CTP is out! Don Syme has the
    [announcement](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/08/29/the-f-september-2008-ctp-is-now-available.aspx),
    Jomo Fisher has the [link
    roundup](http://blogs.msdn.com/jomo_fisher/pages/f-1-9-6-0-link-roundup.aspx)
    and details are on the brand-spanking-new MSDN F\# Dev Center. Major
    congrats to the F\# team. I’ve been running a pre-release version of
    these bits, and they are a huge step forward if you’re an F\#
    developer.
-   I’ve got an [article on
    IronPython](http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0809071)
    in the latest issue of CoDe magazine. Also check out [Brad
    Wilson’s](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/)[IronRuby
    article](http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0809061),
    [Ted Neward’s](http://blogs.tedneward.com/)[F\#
    article](http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0809051)
    and [Neil Ford’s](http://memeagora.blogspot.com/)[Polygot
    Programming
    article](http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0809041).
-   Via Michael Foord I discovered that IronPython tester Dave Fugate is
    [back on the blog](http://knowbody.livejournal.com/). He starts with
    a [couple](http://knowbody.livejournal.com/6191.html) of
    [posts](http://knowbody.livejournal.com/6442.html) about measuring
    IronPython performance.
-   Speaking of blogging teammates, I think the dynamic languages team
    has the highest percentage of bloggers in any group at MSFT. All
    four Program Managers ([Dave](http://blog.remlog.net/) (lead),
    [John](http://www.iunknown.com/),
    [Jimmy](http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/) and
    [me](http://devhawk.net/)), four of five developers
    ([Shri](http://blogs.msdn.com/shrib) (lead),
    [Dino](http://blogs.msdn.com/dinoviehland),
    [Curt](http://blogs.msdn.com/curth) and
    [Oleg](http://www.tkachenko.com/blog/)) and all three Testers
    ([Jim](http://blog.jredville.com/),
    [Dave](http://knowbody.livejournal.com/) and
    [Srivatsn](http://blogs.msdn.com/srivatsn/default.aspx)). The only
    non blogger right now is Tomas – who at least has a [home
    page](http://tmd.havit.cz/) – and  the lead tester which is an open
    position right now. 11 bloggers out of 12 team members equals 91.67%
    team blogger coverage.
-   I was really impressed with Newspeak when I [saw it at
    Lang.NET](http://www.langnetsymposium.com/talks/2-01%20-%20Newspeak%20-%20Gilad%20Braha%20-%20Cadence.html)
    so I’m very excited to see they have a [new
    website](http://newspeaklanguage.org/). No public bits yet, but I
    like the part where they point out Newspeak “can be implemented
    independently of Squeak, Smalltalk or any particular VM or IDE”. How
    about implementing a version on DLR guys?
-   Maurice de Beijer [shows
    off](http://msmvps.com/blogs/theproblemsolver/archive/2008/08/25/using-an-ironpython-runtime-service-from-windows-workflow-foundation.aspx)
    embedding IronPython inside a WF application. Kinda cool, but he’s
    primarily showing off implementing a CLR interface in IPy. How about
    a WF activity that execute arbitrary IPy code. That would be cool.

    URLs](http://ironpython-urls.blogspot.com/2008/08/ironpython-and-windows-workflow.html))
-   [Ironclad](http://code.google.com/p/ironclad/) has
    [reached](http://groups.google.com/group/ironpy/browse_frm/thread/4baf2673c0f0afcf/6e5d15c5d01de5e)
    their 0.5 milestone, being able to import numpy from IronPython.
    BTW, guys – I’m not sure commenting out one line that appears to be
    unreferenced qualifies as a “monstrous caveat”. Congrats guys! (via
    [IronPython
