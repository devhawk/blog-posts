Also check out <a href=\"http:\/\/bradwilson.typepad.com\/\">Brad Wilson&#8217;s<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.code-magazine.com\/Article.aspx?quickid=0809061\">IronRuby article<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/\">Ted Neward&#8217;s<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.code-magazine.com\/Article.aspx?quickid=0809051\">F# article<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/memeagora.blogspot.com\/\">Neil Ford&#8217;s<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.code-magazine.com\/Article.aspx?quickid=0809041\">Polygot Programming article<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Via Michael Foord I discovered that IronPython tester Dave Fugate is <a href=\"http:\/\/knowbody.livejournal.com\/\">back on the blog<\/a>. He starts with a <a href=\"http:\/\/knowbody.livejournal.com\/6191.html\">couple<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/knowbody.livejournal.com\/6442.html\">posts<\/a> about measuring IronPython performance.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of blogging teammates, I think the dynamic languages team has the highest percentage of bloggers in any group at MSFT. All four Program Managers (<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.remlog.net\/\">Dave<\/a> (lead), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iunknown.com\/\">John<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.jimmy.schementi.com\/\">Jimmy<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/\">me<\/a>), four of five developers (<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/shrib\">Shri<\/a> (lead), <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dinoviehland\">Dino<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/curth\">Curt<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tkachenko.com\/blog\/\">Oleg<\/a>) and all three Testers (<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.jredville.com\/\">Jim<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/knowbody.livejournal.com\/\">Dave<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/srivatsn\/default.aspx\">Srivatsn<\/a>). The only non blogger right now is Tomas &#8211; who at least has a <a href=\"http:\/\/tmd.havit.cz\/\">home page<\/a> &#8211; and\u00a0 the lead tester which is an open position right now. 11 bloggers out of 12 team members equals 91.67% team blogger coverage.  <\/li>\n<li>I was really impressed with Newspeak when I <a href=\"http:\/\/www.langnetsymposium.com\/talks\/2-01%20-%20Newspeak%20-%20Gilad%20Braha%20-%20Cadence.html\">saw it at Lang.NET<\/a> so I&#8217;m very excited to see they have a <a href=\"http:\/\/newspeaklanguage.org\/\">new website<\/a>. No public bits yet, but I like the part where they point out Newspeak &#8220;can be implemented independently of Squeak, Smalltalk or any particular VM or IDE&#8221;. How about implementing a version on DLR guys?  <\/li>\n<li>Maurice de Beijer <a href=\"http:\/\/msmvps.com\/blogs\/theproblemsolver\/archive\/2008\/08\/25\/using-an-ironpython-runtime-service-from-windows-workflow-foundation.aspx\">shows off<\/a> embedding IronPython inside a WF application. Kinda cool, but he&#8217;s primarily showing off implementing a CLR interface in IPy. How about a WF activity that execute arbitrary IPy code. That would be cool.

BTW, guys &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure commenting out one line that appears to be unreferenced qualifies as a &#8220;monstrous caveat&#8221;. Congrats guys!
