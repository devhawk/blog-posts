<p><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px" align="right" src="http://microsoftpdc.com/Images/BlogBling/PDC2008Brain.gif">So it&#8217;s been just over a month since my last post, and I think it&#8217;s safe to say it&#8217;s been one of the busiest of my career to date. If you&#8217;ve been following my <a href="http://twitter.com/devhawk">Twitter stream</a>, you already know that I&#8217;ve spent the last two weeks in <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/">PDC</a> dry runs &#8211; we went thru almost every session in the track, reviewing content and giving feedback to the speakers. Some were very good (as I <a href="http://twitter.com/DevHawk/statuses/948784175">twittered at the time</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/edpinto/">Ed Pinto&#8217;s</a><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL06/">Building WCF Services with WF</a> blew my mind). Others, needed more work, but I think will be great by PDC. I got into several disagreements about the best way to present content, had to raise my voice once, and called some speakers &#8220;a little creepy&#8221;. (No, I&#8217;m not telling you which sessions those were.)</p>
<p>After 9 days of dry runs, I spent Friday with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonz/">Jason Zander</a>, General Manager for Visual Studio, again reviewing almost all the decks with him and some marketing folks. Frankly, spending that much time with my boss&#8217;s boss&#8217;s boss&#8217;s boss is a bit intimidating, but Jason&#8217;s been great and I&#8217;m guessing the visibility will be great for my career. I mean, come review time, he won&#8217;t be saying &#8220;Harry who?&#8221; I&#8217;ve also gotten to meet people from far and wide across my division, which has been great since I&#8217;m still new over here.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp; I can&#8217;t talk much about <em>what</em> I&#8217;ve seen, since as you know most of it is new and being revealed at PDC for the first time publicly. For example, I can tell you Ed&#8217;s talk was frakking awesome, but I can&#8217;t tell you <em>why</em> I think it&#8217;s frakking awesome, yet. But I&#8217;m queuing up some posts now that I will publish later once the sessions are public. </p>
<p>Tomorrow, I&#8217;m back to my &#8220;day job&#8221; as the IronPython PM. My teammates have been soldering on in my absence &#8211; the one time I was in my office in the past two weeks I joked that no one would recognize me since I&#8217;ve been gone so long. We&#8217;re coming up on the final release of IronPython 2.0, and my exclusive focus on PDC has left me a mountain of work to do here in the final stretch. </p>
<p>In addition to my teammates, I need to give a quick shout out to <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/WM_IN/Developers-are-my-life-I-love-them-OK-how-can-you-not-want-to-find-out-more-about-who-said-tha">Shoshanna Budzianowski</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson">Mike Swanson</a>, without whom I&#8217;m not sure I would have survived the past two weeks. Mike is the PDC content owner, so as hard as the past two weeks have been for me, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re worse for him. Shoshanna is the track owner for the &#8220;Tools and Languages&#8221; track (that&#8217;s what the TL in the session codes stands for) and I&#8217;ve been the main representative for the VS group in the track. I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;s ever done something like PDC before, but she&#8217;s awesome.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I leave Friday for southern California. I&#8217;m going down early to see a few friends and to do my <a href="http://www.socalcodecamp.com/session.aspx?sid=96fe471e-e96d-4c82-bfa4-a2f7d4d88387">Pumping Iron talk</a> at the <a href="http://www.socalcodecamp.com/">SoCal Code Camp</a> next Saturday. That should be fun since it&#8217;s being held at <a href="http://viterbi.usc.edu/">my alma mater</a>. Then Monday starts PDC proper. If you&#8217;re going to PDC, some find me in the <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Agenda/UnSessions.aspx#pdc-lounges">PDC Lounges</a>. I&#8217;ll be spending the vast majority of my time there, since I&#8217;ve seen all the content in my track already! </p>
