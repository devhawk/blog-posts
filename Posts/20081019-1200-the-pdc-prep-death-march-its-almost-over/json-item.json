If you\u2019ve been following my <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/devhawk\">Twitter stream<\/a>, you already know that I\u2019ve spent the last two weeks in <a href=\"http:\/\/microsoftpdc.com\/\">PDC<\/a> dry runs \u2013 we went thru almost every session in the track, reviewing content and giving feedback to the speakers. Some were very good (as I <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DevHawk\/statuses\/948784175\">twittered at the time<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/edpinto\/\">Ed Pinto\u2019s<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/channel9.msdn.com\/pdc2008\/TL06\/\">Building WCF Services with WF<\/a> blew my mind). Others, needed more work, but I think will be great by PDC. I got into several disagreements about the best way to present content, had to raise my voice once, and called some speakers \u201ca little creepy\u201d. (No, I\u2019m not telling you which sessions those were.)<\/p>\n<p>After 9 days of dry runs, I spent Friday with <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jasonz\/\">Jason Zander<\/a>, General Manager for Visual Studio, again reviewing almost all the decks with him and some marketing folks. Frankly, spending that much time with my boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss is a bit intimidating, but Jason\u2019s been great and I\u2019m guessing the visibility will be great for my career. I mean, come review time, he won\u2019t be saying \u201cHarry who?\u201d I\u2019ve also gotten to meet people from far and wide across my division, which has been great since I\u2019m still new over here.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately,\u00a0 I can\u2019t talk much about <em>what<\/em> I\u2019ve seen, since as you know most of it is new and being revealed at PDC for the first time publicly. For example, I can tell you Ed\u2019s talk was frakking awesome, but I can\u2019t tell you <em>why<\/em> I think it\u2019s frakking awesome, yet. But I\u2019m queuing up some posts now that I will publish later once the sessions are public. <\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow, I\u2019m back to my \u201cday job\u201d as the IronPython PM. My teammates have been soldering on in my absence \u2013 the one time I was in my office in the past two weeks I joked that no one would recognize me since I\u2019ve been gone so long. We\u2019re coming up on the final release of IronPython 2.0, and my exclusive focus on PDC has left me a mountain of work to do here in the final stretch. <\/p>\n<p>In addition to my teammates, I need to give a quick shout out to <a href=\"http:\/\/channel9.msdn.com\/shows\/WM_IN\/Developers-are-my-life-I-love-them-OK-how-can-you-not-want-to-find-out-more-about-who-said-tha\">Shoshanna Budzianowski<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mswanson\">Mike Swanson<\/a>, without whom I\u2019m not sure I would have survived the past two weeks. Mike is the PDC content owner, so as hard as the past two weeks have been for me, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re worse for him. Shoshanna is the track owner for the \u201cTools and Languages\u201d track (that\u2019s what the TL in the session codes stands for) and I\u2019ve been the main representative for the VS group in the track. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s ever done something like PDC before, but she\u2019s awesome.\u00a0 <\/p>\n<p>I leave Friday for southern California. I\u2019m going down early to see a few friends and to do my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socalcodecamp.com\/session.aspx?sid=96fe471e-e96d-4c82-bfa4-a2f7d4d88387\">Pumping Iron talk<\/a> at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socalcodecamp.com\/\">SoCal Code Camp<\/a> next Saturday. That should be fun since it\u2019s being held at <a href=\"http:\/\/viterbi.usc.edu\/\">my alma mater<\/a>. Then Monday starts PDC proper. If you\u2019re going to PDC, some find me in the <a href=\"http:\/\/microsoftpdc.com\/Agenda\/UnSessions.aspx#pdc-lounges\">PDC Lounges<\/a>. I\u2019ll be spending the vast majority of my time there, since I\u2019ve seen all the content in my track already! <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So it\u2019s been just over a month since my last post, and I think it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s been one of the busiest of my career to date.
