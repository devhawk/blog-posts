Two ex-teammates, Tim Mallalieu and [Jeromy
Carriere](http://dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/jeromyc), have a [new
article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/dotnetinteroperability.asp)
on Enterprise Interoperability between .NET and J2EE posted on MSDN
Architecture Center. Combined with [Simon’s
book](http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/6711.asp) and the [Patterns
and Practices interop
guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/jdni.asp),
there’s alot of good guidance on this topic.
