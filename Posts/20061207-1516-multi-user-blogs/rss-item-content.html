<p>Most of the technical blogs I read are individual blogs (like this one). Yet, most of the political blogs I read are multi-user. Typically, there is a primary poster - such as Josh Marshal from <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/">Talking Points Memo</a>. But TPM has at least four other bloggers on their home page (Paul Kiel, David Kurtz, Greg Sargent, Justin Rood). I wonder why these two blogging communities are so different?</p>
