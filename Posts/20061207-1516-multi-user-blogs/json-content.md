Most of the technical blogs I read are individual blogs (like this one).
Yet, most of the political blogs I read are multi-user. Typically, there
is a primary poster – such as Josh Marshal from [Talking Points
Memo](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/). But TPM has at least four
other bloggers on their home page (Paul Kiel, David Kurtz, Greg Sargent,
Justin Rood). I wonder why these two blogging communities are so
different?
