I finally updated my Architecture Strategy and Evangelist Blogs [OPML
file](http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx). For single updates, DasBlog’s
web interface is fine, but for doing a slew of updates it blows. I guess
that’s why my blogrolls are so out of date. What I really want is an
[InfoPath](http://www.microsoft.com/Office/infopath) form so I can do
all the updates locally and then upload the new file at once. InfoPath’s
integration with [SharePoint](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint)
rocks, I wonder what it would take to get that kind of integration on an
arbitrary web site? Or, alternatively, how to run your blog on
SharePoint? I screwed around with SharePoint as a “personal content
management system” a while back, but the [difficulty in customizing
it](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=154024b0-11d1-42a3-b79f-0baa68f2e57e)
(as well as a lack of time on my part) doomed that.
