<p>I finally updated my Architecture Strategy and Evangelist Blogs <a href="http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx">OPML file</a>. For single updates, DasBlog's web interface is fine, but for doing a slew of updates it blows. I guess that's why my blogrolls are so out of date. What I really want is an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Office/infopath">InfoPath</a> form so I can do all the updates locally and then upload the new file at once. InfoPath's integration with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint">SharePoint</a> rocks, I wonder what it would take to get that kind of integration on an arbitrary web site? Or, alternatively, how to run your blog on SharePoint? I screwed around with SharePoint as a “personal content management system” a while back, but the <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=154024b0-11d1-42a3-b79f-0baa68f2e57e">difficulty in customizing it</a> (as well as a lack of time on my part) doomed that. </p>
