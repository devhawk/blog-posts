Certainly not as bad as being found by searching on
“[shmuck](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/2003/01/13.html#a156)“, but I
got a interesting Google referral today –
“[designer+think+about+pagelayout](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=designer+think+about+pagelayout&btng=google+search)“.
My site come up as the top hit for that search (at least it does right
now). The question is – did the searcher start with that search, or was
that a refinement? I know sometimes when I Google, I come up with some
strange search strings as I try to weed out the irrelevant deadwood. The
joys of full text search…
