<p>Certainly not as bad as being found by searching on &#8220;<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/2003/01/13.html#a156">shmuck</a>&#8220;, but I got a interesting Google referral today &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=designer+think+about+pagelayout&btng=google+search">designer+think+about+pagelayout</a>&#8220;. My site come up as the top hit for that search (at least it does right now). The question is &#8211; did the searcher start with that search, or was that a refinement? I know sometimes when I Google, I come up with some strange search strings as I try to weed out the irrelevant deadwood. The joys of full text search&#8230;</p>
