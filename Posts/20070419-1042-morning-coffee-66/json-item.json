That leaves two team mates and one project member still not blogging.  <\/li>\n<li>Yesterday, I stumbled into some other teams morale event. They were bogarting the cafeteria, so it wasn&#8217;t like I was crashing it or anything. Normally, I wouldn&#8217;t hang around some other teams party, but they had a projector, an Xbox 360 and two copies of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/guitarhero2\">Guitar Hero<\/a>\u00a0so I had to hang out and watch them play head-to-head for a while.
