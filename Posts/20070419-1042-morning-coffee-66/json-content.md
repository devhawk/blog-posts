Yesterday’s Morning Coffee was canceled on account of rain. In my living
room. It’s fixed now.

    about MS Research’s new [High Capacity Color
    Barcodes](http://research.microsoft.com/research/hccb/) technology.
    As he points out, there’s some fascinating gaming potential for
    these barcodes because they have such high capacity (something like
    2kb per square inch) and can be read without special equipment (a
    camera phone should work).
-   According to a [Pew Research Center
    report](http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=319),
    Daily Show/Colbert Report viewers are significantly better informed
    than Fox News viewers. On the other hand, they’re only slightly more
    informed than O’Reilly Factor viewers or Rush Limbaugh listeners so
    it seems like a wash.
-   Speaking of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, you [can now
    download
    them](http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/04/17/the-daily-show-and-the-colbert-report-now-on-vmp.aspx)
    from Xbox LIVE Video Marketplace. But at ~~\$2~~ 160 points an
    episode, it’s cheaper to set my DVR.
-   I recently re-discovered [Remus Rusanu’s SSB
    blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/remusrusanu/default.aspx). He went dark
    for a few months there, but he’s recently posted a new version of
    his [Service Listing Manager utility](http://www.codeplex.com/slm),
    [presented](http://blogs.msdn.com/remusrusanu/archive/2007/04/03/orlando-slides-and-code.aspx)
    SSB at DevConnections and showed how to [implement a managed stored
    proc](http://blogs.msdn.com/remusrusanu/archive/2007/04/11/consuming-event-notifications-from-clr.aspx)
    to receive SQL DDL [event
    notifications](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190427.aspx).
    Event notifications is one of those features I didn’t even realize
    was in SQL.
-   Dottie Shaw, one of the program managers on my project, [has started
    blogging](http://blogs.msdn.com/dotties). That leaves two team mates
    and one project member still not blogging.
-   Yesterday, I stumbled into some other teams morale event. They were
    bogarting the cafeteria, so it wasn’t like I was crashing it or
    anything. Normally, I wouldn’t hang around some other teams party,
    but they had a projector, an Xbox 360 and two copies of [Guitar
    Hero](http://www.xbox.com/games/guitarhero2) so I had to hang out
    and watch them play head-to-head for a while. That looks like a
    *fun* game.
-   Chris Anderson [writes at
    length](http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2007/04/long_tail_enemy.html)
    about the primary enemy of Long Tail economics: “the
    absurdly complicated and expensive process of rights clearance”. His
    case in point is the coming DVD release of WKRP in Cincinnati, which
    has replaced the dozens of songs used as background music with
    “Muzak-style songs that could be licensed in perpetuity for a small
    flat fee” that
    [apparently](http://blog.wired.com/music/2007/04/wkrp_in_cincinn.html)
    “sucked ass”.
