<p>Simon just emailed a bunch of internal architects about the new <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/default.aspx?ForumGroupID=58&SiteID=1">Architecture Forums</a> on Microsoft.com. So far there&#8217;s a <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=228&SiteID=1">general architecture forum</a> as well as one for <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=229&SiteID=1">modeling and tools</a>, with more to come I would guess. </p>
<p>What other forums do you think we need?</p>
