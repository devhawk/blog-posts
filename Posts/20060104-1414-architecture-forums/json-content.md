Simon just emailed a bunch of internal architects about the new
[Architecture
Forums](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/default.aspx?ForumGroupID=58&SiteID=1)
on Microsoft.com. So far thereâ€™s a [general architecture
forum](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=228&SiteID=1)
as well as one for [modeling and
tools](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=229&SiteID=1),
with more to come I would guess.

What other forums do you think we need?
