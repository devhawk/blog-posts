At CES yesterday, Microsoft <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/community\/news\/2009\/0107-kodu.htm\">announced<\/a> Kodu which I\u2019ve <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/03\/08\/Morning+Coffee+41+TechFest+Edition.aspx\">written about before<\/a> under it\u2019s original name Boku. Kodu came out of <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/en-us\/projects\/kodu\/default.aspx\">Microsoft Research<\/a> as a tool for teaching kids how to program. The programming language is very visual and iconic and you use the Xbox controller exclusively for all input. Here\u2019s a screenshot:<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\" src=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/en-us\/projects\/kodu\/programming_ui.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To demo Kodu at CES, Robbie Bach brought a 12 year old girl named Sparrow up on stage to demo. I showed the video to my kids this morning and they went gaga for it. They\u2019re a little young &#8211; Patrick turns 6 next month and Riley turns 4 later this year \u2013 but I think they\u2019ll be able to get the hang of it (with a little help from dad). Below is the video of the CES demo, and there are more Kodu videos at On10 (<a href=\"http:\/\/on10.net\/blogs\/larry\/CES-2009-Matthew-MacLaurin-on-Kodu\/\">Matthew MacLaurin on Kodu<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/on10.net\/blogs\/larry\/CES-2009-Watch-Kodu-in-Action\/\">Watch Kodu in Action<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><iframe align=\"center\" src=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/silverlightApps\/videoplayer2\/standalone.aspx?contentId=keynoteClip5&amp;src=\/presspass\/events\/ces\/channel.xml&amp;WT.cg_n=CES&amp;WT.z_convert=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" height=\"335\"><\/iframe>\n<p>Personally, I think this is brilliant. I have been eagerly waiting a change to play this with my kids for over a year, so I\u2019m very excited that they\u2019re bringing this to market. Seriously, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/halowars\/\">Halo Wars<\/a> just got bumped to the #2 slot on my \u201cMost Anticipated Xbox Games of 2009\u201d list. <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m most interested in how these creations will be shared online. I couldn\u2019t find any details, but Robbie <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/exec\/steve\/2009\/01-07ces.mspx\">specifically said<\/a> \u201cAnd on Xbox Live they can distribute and share those finished games with other people.\u201d Will there be a charge? (\u201cnormal\u201d Community Games <a href=\"http:\/\/creators.xna.com\/en-US\/faq#anchor_2_5\">cost<\/a> between $2.50 and $10 a pop) How will <a href=\"http:\/\/creators.xna.com\/en-US\/faq#anchor_1_12\">parental controls<\/a> affect shared Kodu games? I guess those details will come closer to release.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>As I\u2019ve written before, I originally got the programming bug from a desire to build my own text adventure games. with significant influence from my dad.
