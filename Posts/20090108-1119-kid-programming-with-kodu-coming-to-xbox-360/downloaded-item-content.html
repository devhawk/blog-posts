<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/07/06/The+Inform+Language.aspx">written before</a>, I originally got the programming bug from a desire to build my own text adventure games. with significant influence from <a href="http://cid-885df99f8fd01cd9.profile.live.com/">my dad</a>. Now that I&#8217;m a father myself, I want my kids to have a similar opportunity, even if they never choose to go into the &#8220;family business&#8221;. </p>

At CES yesterday, Microsoft <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2009/0107-kodu.htm">announced</a> Kodu which I&#8217;ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/08/Morning+Coffee+41+TechFest+Edition.aspx">written about before</a> under it&#8217;s original name Boku. Kodu came out of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/kodu/default.aspx">Microsoft Research</a> as a tool for teaching kids how to program. The programming language is very visual and iconic and you use the Xbox controller exclusively for all input. Here&#8217;s a screenshot:</p>

<p>To demo Kodu at CES, Robbie Bach brought a 12 year old girl named Sparrow up on stage to demo. I showed the video to my kids this morning and they went gaga for it. They&#8217;re a little young &#8211; Patrick turns 6 next month and Riley turns 4 later this year &#8211; but I think they&#8217;ll be able to get the hang of it (with a little help from dad). Below is the video of the CES demo, and there are more Kodu videos at On10 (<a href="http://on10.net/blogs/larry/CES-2009-Matthew-MacLaurin-on-Kodu/">Matthew MacLaurin on Kodu</a> and <a href="http://on10.net/blogs/larry/CES-2009-Watch-Kodu-in-Action/">Watch Kodu in Action</a>).</p>

<p>Personally, I think this is brilliant. I have been eagerly waiting a change to play this with my kids for over a year, so I&#8217;m very excited that they&#8217;re bringing this to market. Seriously, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/halowars/">Halo Wars</a> just got bumped to the #2 slot on my &#8220;Most Anticipated Xbox Games of 2009&#8221; list. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m most interested in how these creations will be shared online. I couldn&#8217;t find any details, but Robbie <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/2009/01-07ces.mspx">specifically said</a> &#8220;And on Xbox Live they can distribute and share those finished games with other people.&#8221; Will there be a charge? (&#8220;normal&#8221; Community Games <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-US/faq#anchor_2_5">cost</a> between $2.50 and $10 a pop) How will <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-US/faq#anchor_1_12">parental controls</a> affect shared Kodu games? I guess those details will come closer to release.</p>
