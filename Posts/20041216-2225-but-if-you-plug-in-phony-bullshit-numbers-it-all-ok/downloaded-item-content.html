<p>Looks like the hypocrosy is running wide and deep&nbsp;@ the NHLPA. After claiming for months that the NHL&#8217;s numbers are &#8220;<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=1733664">fundamentally flawed</a>&#8221;, they claim to have pluged those very same numbers into the NHL&#8217;s forcast projects and &#8220;proved&#8221; a difference of nearly a <em>billion </em>dollars, from losing $569 million over three years to making $412 million. Wow, if that&#8217;s true, that&#8217;s some pretty shitty math by the NHL. Of course, it&#8217;s complete bullshit.</p>
<p>The NHLPA&#8217;s argument rests on the projected revenue and player cost growth for the next three years. The NHL projects that revenue will rise at 3% per year while the players claim the NHL&#8217;s own historical numbers suggest that revenue will rise 7.8% per year. And it&#8217;s true that over the past five years, the NHL&#8217;s Y/Y revenue growth has been 7.8%. Of course, during that time, there has been three new teams added as well as TV contracts that have come and gone (the current NHL TV contract w/ NBC is worth much less than the previous one with Fox). If you look at just the past four years &#8211; a much more relevant time frame &#8211; revenue has gone up between 4.3% and 6.4% per year. Given the effect of the lockout, I&#8217;m thinking 3% is a pretty good estimate. </p>
<p>The NHLPA goes on to argue that the NHL&#8217;s own numbers suggest that player salaries will only go up 7.3% rather than the 12% the league suggests. Again, the 7.3% number for five years is accurate, but if you at the&nbsp;player&nbsp;cost growth for&nbsp;01-02 and 02-03 the increase was 11.6% &amp; 11.8% Y/Y. (03-04 was a paltry 1.8% Y/Y increase, but I would attribute that to the looming lockout.) What&#8217;s really scary is that in 01-02 and 02-03, total player costs went up more per year than in the two years prior <em>when new teams joining increased the total number of player jobs!</em> In 00-01, when two new teams (around 50 new players) joined the league, total player cost went up $121 million. The following two years, when no new teams were added, total player cost went up $127 and $144 million respectively. Gee, looks like the 12% estimate is pretty close to reality too. Plus, the league admitted that the player cost growth might drop as low as 9% based on the 24% salary rollback and other deflators the players proposed. But last I checked 3% revenue growth + 9% player cost growth = bad news for the owners in the long run.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking the NHLPA has a bunch of&nbsp;excel users punching in random historical data into the model to see what provides the best outcome for the league. In their &#8220;rebuttal&#8221;, they keep switching&nbsp;their historical model -&nbsp;first they&nbsp;use 10 year historical revenue growth numbers, then they&nbsp;use five year historical revenue and player cost growth numbers. Then, in their final chart uses an unprovided player cost growth estimate that is actually <em>marginally higher</em> than what the league is projecting, cutting the difference from the NHL&#8217;s projection in half to $440 million. </p>
<p>If they can&#8217;t even keep their story straight on their web page, do they really expect to fool anyone else with this Enron-esque number crunching?</p>
