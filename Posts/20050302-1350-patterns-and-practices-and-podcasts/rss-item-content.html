<p><a href="http://www.ronjacobs.com">Ron</a> from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/practices">patterns &amp; practices</a> is not only <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rjacobs">blogging</a> and <a href="http://www.ronjacobs.com/webcasts.htm">webcasting</a> but also <a href="http://www.ronjacobs.com/podcast/podcasts.htm">podcasting</a>. He's got two podcasts up so far. The first is a <a href="http://www.ronjacobs.com/podcast/Feb22.wma">discussion</a> with Billy Hollis about smart client architectures. It's pretty short - just enough to whet your appetite. (Quick plug - Billy is presenting with <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/WeBlog/">Rocky</a> on Smart Client Architecture as part of the TechEd 2005 ARC track.) Ron's <a href="http://www.ronjacobs.com/podcast/Feb22.wma">second podcast</a> is with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scottdensmore">Scott Densmore</a> on EntLib's ConfigurationContext. It's cool stuff, but it's alot harder to follow (for me anyway) topics related to code like this with just audio. Luckily, Scott <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scottdensmore/archive/2005/03/01/382650.aspx">blogged</a> about this as well.</p>
