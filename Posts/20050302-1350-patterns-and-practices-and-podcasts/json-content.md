[Ron](http://www.ronjacobs.com) from [patterns &
practices](http://www.microsoft.com/practices) is not only
[blogging](http://blogs.msdn.com/rjacobs) and
[webcasting](http://www.ronjacobs.com/webcasts.htm) but also
[podcasting](http://www.ronjacobs.com/podcast/podcasts.htm). He’s got
two podcasts up so far. The first is a
[discussion](http://www.ronjacobs.com/podcast/Feb22.wma) with Billy
Hollis about smart client architectures. It’s pretty short – just enough
to whet your appetite. (Quick plug – Billy is presenting with
[Rocky](http://www.lhotka.net/WeBlog/) on Smart Client Architecture as
part of the TechEd 2005 ARC track.) Ron’s [second
podcast](http://www.ronjacobs.com/podcast/Feb22.wma) is with [Scott
Densmore](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottdensmore) on EntLib’s
ConfigurationContext. It’s cool stuff, but it’s alot harder to follow
(for me anyway) topics related to code like this with just audio.
Luckily, Scott
[blogged](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottdensmore/archive/2005/03/01/382650.aspx)
about this as well.
