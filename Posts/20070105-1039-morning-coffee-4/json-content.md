Recurring 8am Friday meetings are not my style.

-   I’ve been tracking WCF for a long time. Yet, it’s still a dauntingly
    large topic. Yesterday I spoke to a friend who works in Windows Live
    who is just beginning to learn about WCF and it’s literally
    overwhelming him. His reaction reminded me of my early reactions to
    COM. It feels like no matter how much you learn about WCF, the
    “pile” of stuff still to learn doesn’t shrink. In contrast, while my
    initial exposure to the .NET Framework was overwhelming, eventually
    I got to the point where I felt like I had a good handle on what was
    in there. 
-   With all the configuration settings in WCF, the number of valid
    combinations is astronomical. While WCF’s configuration based
    approach is arguably more flexible than a code based approach, it’s
    also more complex and harder to debug in my experience. Config
    debugging seems to be an endless cycle of tweaking the config file
    and running the app to see what the effect is. We need better tools
    than
    [SvcConfigEditor](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms732009.aspx).
-   Responding to yesterday’s Morning Coffee, [Jon
    Flanders](http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon/) confirmed via
    email that the built-in SQL WF persistence service “doesn’t recover
    from faults to the last good persistence point” and that “when a
    fault happens, the instance closes and…is removed from the
    persistence database.” Is this the right behavior? I’m thinking it
    depends on the workflow. More on this later.
-   I’m trying to get my teammates to start using the [Beyond Bullet
    Points](http://www.beyondbullets.com/) approach to the various
    presentations we build as a team. Interestingly enough, it’s been
    easier to get my team to adopt an agile development methodology than
    to adopt the Beyond Bullet Point presentation methodology. I would
    have expected the opposite.
-   The Caps [trounced the
    Canadiens](http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=270104023)
    last night, ending a five game losing streak. I’m not that worried
    about the losing streak – the Caps have had several players out with
    the flu. But beating Montreal, who came into the game twelve games
    above .500, so badly is a good sign. And how about
    [Nycholat](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?statsId=3257)?
    Two goals and four assists in seven games since he was called up
    from Hershey. Even more impressive, he’s +2 even though the Caps
    were 2-5 and outscored 24-18 in those seven games while averaging
    nearly 21 minutes of ice time per game. Here’s hoping Nycholat stays
    hot.
