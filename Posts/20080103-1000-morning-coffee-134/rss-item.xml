  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<ul><li>Bill de Hora <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/12/21/durable-and-restful/">responds</a> to a few of my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/05/Durable+And+RESTful.aspx">Durable and RESTful</a> ideas. He points out that relying on a client-generated ID can be troublesome, and recommends using multiple identifiers - one created by the sender, one by the receiver and one representing the message exchange itself. However, the sender ID is vulnerable to client bugs &amp; tampering as Bill points out, and neither the receiver ID nor the exchange ID can be used to determine if a given message is a duplicate. If you don't trust the sender, is it even possible to determine if a given message is a duplicate? </li><li>Pablo Castro <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pablo/archive/2007/12/22/idempotence-on-http-operations.aspx">confirms</a> that there are "practical limits" to what ADO.NET Data Services can do with respect to <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/11/ADONET+Data+Services+And+Idempotence.aspx">idempotence</a>. Nothing in his post was surprising, though I hope it will be more explicitly called out in the final docs. Developers used to the comforting protection of a transaction may be in for a rude awakening. </li><li>Dare Obasanjo has a <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/01/02/DoesC30BeatDynamicLanguagesAtTheirOwnGame.aspx">great post comparing</a> the new features in C# 3.0 to dynamic languages like IronPython. I believe many of the productivity aspects of dynamic languages have little to do with being dynamic.</li><li>Pat Helland <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/12/27/durability-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder.aspx">noodles</a> on durability and messaging, two topics near and dear to my heart (probably from working with him for a couple of years). I'm not sure where he's going with this - his conclusion that "Basically, big, complex, and distributed system are big, complex, and distributed" isn't exactly ground-breaking. But his point that "durable" isn't a binary concept is worth more consideration. Also, his description of IMS only looking at the effects of a committed transaction is very similar to how web sites work, though obviously HTTP isn't durable so you can't make event horizon optimizations like IMS did. </li><li>Tangentially related, Werner Vogels discusses the idea of <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/12/eventually_consistent.html">eventually consistent</a> distributed databases. Today, that's a problem mostly only Internet-scale sites like Amazon deal with. In the near future of continued data explosion + manycore, we'll all have to deal with it. </li><li>Nick Malik <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/12/26/measuring-risk-in-application-portfolio-management.aspx">argues</a> that categorizing enterprise applications by lifecycle is much less useful than categorization based on organizational impact. He might also need a new chair. </li><li>Jesus Rodriguez <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/12/21/sql-server-service-broker-2008-conversation-priorities.aspx">digs into</a> one of SSB's new features in SQL 2008: conversation priorities. </li><li>Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz and Sam Gentile are mixing it up over the definition of SOA. Sam <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2008/01/01/soa-it-s-an-and-not-an-or.aspx">thinks</a> SOA has to include business drivers and Arnon <a href="http://www.rgoarchitects.com/nblog/2007/12/29/SOAIsNotAboutBusiness.aspx">doesn't</a>. I'm with Sam on this, defining "SOA" independently from "Applying SOA" seems pointless. Then again, rigorously defining SOA - much less arguing about said definition - seems like a waste of time in the first place IMHO. </li><li>Wow, this guy Zed is <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">mad at the Ruby community</a>. </li><li>Andrew Baron has <a href="http://dembot.com/post/22117963">8 Reasons Why The TV Studios Will Die</a>. Personally, I think reason #2 - Expendable Middle-Person - is the most important. If content producers can reach consumers directly, what value-add will the networks provide?
