<li>Bill de Hora <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/12/21/durable-and-restful/">responds</a> to a few of my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/05/Durable+And+RESTful.aspx">Durable and RESTful</a> ideas. He points out that relying on a client-generated ID can be troublesome, and recommends using multiple identifiers &#8211; one created by the sender, one by the receiver and one representing the message exchange itself. However, the sender ID is vulnerable to client bugs &amp; tampering as Bill points out, and neither the receiver ID nor the exchange ID can be used to determine if a given message is a duplicate. If you don&#8217;t trust the sender, is it even possible to determine if a given message is a duplicate? </li>
<li>Pablo Castro <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pablo/archive/2007/12/22/idempotence-on-http-operations.aspx">confirms</a> that there are &#8220;practical limits&#8221; to what ADO.NET Data Services can do with respect to <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/11/ADONET+Data+Services+And+Idempotence.aspx">idempotence</a>. Nothing in his post was surprising, though I hope it will be more explicitly called out in the final docs. Developers used to the comforting protection of a transaction may be in for a rude awakening. </li>
<li>Dare Obasanjo has a <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/01/02/DoesC30BeatDynamicLanguagesAtTheirOwnGame.aspx">great post comparing</a> the new features in C# 3.0 to dynamic languages like IronPython. I believe many of the productivity aspects of dynamic languages have little to do with being dynamic.</li>
<li>Pat Helland <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/12/27/durability-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder.aspx">noodles</a> on durability and messaging, two topics near and dear to my heart (probably from working with him for a couple of years). I&#8217;m not sure where he&#8217;s going with this &#8211; his conclusion that &#8220;Basically, big, complex, and distributed system are big, complex, and distributed&#8221; isn&#8217;t exactly ground-breaking. But his point that &#8220;durable&#8221; isn&#8217;t a binary concept is worth more consideration. Also, his description of IMS only looking at the effects of a committed transaction is very similar to how web sites work, though obviously HTTP isn&#8217;t durable so you can&#8217;t make event horizon optimizations like IMS did. </li>
<li>Tangentially related, Werner Vogels discusses the idea of <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/12/eventually_consistent.html">eventually consistent</a> distributed databases. Today, that&#8217;s a problem mostly only Internet-scale sites like Amazon deal with. In the near future of continued data explosion + manycore, we&#8217;ll all have to deal with it. </li>
<li>Nick Malik <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/12/26/measuring-risk-in-application-portfolio-management.aspx">argues</a> that categorizing enterprise applications by lifecycle is much less useful than categorization based on organizational impact. He might also need a new chair. </li>

<li>Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz and Sam Gentile are mixing it up over the definition of SOA. Sam <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2008/01/01/soa-it-s-an-and-not-an-or.aspx">thinks</a> SOA has to include business drivers and Arnon <a href="http://www.rgoarchitects.com/nblog/2007/12/29/SOAIsNotAboutBusiness.aspx">doesn&#8217;t</a>. I&#8217;m with Sam on this, defining &#8220;SOA&#8221; independently from &#8220;Applying SOA&#8221; seems pointless. Then again, rigorously defining SOA &#8211; much less arguing about said definition &#8211; seems like a waste of time in the first place IMHO. </li>
