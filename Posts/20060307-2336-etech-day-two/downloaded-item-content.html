<p>So I ended up writing four and a half pages of thoughts on day two, so instead of one big-ass post, I&#8217;m going to break it up. Of course, I was distracted by the death of my laptop during the morning keynotes. Plus, any notes I have of the session up until the first break are on said dead laptop (I picked up a pad of paper to tide me over until the rental laptop showed up). So your quality may vary.</p>
