<p>I was just talking to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/about-michael-arrington/">Michael Arrington</a>&nbsp;about some Web 2.0 stuff when I realized I&#8217;ve been blogging for <a title="three years now" href="http://devhawk.net/default,date,2003-01-14.aspx">three years now</a>. I started blogging three years and two weeks ago. Doesn&#8217;t seem that long ago I was sitting in a Phoenix hotel room putting the finishing touches on the blog engine that powered the first version of DevHawk. (I <a title="moved over" href="http://devhawk.net/2003/10/06/Back+In+Blog.aspx">moved over</a>to <a title="DasBlog" href="http://www.dasblog.info/">DasBlog</a> just under a year later.) But in reality, there&#8217;s been two kids, a new house, four roles, five managers and a move to campus since I launched my DevHawk Blog. Quite a ride!</p>
