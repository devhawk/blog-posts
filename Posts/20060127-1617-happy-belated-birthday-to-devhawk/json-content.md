I was just talking to [Michael
Arrington](http://www.techcrunch.com/about-michael-arrington/) about
some Web 2.0 stuff when I realized I’ve been blogging for [three years
now](http://devhawk.net/default,date,2003-01-14.aspx "three years now").
I started blogging three years and two weeks ago. Doesn’t seem that long
ago I was sitting in a Phoenix hotel room putting the finishing touches
on the blog engine that powered the first version of DevHawk. (I [moved
over](http://devhawk.net/2003/10/05/back-in-blog/)to
[DasBlog](http://www.dasblog.info/ "DasBlog") just under a year later.)
But in reality, there’s been two kids, a new house, four roles, five
managers and a move to campus since I launched my DevHawk Blog. Quite a
ride!
