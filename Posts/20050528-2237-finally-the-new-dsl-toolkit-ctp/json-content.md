The May CTP of the DSL Toolkit is finally here, [as per Jochen's
blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/jochens/archive/2005/05/27/422753.aspx). The big
new feature is compatibility with VS05 Beta 2, but according to Jochen this
CTP also includes:

  * New features for the model explorer and property browser in the generated designers.
  * New shape type with collapsible compartments like in the Visual Studio Class Designer. 
  * New text templating (code generation) engine with richer features like an include directive.

They haven't updated the 
[DSL Workbench](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/dsltools/default.aspx) 
pages yet, but you get the CTP directly from the 
[Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=57a14cc6-c084-48dd-b401-1845013bf834&amp;DisplayLang=en).
