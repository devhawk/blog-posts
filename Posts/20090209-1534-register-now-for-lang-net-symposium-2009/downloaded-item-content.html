<p>We&#8217;re now accepting registrations and talk proposals for the <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/">2009 Lang.NET Symposium</a>, which will be held on the Microsoft campus April 14th-16th. </p>
<p>For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with this event, the Lang.NET Symposium is an opportunity for programming language designers and researchers from industry and academia to get together and basically geek out for two and a half days. And it&#8217;s not just Microsoft language wonks like <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/talks/1-01 - CSharp3 - Anders Hejlsberg.html">Anders Hejlsberg</a> or platform wonks like <a title="3-07 - Modeling and Languages - Don Box" href="http://langnetsymposium.com/2008/talks/3-07%20-%20Modeling%20and%20Languages%20-%20Don%20Box.html">Don Box</a>. For example, last year we had <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/2008/talks/1-05%20-%20Lively%20Kernel%20-%20Dan%20Ingalls%20-%20Sun.html">Dan Ingalls from Sun</a>, <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/2008/talks/2-01%20-%20Newspeak%20-%20Gilad%20Braha%20-%20Cadence.html">Gilad Bracha from Cadence</a>, <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/2008/talks/Slides/LangNetDVMTalk.pdf">John Rose from OpenJDK</a> and <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/talks/2-06 - PHP - Wez Furlong.html">Wez Furlong from the PHP Project</a> among many others. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the kind of talks we typically have at Lang.NET, the talks from <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/2006/speakers.aspx">2006</a> and <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/2008/talks.aspx">2008</a> are available online.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve attended <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/08/01/Lang+NET+2006+Symposium.aspx">both</a><a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/01/31/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx">previous</a> Lang.NET Symposiums and <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/2008/talks/3-03%20-%20Parsing%20Expression%20Grammars%20in%20FSharp%20-%20Harry%20Pierson.html">spoke at last year&#8217;s event</a>, but this will be my first as a part of the team driving the event itself. We&#8217;ve expanded a little this year, though we&#8217;re still a small conference so the signal-to-noise ratio should still be very high. We barely fit in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e1846ae4-f0c7-456c-a9bb-54fcf2463ead&displaylang=en">Platform Lab</a> last year, so we moved this year&#8217;s event to Microsoft Research&#8217;s <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/Building_99.aspx">sweet new building #99</a>. </p>
<p>This year, we&#8217;re very excited to be <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/12/19/The+Reesersquos+Peanut+Butter+Cups+Of+Language+Conferences.aspx">joined at the hip</a> with Chris Sells&#8217; <a href="http://sellsbrothers.com/conference/">DSL Developers Conference</a>. Those guys over in CSD are working on some <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/oslo/">cool language stuff of their own</a>, so it just made sense to hold the two events in the same space, one right after the other. Note, <u><strong>registration for each event is separate</strong></u>. You&#8217;re welcome to attend both &#8211; we&#8217;d love it if you did &#8211; just make sure you register for both.</p>
<p>As in the past, there is no cost to attend Lang.NET. You get yourself here and find place to stay and we&#8217;ll take care of the content, meals and beers in the evening. Just make sure you let us know you&#8217;re coming and what, if anything, you&#8217;re interested in getting up and talking about by registering at <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com">the Lang.NET Symposium website</a>. </p>
