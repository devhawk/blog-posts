  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ok, ok, I should have changed that text to "Coming only if someone helps". Those talks aren't lost forever, but the videos I have of them are each 7gb and I don't have the anything nearly powerful enough to compress them in a reasonable amount of time (need to get them down to approx 100mb). Expression Media decidied not to open them last time =)

If anyone wants to step up and help out, by all means let me know, but if not they will stay on this external hard-drive forever.]]></wp:comment_content>
