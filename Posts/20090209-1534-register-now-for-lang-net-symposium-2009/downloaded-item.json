And it\u2019s not just Microsoft language wonks like <a href=\"http:\/\/langnetsymposium.com\/talks\/1-01 - CSharp3 - Anders Hejlsberg.html\">Anders Hejlsberg<\/a> or platform wonks like <a title=\"3-07 - Modeling and Languages - Don Box\" href=\"http:\/\/langnetsymposium.com\/2008\/talks\/3-07%20-%20Modeling%20and%20Languages%20-%20Don%20Box.html\">Don Box<\/a>. For example, last year we had <a href=\"http:\/\/langnetsymposium.com\/2008\/talks\/1-05%20-%20Lively%20Kernel%20-%20Dan%20Ingalls%20-%20Sun.html\">Dan Ingalls from Sun<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/langnetsymposium.com\/2008\/talks\/2-01%20-%20Newspeak%20-%20Gilad%20Braha%20-%20Cadence.html\">Gilad Bracha from Cadence<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/langnetsymposium.com\/2008\/talks\/Slides\/LangNetDVMTalk.pdf\">John Rose from OpenJDK<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/langnetsymposium.com\/talks\/2-06 - PHP - Wez Furlong.html\">Wez Furlong from the PHP Project<\/a> among many others. <\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re curious about the kind of talks we typically have at Lang.NET, the talks from <a href=\"http:\/\/langnetsymposium.com\/2006\/speakers.aspx\">2006<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/langnetsymposium.com\/2008\/talks.aspx\">2008<\/a> are available online.\u00a0 <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve attended <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/08\/01\/Lang+NET+2006+Symposium.aspx\">both<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/01\/31\/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx\">previous<\/a> Lang.NET Symposiums and <a href=\"http:\/\/langnetsymposium.com\/2008\/talks\/3-03%20-%20Parsing%20Expression%20Grammars%20in%20FSharp%20-%20Harry%20Pierson.html\">spoke at last year\u2019s event<\/a>, but this will be my first as a part of the team driving the event itself. We\u2019ve expanded a little this year, though we\u2019re still a small conference so the signal-to-noise ratio should still be very high. We barely fit in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyID=e1846ae4-f0c7-456c-a9bb-54fcf2463ead&amp;displaylang=en\">Platform Lab<\/a> last year, so we moved this year\u2019s event to Microsoft Research\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/en-us\/news\/features\/Building_99.aspx\">sweet new building #99<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>This year, we\u2019re very excited to be <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/12\/19\/The+Reesersquos+Peanut+Butter+Cups+Of+Language+Conferences.aspx\">joined at the hip<\/a> with Chris Sells\u2019 <a href=\"http:\/\/sellsbrothers.com\/conference\/\">DSL Developers Conference<\/a>. Those guys over in CSD are working on some <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/oslo\/\">cool language stuff of their own<\/a>, so it just made sense to hold the two events in the same space, one right after the other. Note, <u><strong>registration for each event is separate<\/strong><\/u>. You\u2019re welcome to attend both \u2013 we\u2019d love it if you did &#8211; just make sure you register for both.<\/p>\n<p>As in the past, there is no cost to attend Lang.NET. You get yourself here and find place to stay and we\u2019ll take care of the content, meals and beers in the evening. Just make sure you let us know you\u2019re coming and what, if anything, you\u2019re interested in getting up and talking about by registering at <a href=\"http:\/\/langnetsymposium.com\">the Lang.NET Symposium website<\/a>. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We\u2019re now accepting registrations and talk proposals for the 2009 Lang.NET Symposium, which will be held on the Microsoft campus April 14th-16th.
