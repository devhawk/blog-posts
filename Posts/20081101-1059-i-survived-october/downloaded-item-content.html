<p>It&#8217; felt touch and go at times, but I did manage to make it thru PDC prep, PDC itself, shipping <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=17404">IPy 2.0 RC1</a> and Halloween relatively unscathed. I was Superman for Halloween &#8211; the perils of letting the five year old pick everyone&#8217;s costume, we we&#8217;re *all* Superman (well, Jules and Riley were Supergirl) &#8211; but given how exhausted I was, I could have skipped the costume and just gone as a zombie. </p>
<p>My inbox is currently just under 500 messages, I&#8217;ve got a mountain of stuff to finish for IPy RTM, I&#8217;m presenting at the <a href="http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2008/west2008.aspx">p&amp;p Summit</a> and I&#8217;m finally get some attention from the legal dept (now that we&#8217;re past PDC). In other words, it&#8217;s not the end of PDC is ushering in a golden age of zero work for Harry. But with PDC in my rear view mirror, I don&#8217;t feel quite so overwhelmed as I did.</p>
<p>And on top of all this, I&#8217;ve been borderline obsessed with election news. I&#8217;ve basically given up on all my non-political blog reading &#8211; if I hadn&#8217;t been working on PDC I might not have even been aware of the big announcements like Oslo and Azure. Things are looking good for Obama and the Democrats, but as this <a href="https://donate.barackobama.com/page/contribute/finishline1">hilarious video shows</a> &#8220;Being in a good position to win is not the same as winning.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t had the time to volunteer for Obama but my father has been volunteering for Obama in Northern Virginia &#8211; aka &#8220;<a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hby_5Pku5ywmfC_rEtEV5BcYKR5gD93KDFPO0">communist country</a>&#8221;. It sure would be nice to see my home state go blue.</p>
