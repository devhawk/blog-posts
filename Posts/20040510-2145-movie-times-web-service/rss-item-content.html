<p>There are a wide variety of web pages to get movie times information. How about web services? My wife and I went to see a movie on Saturday (<a href="http://www.eternalsunshine.com/">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a> - loved it). On the way there, we got worried we weren't going to make it in time. I figured I'd check if there was any other movies starting a little later in case we didn't get there in time. Of course, I have <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=75f886b0-06db-4cf1-9534-604a518841f8">my new Smartphone</a>, so I wanted to use it. This turned out to be much more difficult than it should have been.</p><p>MSN Mobile entertainment section was useless - lottery and horoscope only. There don't seem to be many sites tuned for smartphone access. TV Guide has a smartphone site - in case I want to check what's on TV while I'm out?</p><p>I want a program that downloads local theatre movie times into my phone. Not too much to ask. In fact, I'd write it myself and give it away <em>if</em> there was a simple source for the data. However, for all the movie time sites, I can't find a web service or even a source for the raw data.</p><p>Is there a movie times web service that I just don't know about? If there isn't where do the movie sites get their movie times data and how can I get a copy?</p>
