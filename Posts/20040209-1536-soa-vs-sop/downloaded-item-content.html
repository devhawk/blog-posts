<p>Don <a href="http://goran.polymorphic.se/blog/CommentView.aspx?guid=22254124-1620-4cee-88f5-1cd1bfe9dd4c">pointed out</a> to Goran that the Indigo definition of &#8220;a service is simply a program that one interacts with via message exchanges.&#8221; Goran <a href="http://goran.polymorphic.se/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e252a4b8-9603-4e79-902e-8b543899ab01">pointed out</a> that that definition &#8220;really doesn&#8217;t highlight how it&#8217;ll help a customer&#8221;. I think part of the reason they are both right is that they are talking about different things. I would say Don is talking about Service Oriented Programming where Goran is talking about Service Oriented Architecture. This gets back to the levels of architecture that I <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e583e2ef-b99b-4500-8061-b01e550a15a6">blogged about</a>. Platform tools like Indigo are components used in systems. I&#8217;m guessing the customer&#8217;s Goran mentioned are at the system-of-system level for whom the messaging plumbing is below the abstraction level they care about.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Of course, SO* buzzwords are thrown about with such frequency these days it&#8217;s hard to keep track of the difference.</p>
