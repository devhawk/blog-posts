<p>I called it an early night yesterday (which explains why I&#8217;m blogging this today instead of last night) but I did go to the OOPSLA welcome reception. Ran into <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin</a> again who pointed me in <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings.html">Gregor&#8217;s</a> direction. Gregor presented at TechEd last year and was one of the top five speakers in the architecture track so we chatted about doing it again at next year&#8217;s TechEd. (I also got a chance to meet EIP&#8217;s co-author <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog.jspa?blog=392">Bobby Woolf</a>). Then Martin introduced several other attendees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joshua Kerievsky, author of <a href="http://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/">Refactoring to Patterns</a></li>
<li>Michael Feathers, author of <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/bookstore/books/welc/">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a></li>
<li>Gerard Meszaros, who runs <a href="http://www.xunitpatterns.com/">XUnitPatterns.com</a></li>
<li>Mark Striebeck, Director of <a href="http://www.vasoftware.com/sourceforge/index.php">SourceForge</a> Engineering</li>
</ul>
<p>We all stood around chatting for a good while. I learned quite a bit and now have to add a few books to my very long reading list. I hadn&#8217;t realized that SourceForge is a <a href="http://www.vasoftware.com/sourceforge/index.php">product</a> in addition to being an <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">OSS code repository</a>. Actually, their aren&#8217;t exactly the same &#8211; for example SF.net is built on PHP/Perl/Python while SF Enterprise Edition is built on J2EE. As we all started to drift off, Mark mentioned that he appreciated talking with me since didn&#8217;t always talk in &#8220;glowing terms&#8221; about MSFT. Hey, we do a lot right, but that means there&#8217;s always areas we can improve on and I always err on the side of honesty and transparency.</p>
