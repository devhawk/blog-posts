I called it an early night yesterday (which explains why I’m blogging
this today instead of last night) but I did go to the OOPSLA welcome
reception. Ran into [Martin](http://martinfowler.com/) again who pointed
me in
[Gregor’s](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings.html)
direction. Gregor presented at TechEd last year and was one of the top
five speakers in the architecture track so we chatted about doing it
again at next year’s TechEd. (I also got a chance to meet EIP’s
co-author [Bobby
Woolf](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog.jspa?blog=392)).
Then Martin introduced several other attendees:

-   Joshua Kerievsky, author of [Refactoring to
    Patterns](http://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/)
-   Michael Feathers, author of [Working Effectively with Legacy
    Code](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/bookstore/books/welc/)
-   Gerard Meszaros, who runs
    [XUnitPatterns.com](http://www.xunitpatterns.com/)
-   Mark Striebeck, Director of
    [SourceForge](http://www.vasoftware.com/sourceforge/index.php)
    Engineering

We all stood around chatting for a good while. I learned quite a bit and
now have to add a few books to my very long reading list. I hadn’t
realized that SourceForge is a
[product](http://www.vasoftware.com/sourceforge/index.php) in addition
to being an [OSS code repository](http://sourceforge.net/). Actually,
their aren’t exactly the same – for example SF.net is built on
PHP/Perl/Python while SF Enterprise Edition is built on J2EE. As we all
started to drift off, Mark mentioned that he appreciated talking with me
since didn’t always talk in “glowing terms” about MSFT. Hey, we do a lot
right, but that means there’s always areas we can improve on and I
always err on the side of honesty and transparency.
