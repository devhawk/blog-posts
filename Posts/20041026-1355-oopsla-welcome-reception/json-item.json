Ran into <a href=\"http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/\">Martin<\/a> again who pointed me in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com\/ramblings.html\">Gregor&#8217;s<\/a> direction. Gregor presented at TechEd last year and was one of the top five speakers in the architecture track so we chatted about doing it again at next year&#8217;s TechEd. (I also got a chance to meet EIP&#8217;s co-author <a href=\"http:\/\/www-106.ibm.com\/developerworks\/blogs\/dw_blog.jspa?blog=392\">Bobby Woolf<\/a>). Then Martin introduced several other attendees:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Joshua Kerievsky, author of <a href=\"http:\/\/industriallogic.com\/xp\/refactoring\/\">Refactoring to Patterns<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Michael Feathers, author of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.objectmentor.com\/resources\/bookstore\/books\/welc\/\">Working Effectively with Legacy Code<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Gerard Meszaros, who runs <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xunitpatterns.com\/\">XUnitPatterns.com<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Mark Striebeck, Director of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vasoftware.com\/sourceforge\/index.php\">SourceForge<\/a> Engineering<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We all stood around chatting for a good while. I learned quite a bit and now have to add a few books to my very long reading list. I hadn&#8217;t realized that SourceForge is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vasoftware.com\/sourceforge\/index.php\">product<\/a> in addition to being an <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/\">OSS code repository<\/a>. Actually, their aren&#8217;t exactly the same &#8211; for example SF.net is built on PHP\/Perl\/Python while SF Enterprise Edition is built on J2EE. As we all started to drift off, Mark mentioned that he appreciated talking with me since didn&#8217;t always talk in &#8220;glowing terms&#8221; about MSFT. Hey, we do a lot right, but that means there&#8217;s always areas we can improve on and I always err on the side of honesty and transparency.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I called it an early night yesterday (which explains why I&#8217;m blogging this today instead of last night) but I did go to the OOPSLA welcome reception.
