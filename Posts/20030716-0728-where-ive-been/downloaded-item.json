Pretty cool. I&#8217;m still digesting it, so more thoughts on this later. <\/li>\n<li>I haven&#8217;t worked on <a href=\"prj_sharepointsynd.aspx\">SharePoint Syndication<\/a> at all since releasing v0.4.1. A few hearty souls have joined the workspace, but I haven&#8217;t even contacted them beyond admitting them as workspace members. I was thinking that for v0.5, the big feature would be to support some SharePoint Portal Server things for syndication (my site, best bets, searches, etc) but I haven&#8217;t even had time to get the B2TR version of SharePoint Portal installed.<\/li>\n<li>I got the go-ahead from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sellsbrothers.com\">Chris Sells<\/a> to host his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sellsbrothers.com\/tools\/#imcli\"> imcli<\/a> library as part of a <a href=\"prj_messenger.aspx\"> Messenger.NET<\/a> GDN Workspace.
