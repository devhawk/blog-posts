  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that the owners have the players on their knees.  It won't be long before the 3rd and 4th liners revolt.  Why would they give up years of their career over a couple hundred thousand bucks?  So that Peter Forsberg can continue to make the big bucks?  I doubt it.

It's going to get ugly.  But the owners are not going to capitulate on this one.]]></wp:comment_content>
