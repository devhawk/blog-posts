<p>As he <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2005/03/03/384636.aspx">wrote</a> on his blog, <a href="http://pathelland.com/">Pat Helland&#8217;s</a> last day at Microsoft is tomorrow. He&#8217;s busily cleaning out his office right now. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_sad.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group565" alt=":(">  He&#8217;s starts on Monday @ Amazon to help them implement a service oriented architecture. I heard their <a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000534.html">CTO</a> was <a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu:9000/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=538">hiring</a>.&nbsp; Pat&#8217;s a big reason why I came to work for Architecture Strategy so I&#8217;m really sorry to see him go. </p>
<p>On the plus side, no one will quip &#8220;it&#8217;s been nice hanging out with you&#8221; in the men&#8217;s room anymore. </p>
<p>Seriously, Pat&#8217;s been through some seriously hard times this past twelve months, and I think the change is a great opportunity for him. I imagine I&#8217;ll see him often enough &#8211; he&#8217;s back on campus next week to present at an architecture forum. Plus, I offered to setup dasBlog on pathelland.com so he&#8217;ll keep blogging. </p>
