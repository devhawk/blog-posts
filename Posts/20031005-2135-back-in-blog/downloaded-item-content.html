<p>I did say I was going to go dark for a while. Of course, I wasn&#8217;t expecting to burn my hand on the BBQ grill, get a toothache or for my son to come down with what might be Whooping Cough.</p>
<p>One of the things I&#8217;ve been up to is updating my blog software. Well, not as much updating as migrating to <a href="http://dasblog.net">DasBlog</a>. I&#8217;ve made a bunch of changes to support my current functionality as well as my look and feel. I&#8217;ve even built a CDF feed for DasBlog. Clemens <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=cbc434d4-535b-464c-885e-6d81296449d7"> wants one</a>. DevHawk currently <a href="cdf.aspx">has one</a>. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out how to do my projects and articles sections. It does mean that many of my existing links will break, but I am working on path rewrites to minimize the hassle.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;ll be using DasBlog on my personal blog, I&#8217;ll also be working with <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/">ScottW</a> on <a href="http://scottwater.com/dottext/">.Text</a>. DasBlog rocks as a single user blog, but .Text is a great engine for a hosted weblog community.</p>
