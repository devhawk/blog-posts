Well, not as much updating as migrating to <a href=\"http:\/\/dasblog.net\">DasBlog<\/a>. I&#8217;ve made a bunch of changes to support my current functionality as well as my look and feel. I&#8217;ve even built a CDF feed for DasBlog. Clemens <a href=\"http:\/\/staff.newtelligence.net\/clemensv\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=cbc434d4-535b-464c-885e-6d81296449d7\"> wants one<\/a>. DevHawk currently <a href=\"cdf.aspx\">has one<\/a>. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out how to do my projects and articles sections. It does mean that many of my existing links will break, but I am working on path rewrites to minimize the hassle.<\/p>\n<p>While I&#8217;ll be using DasBlog on my personal blog, I&#8217;ll also be working with <a href=\"http:\/\/scottwater.com\/blog\/\">ScottW<\/a> on <a href=\"http:\/\/scottwater.com\/dottext\/\">.Text<\/a>. DasBlog rocks as a single user blog, but .Text is a great engine for a hosted weblog community.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I did say I was going to go dark for a while.
