<p>Just got back from seeing <a href="http://dreamcatchermovie.warnerbros.com/"> Dreamcatcher</a>. Didn&#8217;t get to see it when it first came out for <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=16e48c40-21ed-480f-a51f-70f88755901f">obvious reasons</a>. My wife Julie read the book and enjoyed it &#8211; which is surprising since she doesn&#8217;t typically like <a href="http://www.stephenking.com">Stephen King</a> books. I liked it &#8211; looking forward to going back and reading the book myself.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons to see Dreamcatcher now was because of the <a href="http://www.intothematrix.com/">AniMatrix</a> short &#8220;<a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/animatrix_frames_osiris.html">Final Flight of the Osiris</a>&#8220;. I was reading the <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew">EW</a> cover story on Matrix Reloaded which also talked about the AniMatrix DVD. It mentioned that &#8220;Osiris&#8221; was a lead-in to the events of Reloaded and the <a href="http://www.enterthematrixgame.com">Enter the Matrix</a> game so I had to go see it. Didn&#8217;t disappoint. Worth it to see even if you walk out before Dreamcatcher starts.</p>
<p><a href="http://objective.mine.nu/archive/2003/4/13.aspx#when:19:16:30.5850352"> Chris</a> points out the Japanese trailer which I missed &#8211; pondering if I should go check it out. If it&#8217;s got a spoiler, I might just give it a pass until after I see Reloaded.</p>
