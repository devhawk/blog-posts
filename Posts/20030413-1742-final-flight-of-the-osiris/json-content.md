Just got back from seeing
[Dreamcatcher](http://dreamcatchermovie.warnerbros.com/). Didn’t get to
see it when it first came out for [obvious
reasons](PermaLink.aspx?guid=16e48c40-21ed-480f-a51f-70f88755901f). My
wife Julie read the book and enjoyed it – which is surprising since she
doesn’t typically like [Stephen King](http://www.stephenking.com) books.
I liked it – looking forward to going back and reading the book myself.

One of the primary reasons to see Dreamcatcher now was because of the
[AniMatrix](http://www.intothematrix.com/) short “[Final Flight of the
Osiris](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/animatrix_frames_osiris.html)“.
I was reading the [EW](http://www.ew.com/ew) cover story on Matrix
Reloaded which also talked about the AniMatrix DVD. It mentioned that
“Osiris” was a lead-in to the events of Reloaded and the [Enter the
Matrix](http://www.enterthematrixgame.com) game so I had to go see it.
Didn’t disappoint. Worth it to see even if you walk out before
Dreamcatcher starts.

points out the Japanese trailer which I missed – pondering if I should
go check it out. If it’s got a spoiler, I might just give it a pass
until after I see Reloaded.
