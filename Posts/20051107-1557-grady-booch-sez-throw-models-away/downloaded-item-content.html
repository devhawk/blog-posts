<p>I wasn&#8217;t there, but apparently <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog.jspa?blog=317">Grady Booch</a> made a comment at <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2005">OOPSLA</a> last month that throwing away models is a good thing. <a href="http://www.metacase.com/blogs/jpt/blogView">Juha-Pekka&#8217;s</a><a href="http://www.metacase.com/blogs/jpt/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3308396982">account</a> of the <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2005/ShowEvent.do?id=304">Design and Modern Software Practices Panel</a> has Grady saying &#8220;when the project gets closer to the delivery you normally throw away UML models. This is a natural choice since the efforts needed for keeping the design &#8211; user view, dynamics, behavior, interaction etc. &#8211; linked with the implementation are simply too high.&#8221; <a href="http://ivan.truemesh.com/">Ivan Moore</a><a href="http://ivan.truemesh.com/archives/000542.html">has Grady saying</a> &#8220;I often throw models away but tend not to throw away the source code.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotta believe that this comment was somehow taken out of context and that the Grand Poobah of the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/12/10/Booch+On+DSLs+Round+3.aspx">Common Semantic Model</a> doesn&#8217;t actually believe that tossing the model at the end o the project is a good thing. If we view these comments thru the lens of <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/10/05/Code+Is+Model.aspx">Code is Model</a>, you realize this is a major violation of the &#8220;Models must be Intrinsic to the Development Process&#8221; tenet. Since code is model, it seems silly to throw out the UML model and keep the code model. The only reason I could think to do that, is because the UML model has no value.</p>
<p>And this leaves me wondering, exactly how much benefit does Grady Booch get from his UML model if he&#8217;s willing to throw them away near the end of the project.</p>
