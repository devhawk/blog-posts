<p>I was going to wait until tomorrow's Morning Coffee to post about <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/news/featurestories/publish/TechFest_2007.aspx">TechFest 2007</a>, but I just realized that <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/presskit/rashid/">Rick Rashid's</a> keynote will be <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/">webcast publicly tomorrow</a> at 9:30 am Pacific time. I don't ever get my Morning Coffee post out that early, so I figured I'd give my readers the heads up now.</p><p>From the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/">TechFest</a> website:</p><blockquote><p>Microsoft Research TechFest provides a strategic forum for Microsoft researchers to connect with the broader group of Microsoft employees and product managers. Hundreds of researchers from Microsoft’s worldwide labs in China, England, India and the US gather for the annual event at the company’s corporate headquarters in Redmond, Washington. They come together to exchange ideas with colleagues, show off their latest innovations, and shine a light into the future of computing. In many cases, the partnerships formed at TechFest between researchers and product teams allow innovations to begin making their way into game-changing products for Microsoft customers.</p></blockquote><p>I've been to every TechFest so far, even the first one when I lived in L.A. (got special permission my my manager to come up for it) and the one where I was on paternity leave after Patrick was born (got special permission from my wife to be leave her alone with a three week old). This one is no different. In fact, I think my whole team is going up on Wednesday. </p><p>Last week was been slow, but with GDC and TechFest I'm thinking this week will be much more lively.</p>
