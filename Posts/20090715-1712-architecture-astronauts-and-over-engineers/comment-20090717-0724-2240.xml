  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[@Michael, as I've said above "I will readily admit that often a single person is responsible for both architecture and engineering. But that doesn't make them the same activity."

@Eric, I never intimated that "that use of interfaces, respect for visibility of type members and use of dependency injection" == over-engineering. There are good reasons to use those techniques that has exactly zero to do with thinking you can predict the future. There's good engineering and then there's over engineering. I guess that's will be the subject of my next Architecture post!]]></wp:comment_content>
