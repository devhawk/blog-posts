  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm a little concerned with the intimation that use of interfaces, respect for visibility of type members and use of dependency injection equates to "over-engineering".  As with everything, it depends on what you're trying to achieve, and generalisations in this regard, especially when junior people who may not understand what's at stake are reading, can be damaging.

I find it an uphill battle to engender a constructive mindset in developers who have established bad habits and whose pride lies in the way of addressing those habits.

Anti-"process" talk by Joel Spolsky and the "pragmatism brigade" makes it harder.  A while ago I had a new developer refuse to write unit tests despite it being an established practice in our team because "... Jeff and Joel said they were bad in the StackOverflow podcast ...".  Yikes.]]></wp:comment_content>
