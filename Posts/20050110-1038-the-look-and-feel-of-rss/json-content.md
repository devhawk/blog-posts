about how he chose what blog service to use. His criteria were: 1) ease
of use and 2) look of the final product. (Of course, look of the final
product was important to Norman – he’s in marketing!) As a developer and
architect, I originally cared most about “rolling my own”, though I
switched over to dasBlog about a year ago. (I just don’t have the time
to roll-my-own as often as I used to.) However, given that I had
invested significant effort into the look of my final product, that
factor was important to me as well, which is one of the reasons I chose
dasBlog over .TEXT.

Of course, what’s funny about investing so much time thinking about the
blog template is that I think most people read the site via RSS, not
HTML. Chris Anderson of “The Long Tail” [wrote about
this](http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/blog_design_in_.html)
a while back. Maybe I should invest a little effort into the new
[dasBlog Community Edition](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblogce)
effort – I’d like to see the number of times the RSS feed is downloaded
vs. the number of times the home page is downloaded.

Norman further goes on to discuss the fact that his blog is hosted on
Blogger, which of course is now owned by Google. I like his point that
“Interoperability and mixed environments is the way the world works. If
it is good enough for my customers, it is good enough for me.”
