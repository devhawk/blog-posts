His criteria were: 1) ease of use and 2) look of the final product. (Of course, look of the final product was important to Norman &#8211; he&#8217;s in marketing!) As a developer and architect, I originally cared most about &#8220;rolling my own&#8221;, though I switched over to dasBlog about a year ago. (I just don&#8217;t have the time to roll-my-own as often as I used to.) However, given that I had invested significant effort into the look of my final product, that factor was important to me as well, which is one of the reasons I chose dasBlog over .TEXT.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, what&#8217;s funny about investing so much time thinking about the blog template is that I think most people read the site via RSS, not HTML. Chris Anderson of &#8220;The Long Tail&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/longtail.typepad.com\/the_long_tail\/2004\/12\/blog_design_in_.html\">wrote about this<\/a> a while back. Maybe I should invest a little effort into the new <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/dasblogce\">dasBlog Community Edition<\/a> effort &#8211; I&#8217;d like to see the number of times the RSS feed is downloaded vs. the number of times the home page is downloaded.<\/p>\n<p>Norman further goes on to discuss the fact that his blog is hosted on Blogger, which of course is now owned by Google. I like his point that &#8220;Interoperability and mixed environments is the way the world works. If it is good enough for my customers, it is good enough for me.&#8221;<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Norman blogs about how he chose what blog service to use.
