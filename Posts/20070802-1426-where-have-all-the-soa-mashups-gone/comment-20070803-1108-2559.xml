  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Those mashups are stuffed into a shoebox along with our web services.  Four years ago, weren't there meant to be *millions* of web services thriving in a new market?  What happened (hint -- it had nothing to do with WS-*)?  

It's one thing to show a mashup, quite another to commercially rely on a mashup, and yet another to profit when mashups use your content.  

Viable, cross-enterprise, commercial mashups have startup with large commodity/service companies like FedEx content embedded in an eCommerce site (where's my stuff?).  But beyond that, it will be vertical applications that are further automating a specific business chain.  I think you'll find web services have submerged similarly to industry-specific applications.
