<ul><li>Morning Coffee is late this morning because we went for our Christmas portrait this morning and it took for<em>ever</em>. The pictures turned out great though.</li><li>Nick Malik finishes up his series on business operation models by covering the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/11/13/soa-in-the-diversification-model.aspx" target="_blank">diversification model</a>. Also, Nick's points about the synergy between a diversified model and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/10/19/soa-in-the-coordination-model.aspx" target="_blank">the coordinated model</a> are spot on. I happen to be a big fan of those models (aka the models with low standardization) which probably drives some of the  more my "unique" perspectives on SOA.</li><li>Scott Guthrie starts out a new series and future technology, this time it's ASP.NET MVC Framework that gets the series treatment. The <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/13/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-1.aspx" target="_blank">first entry</a> in the series is a general overview. I wonder why there's no cool code name for the MVC framework? Whatever it's named, I like the auto routing and action rules - it seems very Rails-inspired. </li><li>Over the weekend, Don Box points out that the REST authentication story "blows chunks". I've recently given up on the reliable part of the original "<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996535.aspx" target="_blank">Secure, Reliable, Transacted Web Services</a>" vision - and I never believed the transacted part. Security, on the other hand, is the one part of that original vision that has worked out IMO. My experience with the WS-* security stack has been pretty good, though Dare Obasanjo <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/11/12/OpenIDOAuthIsTheFinalNailInTheCoffinOfTheWSVsRESTDiscussion.aspx" target="_blank">thinks</a> that <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> and <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> are the final nail in the WS-* coffin. </li><li>Speaking of Dare, he goes on to say <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/11/15/WSIsToRESTAsTheoryIsToPractice.aspx" target="_blank">WS-* is to REST as Theory is to Practice</a>. He makes the point that "The only times I encounter someone with good things to say about WS-* is if it is their job to pimp these technologies or they have already “invested” in WS-* and want to defend that investment." I gave up <strike>pimping</strike> evangelizing technology a while back and I don't want to be in the position of defending a bad investment, so I'm spending lots of time looking at REST.</li><li>Jesus Rodriguez <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/11/15/managed-services-engine.aspx" target="_blank">takes a look</a> at the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicesengine" target="_blank">Managed Services Engine</a> and comes away excited. Jesus is a self-described "strong believer" in SOA governance. I'm a self-described strong disbeliever in SOA governance, so MSE sounds like more of the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/10/25/The+Worst+Of+Both+Worlds.aspx" target="_blank">Worst of Both Worlds</a> to me.</li><li>A little light reading: I pulled <a href="http://www.schneier.com/book-applied.html" target="_blank">Applied Cryptography</a> and <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/thebook.html" target="_blank">A New Kind of Science</a> out of my garage last weekend. Plus my copies of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/" target="_blank">RESTful Web Services</a> and <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/index.html" target="_blank">Programming Erlang</a> just arrived yesterday. </li></ul>
