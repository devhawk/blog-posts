-   Morning Coffee is late this morning because we went for our
    Christmas portrait this morning and it took for*ever*. The pictures
    turned out great though.
-   Nick Malik finishes up his series on business operation models by
    covering the [diversification
    model](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/11/13/soa-in-the-diversification-model.aspx).
    Also, Nick’s points about the synergy between a diversified model
    and [the coordinated
    model](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/10/19/soa-in-the-coordination-model.aspx)
    are spot on. I happen to be a big fan of those models (aka the
    models with low standardization) which probably drives some of the 
    more my “unique” perspectives on SOA.
-   Scott Guthrie starts out a new series and future technology, this
    time it’s ASP.NET MVC Framework that gets the series treatment. The
    [first
    entry](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/13/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-1.aspx)
    in the series is a general overview. I wonder why there’s no cool
    code name for the MVC framework? Whatever it’s named, I like the
    auto routing and action rules – it seems very Rails-inspired.
-   Over the weekend, Don Box points out that the REST authentication
    story “blows chunks”. I’ve recently given up on the reliable part of
    the original “[Secure, Reliable, Transacted Web
    Services](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996535.aspx)”
    vision – and I never believed the transacted part. Security, on the
    other hand, is the one part of that original vision that has worked
    out IMO. My experience with the WS-\* security stack has been pretty
    good, though Dare Obasanjo
    [thinks](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/11/12/OpenIDOAuthIsTheFinalNailInTheCoffinOfTheWSVsRESTDiscussion.aspx)
    that [OpenID](http://openid.net/) and [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) are
    the final nail in the WS-\* coffin.
-   Speaking of Dare, he goes on to say [WS-\* is to REST as Theory is
    to
    Practice](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/11/15/WSIsToRESTAsTheoryIsToPractice.aspx).
    He makes the point that “The only times I encounter someone with
    good things to say about WS-\* is if it is their job to pimp these
    technologies or they have already “invested” in WS-\* and want to
    defend that investment.” I gave up ~~pimping~~ evangelizing
    technology a while back and I don’t want to be in the position of
    defending a bad investment, so I’m spending lots of time looking at
    REST.
-   Jesus Rodriguez [takes a
    look](http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/11/15/managed-services-engine.aspx)
    at the [Managed Services
    Engine](http://www.codeplex.com/servicesengine) and comes away
    excited. Jesus is a self-described “strong believer” in SOA
    governance. I’m a self-described strong disbeliever in SOA
    governance, so MSE sounds like more of the [Worst of Both
    Worlds](http://devhawk.net/2007/10/25/The+Worst+Of+Both+Worlds.aspx)
    to me.
-   A little light reading: I pulled [Applied
    Cryptography](http://www.schneier.com/book-applied.html) and [A New
    Kind of Science](http://www.wolframscience.com/thebook.html) out of
    my garage last weekend. Plus my copies of [RESTful Web
    Services](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/) and
    [Programming
    Erlang](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/index.html) just
    arrived yesterday.
