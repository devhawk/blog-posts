[Jochen](http://blogs.msdn.com/jochens) just posted a list of [known
issues](http://blogs.msdn.com/jochens/articles/360261.aspx) for the [Dec
04 CTP
release](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=57A14CC6-C084-48DD-B401-1845013BF834&displaylang=en)
of the [DSL
Toolkit](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/teamsystem/workshop/dsltools).
I have not had enough time to play with this. Anyone know where I can
get 3-4 more hours a day?
