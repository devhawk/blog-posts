By popular demand, I uploaded a bunch of my scripts to [my
SkyDrive](http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Powershell).
Included are:

-   [Set Powershell
    Home](http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Powershell/Set%20Powershell%20Home.zip)
    – this is actually a zip file that contains the profile redirect
    script. Unzip this in your Documents folder and change the path in
    Microsoft.PowerShell\_profile to where ever you want your profile
    and home directories to live.
-   [\_profile](http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Powershell/%7C_profile.ps1)
    – my “real” profile script. Note, the su function requires the
    [Script Elevation
    PowerToys](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc162321.aspx)
    in order to work. Also, all the various aliases are hard coded to
    their location on my machine. You’ll probably want to change them.
-   [prompt](http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Powershell/prompt.ps1)
    – my prompt script
-   [prepend-path](http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Powershell/prepend-path.ps1)
    – a script to add a directory to start of my path
-   [append-path](http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Powershell/append-path.ps1)
    – like above, but adds the directory to the end of the path
-   [append-path-perm](http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Powershell/append-path-perm.ps1)
    – like append-path, but permanently updates the path in the registry

Enjoy.
