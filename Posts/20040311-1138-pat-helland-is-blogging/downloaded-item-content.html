<p>Pat Helland is the newest member of my team to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland">start a blog</a>. Back in the day, Pat was a co-founder of the Microsoft Transaction Server team. These days, he&#8217;s using the Metropolis analogy to help predict and explain the evolution of architecture. You can catch his Metropolis presentation as part of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series/">Architecture Strategy Series</a>). <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/Rss.aspx">Subscribed</a>&nbsp;plus I&#8217;ve added him to my teammate blog <a href="http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx">OPML file</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to revealing his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2004/03/11/88068.aspx">love of PEZ</a>, Pat&#8217;s got a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2004/03/11/88058.aspx">great dissertation</a> on the multiple meanings of the term &#8220;service&#8221;. One of the issues with SOA is that not everyone agrees on what a &#8220;service&#8221; is. From what I can tell, the most common definition is &#8220;something you build with [insert your favorite vendor]&#8216;s technology&#8221;. Having a vendor-independent description seems like a pretty good idea.</p>
