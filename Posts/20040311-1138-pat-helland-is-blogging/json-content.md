Pat Helland is the newest member of my team to [start a
blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland). Back in the day, Pat was a
co-founder of the Microsoft Transaction Server team. These days, he’s
using the Metropolis analogy to help predict and explain the evolution
of architecture. You can catch his Metropolis presentation as part of
the [Architecture Strategy
Series](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series/)).
[Subscribed](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/Rss.aspx) plus I’ve added
him to my teammate blog [OPML file](http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx).

In addition to revealing his [love of
PEZ](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2004/03/11/88068.aspx),
Pat’s got a [great
dissertation](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2004/03/11/88058.aspx)
on the multiple meanings of the term “service”. One of the issues with
SOA is that not everyone agrees on what a “service” is. From what I can
tell, the most common definition is “something you build with [insert
your favorite vendor]‘s technology”. Having a vendor-independent
description seems like a pretty good idea.
