<p><a href="http://erablog.net/blogs/sean/">Sean Alexander</a> had a link to <a href="http://www.wmplugins.com/ItemDetail.aspx?ItemID=335">WMP Mixer</a> Friday. This is a cool app that lets you have two media streams and mix between them DJ style. </p>
<p>I used to DJ back in college for the campus radio station. We had a remote kit so we could spin tunes for frat parties. Typically, my job at these remotes was to lug heavy DJ equipment, but I did occasionally spin at parties. The one thing WMP Mixer is missing is the ability to preview the next song while the current song is playing. Of course, you&#8217;d need more than the standard single audio out that most PCs have these days. I have a <a href="http://us.hercules.com/products/showpage.php?p=56&b=0&f=1">5.1 sound card</a> that I bought for my Media Center and haven&#8217;t installed. I wonder if you could play media streams to separate channels (rear speakers could be used for preview). I&#8217;m curious if different instances of WMP will let you drive different sound card outputs. I&#8217;m guessing no, since I can&#8217;t seem to find an option to change the sound output of WMP. </p>
