<p>So David Chappel is <a href="http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/">blogging</a>. No, not that <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/207">David Chappel</a>. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://www.davidchappell.com">David</a> speak at several MSFT events &#8211; both internal and external. He&#8217;s great. Only downer is that he&#8217;s using Blogger which doesn&#8217;t support RSS. But <a href="http://web2rss.vyvojar.cz">Web2RSS</a> has <a href="http://web2rss.vyvojar.cz/rss/329.xml">created a feed</a> for him.</p>
