<p>My session yesterday went very well. Current score is 7.95 which makes it the second highest session from the track so far &#8211; John&#8217;s Realizing SOA session currently scores an 8.17 and there are several other sessions in the high 7&#8242;s. It&#8217;s very interesting to watch the scores change. For example, the score for the Metropolis Discussion has gone from 6.8 to 7.08 since yesterday.</p>
<p>After the session, I had a full <span id="rssHarry_dgFeed__ctl3_lblItem">caba&#241;a session that felt like it could have gone on for hours if I hadn&#8217;t cut it short in order to make it to SeaWorld for the attendee party. The party was fun. I spent the early part of the evening hanging out with the overall owner of this year&#8217;s Tech&#183;Ed, next year&#8217;s Tech&#183;Ed, <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/dsmith/">the content owner for Tech&#183;Ed</a> and several of the other track owners. Then, a la PDC, I hung out with <a href="http://peterprovost.org/">Peter</a> and started conversations with whoever walked by. Not as many spontaneous conversations as PDC since the audience at Tech&#183;Ed is only half developers, but still very interesting. Also, having the event in San Diego drew lots of families. Attendees could buy tickets to bring their family members </span>to the SeaWorld party, and it looked like many people took advantage of that opportunity.&nbsp;(Something to keep in mind for next year.)</p>
<p><span id="rssHarry_dgFeed__ctl3_lblItem">It&#8217;s amazing how much work goes into this event. Planning for <a href="https://profile.microsoft.com/RegSysProfileCenter/wizard.aspx?wizid=5f569ef5-960c-4626-bb17-ef94d15cdf50&lcid=1033">Tech<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#183;</span>Ed 2005</a> (Orlando, FL) &amp; 2006 (Boston, MA) is well underway and they are just getting started on Tech&#183;Ed 2007. Thankfully, content planning hasn&#8217;t started yet. There&#8217;s a big internal MSFT conference in July and many of the Tech&#183;Ed track content owners also own content for the internal conference, so I think content planning won&#8217;t start until at least August or September. I was a late addition to the Tech&#183;Ed 2004 virtual team &#8211; I&#8217;m looking forward to being involved much earlier with next year&#8217;s Tech&#183;Ed. I learned a ton this year both by thrown-in-the-deep-end experience as well as observing my fellow track owners who have done this many times. I&#8217;m very happy with this year&#8217;s track, but I know next year will be even better for the Architecture Track! </span></p>
<p>Today should be a easy day hanging out in the <span id="rssHarry_dgFeed__ctl3_lblItem0">caba&#241;a, avoiding mail and having low-key conversations with customers. I fly out tonight &#8211; I get in late, but I just found out I&#8217;m </span>got upgraded to first class so at least I&#8217;ll be comfy. The big question is whether I will watch a movie or start hacking around with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/currentreadme/default.aspx">May VS2005 preview</a>. Given my exhaustion level, I&#8217;m guessing I&#8217;ll go for a movie, but I&#8217;m setting up a new VPC for VS2005 just in case.</p>
