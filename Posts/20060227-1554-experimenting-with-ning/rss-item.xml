  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Last week at Mashup Camp, <a href="http://cheerleader.yoz.com">Yoz</a> showed me <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>. I had heard about Ning, Ning is a social software enabler...I guess enabler is the best word...with a fascinating approach to building software. Well, getting started building software at any rate. While they provide other more basic functions like hosting, Ning provides the ability to clone almost <a href="http://browse.ning.com/application/any">all of the apps</a> running on their site (over 6500 as I write this). When you clone an app, Ning makes a copy of all the files from that app on your own domain (typically appname.ning.com, though you can pay to have your own domain name). They also provide a set of <a href="http://www.ning.com/?view=xapps">basic starter apps</a> that you can clone to get started.</p><p>I decided to try it myself. Behold <a href="http://partisanhacks.ning.com/">Partisan Hacks</a>. </p><p>Partisan Hacks is a clone of Ning's <a href="http://doirock.ning.com/">Do I Rock?</a> starter app, which is itself basically a copy of <a href="http://www.hotornot.com/">Hot or Not</a>. The difference is that you rate how big a partisan hack the individuals are. As I wrote for the About page, I was basically inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stewart">Jon Stewart's</a> now <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2652831">famous appearance</a> on the now cancelled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossfire_(TV_series)">CNN Crossfire</a>. Of course, I've been <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/12/Dennis+Miller+Has+Jumped+The+Shark.aspx">throwing the term around</a> myself a bit lately, hence the reason why the topic was top of mind for me. </p><p>From a technical perspective, I added two features to the basic Do I Rock template code. First, I modified the detail page to include a link to Wikipedia as well as to pull in search results from MSN. Second, I added an RSS feed to the <a href="http://partisanhacks.ning.com/list.php?sort=winner">most partisan</a>, <a href="http://partisanhacks.ning.com/list.php?sort=loser">least partisan</a> and <a href="http://partisanhacks.ning.com/list.php?sort=new">newest additions</a> to the site. I'd never used PHP before, so it took me a bit longer that I would have expected to make the changes, but still it only took me a couple hours to make those as well as other minor cosmetic changes to the site. </p><p>While hacking PHP was somewhat tedious (back to my ASP days of the mid 90's), one area that is both compelling and productive is the <a href="http://documentation.ning.com/sections/basics.php#contentstore">Ning Content Store</a>. It's the shared database on the back end of any Ning application. I didn't really make any changes to my content, but it appears to dead simple to add new info to content objects. I was thinking about how I would build this app w/ ASP.NET, and realized that having to build a custom database would offset most of the productivity I would gain from using ASP.NET instead of PHP. According to <a href="http://documentation.ning.com/sections/roadmap.php">Ning's Roadmap</a>, they'll be bringing <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> support online soon. I'll have to see how much better an experience that is than their current PHP based approach.</p>]]></content:encoded>
