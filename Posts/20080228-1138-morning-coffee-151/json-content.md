-   [Unity’s](http://www.codeplex.com/unity) first CTP was just over two
    weeks ago, but [according to Grigori
    Melnik](http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/02/27/entlib-unity-roadmap.aspx),
    it’s shipping just over two weeks from now. That seems pretty speedy
    to me. By the time I get a change to take a closer look at Unity,
    it’ll probably have shipped.
-   I discovered [Matthew
    Podwysocki](http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/default.aspx) blog
    [via
    DNK](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/patterns/IoC_and_the_Unity_Application_Block_Once_Again).
    I don’t typically subscribe to blogs that I discover via DNK, but
    Matthew has written about
    [IoC/Unity](http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/02/26/ioc-and-the-unity-application-block-once-again.aspx),
    [F\#](http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/02/21/adventures-in-f-f-101-part-2.aspx)
    and
    [DLR](http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/02/08/adventures-in-compilers-building-on-the-dlr.aspx)
    lately so I’m thinking I should be a regular reader.
-   Corporate VP David Treadwell has an [extensive
    post](http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2008/02/27/213.aspx)
    on updates to the Windows Live Platform Services that are being
    unveiled at MIX next week. The updates include the new [WL Messenger
    Library](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc298458.aspx), a
    [new SDK](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc287637.aspx)
    for [WL ID Delegated
    Authentication](http://winliveid.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!AEE1BB0D86E23AAC!1460.entry),
    a [new WL Photo
    API](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb932323.aspx), a new
    CTP of [WL Tools](http://dev.live.com/tools/), [standardized support
    for
    AtomPub](http://blogs.msdn.com/astoriateam/archive/2008/02/13/atompub-support-in-the-ado-net-data-services-framework.aspx),
    updates to [WL Contacts
    API](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb463989.aspx) and
    [Sivlerlight Streaming](http://silverlight.live.com/) and a new
    “experimental” service called Application Based Storage that “allows
    application developers to store a small amount of
    state/configuration data in the WL data centers on behalf of a
    user”. I’m sure there’ll be more WL news at the MIX conference
    proper, but that’s quite a good chunk of features to start digging
    into. Personally, I’m particularly interested in WL Delegated Auth,
    esp. how it deals with phishing, something [I don’t think OAuth
    handles very
    well](http://devhawk.net/2007/11/19/Morning+Coffee+124.aspx).
-   Windows Live isn’t the only group making announcements in advance of
    MIX. Adobe [announced a research
    project](http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/26/adobe-player_1.html)
    that allows “cross-compiling existing code from C, C++, Java,
    Python, and Ruby to ActionScript.” This seems pretty obviously a
    response to Silverlight 2.0′s embedded CLR, announced last year @
    MIX. Support for C++ is very interesting – Adobe evangelist Ted
    Patrick
    [claims](http://www.onflex.org/ted/2008/02/extending-adobe-flash-player-and-adobe.php)
    they were even able to cross-compile Quake 1 to Flash. Interesting,
    but this is an internal research project @ Adobe with no projected
    release date while Silverlight 2.0 goes [into beta next
    week](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/22/first-look-at-silverlight-2.aspx).
