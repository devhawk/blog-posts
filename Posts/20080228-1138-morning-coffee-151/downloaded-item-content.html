<li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/unity">Unity&#8217;s</a> first CTP was just over two weeks ago, but <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/02/27/entlib-unity-roadmap.aspx">according to Grigori Melnik</a>, it&#8217;s shipping just over two weeks from now. That seems pretty speedy to me. By the time I get a change to take a closer look at Unity, it&#8217;ll probably have shipped.  </li>
<li>I discovered <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/default.aspx">Matthew Podwysocki</a> blog <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/patterns/IoC_and_the_Unity_Application_Block_Once_Again">via DNK</a>. I don&#8217;t typically subscribe to blogs that I discover via DNK, but Matthew has written about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/02/26/ioc-and-the-unity-application-block-once-again.aspx">IoC/Unity</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/02/21/adventures-in-f-f-101-part-2.aspx">F#</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/02/08/adventures-in-compilers-building-on-the-dlr.aspx">DLR</a> lately so I&#8217;m thinking I should be a regular reader.  </li>
<li>Corporate VP David Treadwell has an <a href="http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2008/02/27/213.aspx">extensive post</a> on updates to the Windows Live Platform Services that are being unveiled at MIX next week. The updates include the new <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc298458.aspx">WL Messenger Library</a>, a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc287637.aspx">new SDK</a> for <a href="http://winliveid.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!AEE1BB0D86E23AAC!1460.entry">WL ID Delegated Authentication</a>, a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb932323.aspx">new WL Photo API</a>, a new CTP of <a href="http://dev.live.com/tools/">WL Tools</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astoriateam/archive/2008/02/13/atompub-support-in-the-ado-net-data-services-framework.aspx">standardized support for AtomPub</a>, updates to <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb463989.aspx">WL Contacts API</a> and <a href="http://silverlight.live.com/">Sivlerlight Streaming</a> and a new &#8220;experimental&#8221; service called Application Based Storage that &#8220;allows application developers to store a small amount of state/configuration data in the WL data centers on behalf of a user&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be more WL news at the MIX conference proper, but that&#8217;s quite a good chunk of features to start digging into. Personally, I&#8217;m particularly interested in WL Delegated Auth, esp. how it deals with phishing, something <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/11/19/Morning+Coffee+124.aspx">I don&#8217;t think OAuth handles very well</a>.  </li>
<li>Windows Live isn&#8217;t the only group making announcements in advance of MIX. Adobe <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/26/adobe-player_1.html">announced a research project</a> that allows &#8220;cross-compiling existing code from C, C++, Java, Python, and Ruby to ActionScript.&#8221; This seems pretty obviously a response to Silverlight 2.0&#8242;s embedded CLR, announced last year @ MIX. Support for C++ is very interesting &#8211; Adobe evangelist Ted Patrick <a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/2008/02/extending-adobe-flash-player-and-adobe.php">claims</a> they were even able to cross-compile Quake 1 to Flash. Interesting, but this is an internal research project @ Adobe with no projected release date while Silverlight 2.0 goes <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/22/first-look-at-silverlight-2.aspx">into beta next week</a>.</li>
