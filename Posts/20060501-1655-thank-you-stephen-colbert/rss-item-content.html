<p>(Quick reminder, this is my <i>personal</i> blog. Standard <a href="http://devhawk.net/default.aspx#disclaimer">disclaimer</a> applies.)</p><p>I'm guessing the <a href="http://www.whca.net/">White House Correspondents' Association</a> didn't run their choice of dinner entertainment past the actual White House. Last year, Stephen Colbert had <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT5d4vdNK5s">this hilarious bit</a> on Laura Bush's "after hours" show @ last year's dinner.</p><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FT5d4vdNK5s" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FT5d4vdNK5s" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></div><p>I wonder who thought "Let's get the guy that made the joke about President Bush bathing in a bucket of horse semen last year to appear at this year's Correspondent's dinner." Actually, I don't have to wonder. It was Mark Smith from AP Radio, the President of WHCA, who admitted to being responsible for signing Colbert while introducing him Saturday night. This guy considered "<a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/10826561">Colbert: AP is America's #1 threat</a>" a "pit-in-my-stomach, career-in-flames moment". I'm guessing he's in full barf-o-rama mode after <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/4/30/1441/59811">Colbert's stunning performance</a>. This administration isn't exactly known for forgiving and forgetting. I wouldn't be surprised if Mark Smith could get to the White House in the future was the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/whtour/">online tour</a>. </p><p>You can get the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/4/30/1441/59811">transcript</a> from <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/">Daily Kos</a> and the <a href="http://www.leahys.net/blog/?p=113">video</a> from <a href="http://www.vastmoderateconspiracy.com/">Vast Moderate Conspiracy</a>.
