<p>I&#8217;m guessing the <a href="http://www.whca.net/">White House Correspondents&#8217; Association</a> didn&#8217;t run their choice of dinner entertainment past the actual White House. Last year, Stephen Colbert had <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT5d4vdNK5s">this hilarious bit</a> on Laura Bush&#8217;s &#8220;after hours&#8221; show @ last year&#8217;s dinner.</p>

<p>I wonder who thought &#8220;Let&#8217;s get the guy that made the joke about President Bush bathing in a bucket of horse semen last year to appear at this year&#8217;s Correspondent&#8217;s dinner.&#8221; Actually, I don&#8217;t have to wonder. It was Mark Smith from AP Radio, the President of WHCA, who admitted to being responsible for signing Colbert while introducing him Saturday night. This guy considered &#8220;<a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/10826561">Colbert: AP is America&#8217;s #1 threat</a>&#8221; a &#8220;pit-in-my-stomach, career-in-flames moment&#8221;. I&#8217;m guessing he&#8217;s in full barf-o-rama mode after <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/4/30/1441/59811">Colbert&#8217;s stunning performance</a>. This administration isn&#8217;t exactly known for forgiving and forgetting. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Mark Smith could get to the White House in the future was the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/whtour/">online tour</a>. </p>
