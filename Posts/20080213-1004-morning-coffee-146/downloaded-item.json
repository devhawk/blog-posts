TV Guide has <a href=\"http:\/\/community.tvguide.com\/blog-entry\/TVGuide-Editors-Blog\/Ausiello-Report\/Wga-Strike-Favorite\/800032698\">a rundown<\/a> of how and when various shows will resume. I can&#8217;t wait to see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailyshow.com\">Daily Show<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comedycentral.com\/shows\/the_colbert_report\">Colbert Report<\/a> tonight. Lost &#8211; aka the best show on TV &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/community.tvguide.com\/blog-entry\/TVGuide-Editors-Blog\/Ausiello-Report\/Exclusive-Ilosti-Boss\/800033076\">looks like<\/a> it will be getting five more episodes (in addition to the eight shot before the strike).  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of TV, Battlestar Galactica Fans: <a href=\"http:\/\/community.tvguide.com\/blog-entry\/TVGuide-News-Blog\/Todays-News\/Battlestar-Galactica-Returns\/800032799\">circle April 4th<\/a> on your calendar.  <\/li>\n<li>Obama <a href=\"http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/23123924\/\">won all three<\/a> &#8220;Potomac Primaries&#8221; yesterday, and is now the <a href=\"http:\/\/firstread.msnbc.msn.com\/archive\/2008\/02\/13\/661146.aspx\">Democratic front-runner<\/a>, though there&#8217;s a long way to go before the convention. Scott Adams of Dilbert fame has <a href=\"http:\/\/dilbertblog.typepad.com\/the_dilbert_blog\/2008\/02\/experience.html\">a great take<\/a> on presidential experience &#8211; I&#8217;m guessing he&#8217;s an Obama fan.  <\/li>\n<li>In minor acquisition news, Microsoft is <a href=\"http:\/\/virtualearth.spaces.live.com\/Blog\/cns!2BBC66E99FDCDB98!11432.entry\">acquiring<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.caligari.com\/\">Caligari<\/a>, makers of 3D modeling tool <a href=\"http:\/\/www.caligari.com\/Products\/trueSpace\/tS75\/brochure\/intro.asp?Cate=BIntro\">trueSpace<\/a>. The Caligari folks are joining the Virtual Earth team, though I wonder what the XNA folks think of the acquisition. This isn&#8217;t the first 3D modeling product Microsoft ever acquired &#8211; we owned <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Softimage\">Softimage<\/a> for four years in the &#8217;90s.  <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/UsingAnIDEToWritePowerShellScripts.aspx\">Scott Hanselman<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/UsingAnIDEToWritePowerShellScripts.aspx\">Tomas Resprepo<\/a> both write about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.powershell.com\/plus\/\">PowerShellPlus<\/a>, which I saw week before last @ Lang.NET. Scott really likes it, for both PS novices and gurus, but Tomas thinks the UI is busy, based on the screenshots. Personally, I&#8217;m not doing much PS work lately &#8211; occasional one off stuff, but that&#8217;s it &#8211; so it doesn&#8217;t seem worth the effort.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Scott &amp; Tomas, Scott also has a <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/ScottHanselman\/~3\/231269818\/VisualStudioProgrammerThemesGallery.aspx\">nice gallery of VS themes<\/a>. I&#8217;m partial to Tomas&#8217; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winterdom.com\/weblog\/2007\/10\/13\/RagnarokAVS2005ColorScheme.aspx\">Ragnarok Grey<\/a>. Is there a VSThemesGallery.com site somewhere?  <\/li>\n<li>Still speaking of Scott, he <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/ASPNETWikiBeta.aspx\">points to<\/a> the new <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.asp.net\/\">ASP.NET Developer Wiki (beta)<\/a>. I poked around, but didn&#8217;t find anything shiny. I was very surprised that searching for &#8220;MVC&#8221; returned no results.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of MVC, Scott Guthrie <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2008\/02\/12\/asp-net-mvc-framework-road-map-update.aspx\">has a rundown<\/a> on what&#8217;s coming in the MIX preview release of ASP.NET MVC. Biggest news IMO is that it&#8217;s \/bin deployable &#8211; i.e. you don&#8217;t need your hoster to do anything special to support MVC (assuming they already support ASP.NET 3.5). Also big news, they&#8217;re releasing the source so you can build and patch (and enhance?) it yourself.  <\/li>\n<li>Chris Taveres <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tavaresstudios.com\/Blog\/post.aspx?id=3008ff6d-8f02-4dbc-a769-d27273d93e95\">continues<\/a> is ObjectBuilder series and Tomas continues is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winterdom.com\/weblog\/2008\/02\/13\/DLRNotes4.aspx\">DLR Notes<\/a> series. BTW, my F# based DLR experimentation continues, albeit slowly (frakking day job). Hope to be able to post on this soon.  <\/li>\n<li>One of the things driving my interest in F# is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manycore_processing_unit\">manycore<\/a>. An interesting tangent to manycore is general purpose programming on graphics processing units (aka <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GPGPU\">GPGPU<\/a>). MS Research just released a <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/research\/downloads\/Details\/648909e1-cb85-46c4-9a94-3cca55971b1d\/Details.aspx\">new version<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/research\/pubs\/view.aspx?tr_id=1040&amp;0sr=a\">Accelerator<\/a>, just such a GPGPU system. I personally haven&#8217;t played with it &#8211; I&#8217;ve been focused on writing parsers, not parallel code. <\/li>\n<li>Is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/XQuery\">XQuery<\/a> really &#8220;a promising technology of the future&#8221; as <a href=\"http:\/\/pluralsight.com\/blogs\/dbox\/archive\/2008\/02\/07\/50180.aspx\">Don Box suggests<\/a>? I see exactly zero demand or use for it in my day-to-day work. Of course, Don&#8217;s paid to build future platform goo, so maybe it is promising and Don&#8217;s afore-mentioned goo will leverage it, though I remain skeptical. As for XML being &#8220;Done like a well-cooked steak&#8221;, I&#8217;d say XML is like a great steak cooked perfectly, except it&#8217;s done exactly how you <em>don&#8217;t<\/em> like it. You can appreciate its quality, but you don&#8217;t really enjoy it as much as you could have. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>The writers strike is officially over. Everyone goes back to work today.
