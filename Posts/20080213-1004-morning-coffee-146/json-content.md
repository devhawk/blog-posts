-   The writers strike is [officially
    over](http://unitedhollywood.blogspot.com/2008/02/letter-from-presidents-to-membership.html).
    Everyone goes back to work today. Thomas Cleaver has what I thought
    was [the best
    post](http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/14553.html)
    summarizing how the writers won. TV Guide has [a
    rundown](http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Ausiello-Report/Wga-Strike-Favorite/800032698)
    of how and when various shows will resume. I can’t wait to see
    [Daily Show](http://www.thedailyshow.com) and [Colbert
    Report](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report)
    tonight. Lost – aka the best show on TV – [looks
    like](http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Ausiello-Report/Exclusive-Ilosti-Boss/800033076)
    it will be getting five more episodes (in addition to the eight shot
    before the strike).
-   Speaking of TV, Battlestar Galactica Fans: [circle April
    4th](http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-News-Blog/Todays-News/Battlestar-Galactica-Returns/800032799)
    on your calendar.
-   Obama [won all three](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23123924/)
    “Potomac Primaries” yesterday, and is now the [Democratic
    front-runner](http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/02/13/661146.aspx),
    though there’s a long way to go before the convention. Scott Adams
    of Dilbert fame has [a great
    take](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2008/02/experience.html)
    on presidential experience – I’m guessing he’s an Obama fan.
-   In minor acquisition news, Microsoft is
    [acquiring](http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!2BBC66E99FDCDB98!11432.entry)[Caligari](http://www.caligari.com/),
    makers of 3D modeling tool
    [trueSpace](http://www.caligari.com/Products/trueSpace/tS75/brochure/intro.asp?Cate=BIntro).
    The Caligari folks are joining the Virtual Earth team, though I
    wonder what the XNA folks think of the acquisition. This isn’t the
    first 3D modeling product Microsoft ever acquired – we owned
    [Softimage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softimage) for four years
    in the ’90s.
-   [Scott
    Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/UsingAnIDEToWritePowerShellScripts.aspx)
    and [Tomas
    Resprepo](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/UsingAnIDEToWritePowerShellScripts.aspx)
    both write about [PowerShellPlus](http://www.powershell.com/plus/),
    which I saw week before last @ Lang.NET. Scott really likes it, for
    both PS novices and gurus, but Tomas thinks the UI is busy, based on
    the screenshots. Personally, I’m not doing much PS work lately –
    occasional one off stuff, but that’s it – so it doesn’t seem worth
    the effort.
-   Speaking of Scott & Tomas, Scott also has a [nice gallery of VS
    themes](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/231269818/VisualStudioProgrammerThemesGallery.aspx).
    I’m partial to Tomas’ [Ragnarok
    Grey](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/10/13/RagnarokAVS2005ColorScheme.aspx).
    Is there a VSThemesGallery.com site somewhere?
-   Still speaking of Scott, he [points
    to](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETWikiBeta.aspx) the new
    [ASP.NET Developer Wiki (beta)](http://wiki.asp.net/). I poked
    around, but didn’t find anything shiny. I was very surprised that
    searching for “MVC” returned no results.
-   Speaking of MVC, Scott Guthrie [has a
    rundown](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/12/asp-net-mvc-framework-road-map-update.aspx)
    on what’s coming in the MIX preview release of ASP.NET MVC. Biggest
    news IMO is that it’s /bin deployable – i.e. you don’t need your
    hoster to do anything special to support MVC (assuming they already
    support ASP.NET 3.5). Also big news, they’re releasing the source so
    you can build and patch (and enhance?) it yourself.

    [continues](http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/post.aspx?id=3008ff6d-8f02-4dbc-a769-d27273d93e95)
    is ObjectBuilder series and Tomas continues is [DLR
    Notes](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2008/02/13/DLRNotes4.aspx)
    series. BTW, my F\# based DLR experimentation continues, albeit
    slowly (frakking day job). Hope to be able to post on this soon.
-   One of the things driving my interest in F\# is
    [manycore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manycore_processing_unit).
    An interesting tangent to manycore is general purpose programming on
    graphics processing units (aka
    [GPGPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU)). MS Research just
    released a [new
    version](http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/648909e1-cb85-46c4-9a94-3cca55971b1d/Details.aspx)
    of
    [Accelerator](http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?tr_id=1040&0sr=a),
    just such a GPGPU system. I personally haven’t played with it – I’ve
    been focused on writing parsers, not parallel code.
-   Is [XQuery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuery) really “a promising
    technology of the future” as [Don Box
    suggests](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2008/02/07/50180.aspx)?
    I see exactly zero demand or use for it in my day-to-day work. Of
    course, Don’s paid to build future platform goo, so maybe it is
    promising and Don’s afore-mentioned goo will leverage it, though I
    remain skeptical. As for XML being “Done like a well-cooked steak”,
    I’d say XML is like a great steak cooked perfectly, except it’s done
    exactly how you *don’t* like it. You can appreciate its quality, but
    you don’t really enjoy it as much as you could have.
