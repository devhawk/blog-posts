I hope to post my thoughts on protocol state next week. In the meantime,
you can check out [Isolation Support for Service-based
Applications](http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2007/papers/cidr07p36.pdf) as
well as [Consistency for Web Services
Applications](http://www.vldb2005.org/program/paper/thu/p1199-greenfield.pdf).
The papers (from the same authors) deal with the C and I of ACID, but in
service scenarios where ACID transactions aren’t feasible. Both papers
have dramatically impacted my thinking in this space.
