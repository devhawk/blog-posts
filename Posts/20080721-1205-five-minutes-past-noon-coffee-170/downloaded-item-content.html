<li>Ben Hall <a href="http://blog.benhall.me.uk/2008/07/announcing-ironeditor-editor-for.html">announces</a><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronEditor">IronEditor</a>, a simple dev tool for IronPython and IronRuby. Pretty nice, though fairly simplistic (as Ben readily admits). For example, it doesn&#8217;t have an interactive mode, only the ability to execute scripts and direct the output to IronEditor&#8217;s output window. However, it is a good start and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll just get better. One thing he&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/Ben_Hall/statuses/862967588">apparently considering</a> is a Silverlight version. (via <a href="http://twitter.com/voidspace/statuses/862951177">Michael Foord</a>)  </li>
<li>Speaking of &#8220;Iron&#8221; tools, <a href="http://www.sapphiresteel.com/">Sapphire Steel</a> have had an <a href="http://www.sapphiresteel.com/Ruby-In-Steel-For-IronRuby">IronRuby version (in alpha)</a> of their <a href="http://www.sapphiresteel.com/Ruby-In-Steel-Developer-Overview">Ruby in Steel</a> product for several months now. I wonder if <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/">John&#8217;s</a> had a chance to play with it.  </li>
<li>Speaking of John, the ASP.NET MVC / IronRuby prototype he <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/06/ironruby-and-aspnet-mvc.html">talked about @ TechEd</a> is <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/07/20/ironruby-aspnetmvc-prototype.aspx">now available</a> on ASP.NET MVC Preview 4 via Phil Haack.  </li>
<li>Ted Neward has <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/IPyDD">an article</a> exploring the IronPython VS Integration sample that ships in the VS SDK. As I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/07/17/IronPython+Post+20+Roadmap.aspx">mentioned the other day</a>, we&#8217;re starting working on a production quality implementation of VS Integration for IPy.  </li>
<li>Ophir Kra-Oz (aka Evil Fish) blogs <a href="http://ophir.wordpress.com/2008/07/20/python-for-executives/">Python for Executives</a>. I like his &#8220;Risk, Recruiting, Performance and Maturity&#8221; model &#8211; four boxes, perfect for keeping an executive&#8217;s attention! <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group1156" alt=":)">  Plus Ophir has some nice things to say about IronPython. (via <a href="http://twitter.com/voidspace/statuses/863648598">Michael Foord</a>)  </li>
<li>Ronnie Maor <a href="http://www.ronnie-midnight-oil.net/2008/07/easier-python-evaluation-from-c.html">blogs</a> an <a href="http://www.ironpython.info/index.php/PythonEngineEvalExtension">extension method for PythonEngine</a> to make Eval simpler. I especially like how he uses string format syntax so you can dynamically generate the code to eval. I wonder what this would look like in IPy 2.0 with DLR Hosting API. (via <a href="http://ironpython-urls.blogspot.com/2008/07/easier-python-evaluation-from-c.html">IronPython URLs</a>)  </li>
<li>Speaking of DLR Hosting, Seshadri has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/07/17/dlr-hosting-sample-write-event-handlers-for-vs-in-ironpython.aspx">another great DLR hosting post</a>, this time hosting IPy inside of VS08 so you can script VS08 events (document saved, window created, etc) with Python.  </li>
<li>Justin Etheredge has a bunch of IronRuby posts &#8211; <a href="http://www.codethinked.com/post/2008/07/14/Getting-IronRuby-Up-and-Running.aspx">Getting IronRuby Up and Running</a>, <a href="http://www.codethinked.com/post/2008/07/17/Running-Applications-in-IronRuby.aspx">Running Applications in IronRuby</a>, <a href="http://www.codethinked.com/post/2008/07/21/Learning-Ruby-via-IronRuby-and-C-Part-1.aspx">Learning Ruby via IronRuby and C# Part 1</a>. (via <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2008/07/21/new-and-notable-255.aspx">Sam Gentile</a>) </li>
<li>Don Syme <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/07/19/f-and-arcgis-arcobjects.aspx">links</a> to several F# related posts by <a href="http://vernagus.blogspot.com/">Ray Vernagus</a>, though he&#8217;s apparently also <a href="http://vernagus.blogspot.com/2007/10/extension-methods-and-ironruby.html">experimenting with IronRuby</a>. I&#8217;m really interested in his <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521663504">Purely Functional Data Structures</a> port to F#.  </li>
<li>Speaking of F#, Brian has a <a href="http://lorgonblog.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!701679AD17B6D310!282.entry">teaser screenshot</a> of F# upcoming CTP. However, he chooses the New Item dialog to tease, which looks pretty much like the current new item dialog (the new one does have fewer F# templates). However, if you look in the Solution Explorer, you&#8217;ll notice a real &#8220;References&#8221; node. No more #I/#R! Yeah! </li>
<li>The interactive graphic in <a href="http://www.wired.com/special_multimedia/2008/st_infoporn_1607">Kevin Kelly&#8217;s One Machine article</a> is fascinating. It really highlights that the vast vast vast majority of power, storage, CPU cycles and RAM come from personal computers on the edge. Even in bandwidth, where PC&#8217;s still have the highest share but it looks to be around 1/3rd, the aggregate of all edge devices (PCs, mobile phones, PDAs, etc.) still dominates the data centers. </li>
