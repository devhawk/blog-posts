    [announces](http://blog.benhall.me.uk/2008/07/announcing-ironeditor-editor-for.html)[IronEditor](http://www.codeplex.com/IronEditor),
    a simple dev tool for IronPython and IronRuby. Pretty nice, though
    fairly simplistic (as Ben readily admits). For example, it doesn’t
    have an interactive mode, only the ability to execute scripts and
    direct the output to IronEditor’s output window. However, it is a
    good start and I’m sure it’ll just get better. One thing he’s
    [apparently
    considering](http://twitter.com/Ben_Hall/statuses/862967588) is a
    Silverlight version. (via [Michael
    Foord](http://twitter.com/voidspace/statuses/862951177))
-   Speaking of “Iron” tools, [Sapphire
    Steel](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/) have had an [IronRuby version
    (in alpha)](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/Ruby-In-Steel-For-IronRuby)
    of their [Ruby in
    Steel](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/Ruby-In-Steel-Developer-Overview)
    product for several months now. I wonder if
    [John’s](http://www.iunknown.com/) had a chance to play with it.
-   Speaking of John, the ASP.NET MVC / IronRuby prototype he [talked
    about @
    TechEd](http://www.iunknown.com/2008/06/ironruby-and-aspnet-mvc.html)
    is [now
    available](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/07/20/ironruby-aspnetmvc-prototype.aspx)
    on ASP.NET MVC Preview 4 via Phil Haack.
-   Ted Neward has [an article](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/IPyDD)
    exploring the IronPython VS Integration sample that ships in the VS
    SDK. As I [mentioned the other
    day](http://devhawk.net/2008/07/17/IronPython+Post+20+Roadmap.aspx),
    we’re starting working on a production quality implementation of VS
    Integration for IPy.
-   Ophir Kra-Oz (aka Evil Fish) blogs [Python for
    Executives](http://ophir.wordpress.com/2008/07/20/python-for-executives/).
    I like his “Risk, Recruiting, Performance and Maturity” model – four
    boxes, perfect for keeping an executive’s attention!
    :smile:
    Plus Ophir has some nice things to say about IronPython. (via
    [Michael Foord](http://twitter.com/voidspace/statuses/863648598))
-   Ronnie Maor
    [blogs](http://www.ronnie-midnight-oil.net/2008/07/easier-python-evaluation-from-c.html)
    an [extension method for
    PythonEngine](http://www.ironpython.info/index.php/PythonEngineEvalExtension)
    to make Eval simpler. I especially like how he uses string format
    syntax so you can dynamically generate the code to eval. I wonder
    what this would look like in IPy 2.0 with DLR Hosting API. (via
    [IronPython
    URLs](http://ironpython-urls.blogspot.com/2008/07/easier-python-evaluation-from-c.html))
-   Speaking of DLR Hosting, Seshadri has [another great DLR hosting
    post](http://blogs.msdn.com/seshadripv/archive/2008/07/17/dlr-hosting-sample-write-event-handlers-for-vs-in-ironpython.aspx),
    this time hosting IPy inside of VS08 so you can script VS08 events
    (document saved, window created, etc) with Python.
-   Justin Etheredge has a bunch of IronRuby posts – [Getting IronRuby
    Up and
    Running](http://www.codethinked.com/post/2008/07/14/Getting-IronRuby-Up-and-Running.aspx),
    [Running Applications in
    IronRuby](http://www.codethinked.com/post/2008/07/17/Running-Applications-in-IronRuby.aspx),

-   Don Syme
    [links](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/07/19/f-and-arcgis-arcobjects.aspx)
    to several F\# related posts by [Ray
    Vernagus](http://vernagus.blogspot.com/), though he’s apparently
    also [experimenting with
    IronRuby](http://vernagus.blogspot.com/2007/10/extension-methods-and-ironruby.html).
    I’m really interested in his [Purely Functional Data
    Structures](http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521663504)
    port to F\#.
-   Speaking of F\#, Brian has a [teaser
    screenshot](http://lorgonblog.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!701679AD17B6D310!282.entry)
    of F\# upcoming CTP. However, he chooses the New Item dialog to
    tease, which looks pretty much like the current new item dialog (the
    new one does have fewer F\# templates). However, if you look in the
    Solution Explorer, you’ll notice a real “References” node. No more
    \#I/\#R! Yeah!
-   The interactive graphic in [Kevin Kelly’s One Machine
    article](http://www.wired.com/special_multimedia/2008/st_infoporn_1607)
    is fascinating. It really highlights that the vast vast vast
    majority of power, storage, CPU cycles and RAM come from personal
    computers on the edge. Even in bandwidth, where PC’s still have the
    highest share but it looks to be around 1/3rd, the aggregate of all
    edge devices (PCs, mobile phones, PDAs, etc.) still dominates the
    data centers.
