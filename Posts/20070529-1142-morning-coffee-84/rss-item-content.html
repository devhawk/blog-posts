<p>There appear to be several posts from several blogs that have spawned from my discussion about REST with David. I'll catch up on them and respond here in the next day or so. In the meantime...</p><ul><li>Saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449088/">PotC: At World's End</a> over the weekend, due to a fluke last minute babysitter availability. It's gotten <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/piratesofthecaribbeanatworldsend">mediocre reviews</a>, but I liked it. Not as much as the first two, but certainly better than Spiderman 3. June looks fairly bleak @ the box office. We'll <strike>probably</strike> take the kids to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423294/">Surf's Up</a> And <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/">Ratatouille</a>. (Remember back when there was only one kids movie per summer?) <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413099/">Evan Almighty</a> might be funny and I remember reading <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450385/">1408</a>, but I think they're both rentals. The only thing I'm otherwise remotely interested in is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134/">Sunshine</a>.</li><li>Speaking of storytelling, <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/lostandfound/index">Lost</a> and <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/">Heroes</a> wrapped their seasons last week. While early on, it looked like Heroes was going to be the new Lost, Lost's season finally was awesome. If you don't watch Lost, you're really missing out on the best show on TV right now. You have eight months to catch up before season four. Heroes may not be lost, but they're keeping the interest up with their <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/novels/">online comic book</a> plus while Lost <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070507/en_nm/lost_dc">scales back</a> to 16 episodes for each of three more seasons, Heroes is <a href="http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-nbcupfronts-heroesorigins,0,5536579.story">bulking up</a>, adding six "Heroes: Origins" and bringing the total to 30 for next season.</li><li>Larry O'Brien <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,c3dd478d-6129-487d-aebb-26c37e0e8f35.aspx">fantasizes</a> about his dream PDC. Aren't there lots of conferences about learning how to "create great applications" on and for the Microsoft/Windows Platform? What about TechEd? (which is where I'll be next week)</li><li>Sam Gentle <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/05/26/windows-workflow-104-or-wf-part-4.aspx">continues to dig</a> into WF, examining the various ways you can extend the WF runtime by replacing the persistence, loader and scheduler services. He's also taking <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/27/Morning+Coffee+34.aspx">my advice</a> to scrap ExternalDataService and work directly with the WorkflowQueuingService. </li><li>Steve Jones <a href="http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/2007/05/soa-and-swiss-railways-or-another.html">compares</a> SOA to trains and I don't get it. I mean, his advice on the value of batch processes makes sense, but his train/car analogy seems a bit strained, esp. when he calls the railway system "event based". Can't a car be "event based" too? There's just a much smaller number of people who care about a given car's events...</li><li>Ted Neward <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=240">debated OR/M</a> with Ayende on .NET Rocks. Based on <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/05/28/The+ORM+Smackdown.aspx">Ted's post</a>, the show must have been a doozy. Sounds like Ted took some controversial positions, including advocating OO databases. Of course, "shies away from <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx">controversy</a>" <u><em>isn't</em></u> how I would describe Ted.</li></ul>
