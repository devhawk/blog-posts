It&#8217;s gotten <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/film\/titles\/piratesofthecaribbeanatworldsend\">mediocre reviews<\/a>, but I liked it. Not as much as the first two, but certainly better than Spiderman 3. June looks fairly bleak @ the box office.

While early on, it looked like Heroes was going to be the new Lost, Lost&#8217;s season finally was awesome.\u00a0If you don&#8217;t watch Lost, you&#8217;re really missing\u00a0out on\u00a0the best show on TV right now. You have eight months to catch up before season four. Heroes may not be lost, but they&#8217;re keeping the interest up with their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbc.com\/Heroes\/novels\/\">online comic book<\/a>\u00a0plus while Lost <a href=\"http:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/s\/nm\/20070507\/en_nm\/lost_dc\">scales back<\/a> to 16 episodes for each of three more seasons, Heroes is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zap2it.com\/tv\/news\/zap-nbcupfronts-heroesorigins,0,5536579.story\">bulking up<\/a>, adding six &#8220;Heroes: Origins&#8221; and bringing the total to 30 for next season.<\/li>\n<li>Larry O&#8217;Brien <a href=\"http:\/\/www.knowing.net\/PermaLink,guid,c3dd478d-6129-487d-aebb-26c37e0e8f35.aspx\">fantasizes<\/a> about his dream PDC.

I mean, his advice on the value of batch processes makes sense, but his train\/car analogy seems a bit strained, esp. when he calls the railway system &#8220;event based&#8221;. Can&#8217;t a car be &#8220;event based&#8221; too?
