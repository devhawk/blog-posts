There appear to be several posts from several blogs that have spawned
from my discussion about REST with David. I’ll catch up on them and
respond here in the next day or so. In the meantime…

-   Saw [PotC: At World’s End](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449088/)
    over the weekend, due to a fluke last minute babysitter
    availability. It’s gotten [mediocre
    reviews](http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/piratesofthecaribbeanatworldsend),
    but I liked it. Not as much as the first two, but certainly better
    than Spiderman 3. June looks fairly bleak @ the box office. We’ll
    ~~probably~~ take the kids to see [Surf’s
    Up](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423294/) And
    [Ratatouille](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/). (Remember back
    when there was only one kids movie per summer?) [Evan
    Almighty](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413099/) might be funny and I
    remember reading [1408](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450385/), but I
    think they’re both rentals. The only thing I’m otherwise remotely
    interested in is [Sunshine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134/).
-   Speaking of storytelling,
    [Lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/lostandfound/index) and
    [Heroes](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/) wrapped their seasons last
    week. While early on, it looked like Heroes was going to be the new
    Lost, Lost’s season finally was awesome. If you don’t watch Lost,
    you’re really missing out on the best show on TV right now. You have
    eight months to catch up before season four. Heroes may not be lost,
    but they’re keeping the interest up with their [online comic
    book](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/novels/) plus while Lost [scales
    back](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070507/en_nm/lost_dc) to 16
    episodes for each of three more seasons, Heroes is [bulking
    up](http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-nbcupfronts-heroesorigins,0,5536579.story),
    adding six “Heroes: Origins” and bringing the total to 30 for next
    season.
-   Larry O’Brien
    [fantasizes](http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,c3dd478d-6129-487d-aebb-26c37e0e8f35.aspx)
    about his dream PDC. Aren’t there lots of conferences about learning
    how to “create great applications” on and for the Microsoft/Windows
    Platform? What about TechEd? (which is where I’ll be next week)
-   Sam Gentle [continues to
    dig](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/05/26/windows-workflow-104-or-wf-part-4.aspx)
    into WF, examining the various ways you can extend the WF runtime by
    replacing the persistence, loader and scheduler services. He’s also
    taking [my
    advice](http://devhawk.net/2007/02/27/Morning+Coffee+34.aspx) to
    scrap ExternalDataService and work directly with the
    WorkflowQueuingService.
-   Steve Jones
    [compares](http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/2007/05/soa-and-swiss-railways-or-another.html)
    SOA to trains and I don’t get it. I mean, his advice on the value of
    batch processes makes sense, but his train/car analogy seems a bit
    strained, esp. when he calls the railway system “event based”. Can’t
    a car be “event based” too? There’s just a much smaller number of
    people who care about a given car’s events…
-   Ted Neward [debated
    OR/M](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=240) with
    Ayende on .NET Rocks. Based on [Ted’s
    post](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/05/28/The+ORM+Smackdown.aspx),
    the show must have been a doozy. Sounds like Ted took some
    controversial positions, including advocating OO databases. Of
    course, “shies away from
    [controversy](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx)”
    *isn’t* how I would describe Ted.
