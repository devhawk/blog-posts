<p>1. You can customize how you load workflows. My favorite part of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/MSPress/books/6895.asp">Customizing the Microsoft® .NET Framework Common Language Runtime</a> is custom loading assemblies from a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/stg/stg/structured_storage_start_page.asp">structured storage</a> file. In WF, you can load workflows by <a href="http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ms594868.aspx">type</a> or <a href="http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ms594869.aspx">from XAML</a>. Of course, these the XAML - or even the types - can be loaded from anywhere, or even generated on the fly. If you need more control, you can swap out the <a href="http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/system.workflow.runtime.hosting.workflowloaderservice.aspx">default workflow loader service</a> with one of your own creation.</p><p>2. You can swap out the <a href="http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms735790.aspx">default workflow scheduler</a>. How about a scheduler based on the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/wiki/default.aspx/Channel9.ConcurrencyRuntime">Concurrency and Coordination Runtime (CCR)</a>?</p><blockquote><p>Side note - How about a official home page for CCR? And while I'm asking, how about a download for CCR separate from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/robotics/">MS Robotics Studio</a>?</p></blockquote><p>3. You can add any object to the workflow runtime as a service. You're not limited <a href="http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734738.aspx">the services the WF runtime knows</a> about. Of course, WF won't use your service, but you can build activities that use it. This is likely to be huge for getting data in and out of the workflow instance.</p>
