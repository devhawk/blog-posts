Last week, I ordered a couple of [my shirts from
Zazzle](http://devhawk.net/2006/02/16/Introducting+DevHawk+Designs.aspx)
and they arrived over the weekend. I got one each black and white and I
wore the black one to work today. I’m pretty impressed with the quality
of the shirts and the printing job.

Of course the coolest part was being asked where I got the shirt and
being able to reply “I made it”.

BTW, I met a couple of folks from Zazzle at Mashup Camp. They told me
about a couple things working that I’m not sure are public yet which is
why I left them out of my daily roundups. They told me the [304
shirts](http://devhawk.net/2006/02/17/First+TShirt+Sale.aspx) was
actually a kinda slow day.
