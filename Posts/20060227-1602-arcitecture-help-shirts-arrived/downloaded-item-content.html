<p>Last week, I ordered a couple of <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/16/Introducting+DevHawk+Designs.aspx">my shirts from Zazzle</a> and they arrived over the weekend. I got one each black and white and I wore the black one to work today. I&#8217;m pretty impressed with the quality of the shirts and the printing job. </p>
<p>Of course the coolest part was being asked where I got the shirt and being able to reply &#8220;I made it&#8221;. </p>
<p>BTW, I met a couple of folks from Zazzle at Mashup Camp. They told me about a couple things working that I&#8217;m not sure are public yet which is why I left them out of my daily roundups. They told me the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/17/First+TShirt+Sale.aspx">304 shirts</a> was actually a kinda slow day. </p>
