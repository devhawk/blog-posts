I met [John Crupi](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/crupi) – CTO of
Sun’s Enterprise Web Service Practice – at OOPSLA last year. Very cool
guy. I hadn’t realized he started blogging last month until [Steve
Vinoski](http://www.iona.com/blogs/vinoski/)[linked](http://www.iona.com/blogs/vinoski/archives/000153.html)
to him. There seems to be some disagreement regarding using a top-down
approach to SOA. Steve writes that SOA, like other “real-world
development” is usually a mix of top-down and bottom-up. John writes
that SOA is about a business driven architecture instead of an IT driven
architecture. I liked this

[John Evdemon](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon) made two
[points](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2004/12/17/323889.aspx) 
relevant to this issue several months ago:

> -   SOA does not enable or ensure the alignment of IT and business.
>     The IT industry has been promising this for decades – there is no
>     silver bullet for aligning IT and business. Alignment of IT and
>     business is an organizational issue that will not be resolved by
>     an architectural design philosophy alone.
>
> -   Service Orientation will happen in your organization in one of two
>     possible ways: chaotically (typical approach) or in a disciplined
>     manner. The path your organization takes (and the cost of later
>     fixing that path) is up to you.

I’m with John on this one. Traditional approaches to new problems are
rarely successful.
