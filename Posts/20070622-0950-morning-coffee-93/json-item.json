They only had the screaming eagle jersey for twelve years, and they swapped out the blue jersey for the black one (that started life as a third jersey) somewhere along the line.  <\/li>\n<li>Lawrence Lessig <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lessig.org\/blog\/archives\/003800.shtml\">hangs up<\/a> his IP spurs to go after the deep corruption of the political process. He points out that after a decade focusing on IP, he&#8217;s learned all he is going to about these issues so he decided (among other reasons) that it was time to start fresh learning about something new. I keep telling my kids that &#8220;always keep learning&#8221; is one of the secrets to life. This move by Lessig is the embodiment of that principle. Good for him.

Like <a href=\"http:\/\/ankhsvn.tigris.org\/\">AnkhSVN<\/a>, VisualSVN snaps into Visual Studio. However, where AnkhSVN is a native SVN implementation, VisualSVN depends on Tortoise. Scott Bellware <a href=\"http:\/\/codebetter.com\/blogs\/scott.bellware\/archive\/2006\/09\/02\/VisualSVN-_2D00_-Finally-Feel_2D00_Good-Visual-Studio-Plugin-for-Subversion.aspx\">wrote<\/a> &#8220;VisualSVN takes a novel approach to bringing SVN into the Visual Studio IDE&#8230; it brings Tortoise into the IDE!&#8221;.

I tend to be somewhat&#8230;how should I say it?&#8230;strong willed about the direction projects I work on should take. My current project is about driving a paradigm shift to service orientation, and I don&#8217;t think you can&#8217;t drive that kind of change without being somewhat strong willed. It&#8217;s a thin line between strong willed and asshole and hopefully I come down on the right side of that line more often than not. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Washington Capitals unveil their new jersey tonight, though they have a picture on their web site.
