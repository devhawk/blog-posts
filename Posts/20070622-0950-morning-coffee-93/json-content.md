    [unveil their new jersey](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/21/AR2007062102100.html)
    tonight, though they have a picture on their web site. I’ve got
    mixed feelings, though I’m trying to reserve judgement until I see
    it “in action”. I like that they’re back to the traditional Caps
    colors. But the Caps have jersey change fatigue. They only had the
    screaming eagle jersey for twelve years, and they swapped out the
    blue jersey for the black one (that started life as a third jersey)
    somewhere along the line.
-   Lawrence Lessig [hangs
    up](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003800.shtml) his IP spurs
    to go after the deep corruption of the political process. He points
    out that after a decade focusing on IP, he’s learned all he is going
    to about these issues so he decided (among other reasons) that it
    was time to start fresh learning about something new. I keep telling
    my kids that “always keep learning” is one of the secrets to life.
    This move by Lessig is the embodiment of that principle. Good for
    him. (via [John Lam](http://del.icio.us/drjflam#2007-06-20))
-   My old team keep chugging along. They’ve recently added “special
    coverage” sections on [Agile
    Development](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb404166)
    and [Enterprise
    Architecture](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb469938.aspx).

    [details](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Jun-21.html) the
    three week “hackathon” (his words, not mine) they went thru to get a
    working version of [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/) on
    [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com) – aka
    [Moonlight](http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight) – in time for
    ReMix 07 in Paris. It’s an impressive engineering achievement, to
    say the least. Also, it’s nice to see the folks from Microsoft
    France invite Miguel to come be a part of their keynote. (via [Larry

    in response to my question about SVN clients other than Tortoise.
    Like [AnkhSVN](http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/), VisualSVN snaps into
    Visual Studio. However, where AnkhSVN is a native SVN
    implementation, VisualSVN depends on Tortoise. Scott Bellware
    [wrote](http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/archive/2006/09/02/VisualSVN-_2D00_-Finally-Feel_2D00_Good-Visual-Studio-Plugin-for-Subversion.aspx)
    “VisualSVN takes a novel approach to bringing SVN into the Visual
    Studio IDE… it brings Tortoise into the IDE!”. So it still sounds
    like Tortoise is *the* SVN client everyone cares about.

    a variety of immature development and management methodologies,
    including Development By Denial (DBD), Cover Your Ass Engineering
    (CYAE) and my personal favorite Asshole Driven development (ADD).
    Scott Hanselman
    [suggests](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ADDAndFlamingPotatoDevelopment.aspx)
    looking around and making sure you’re not said asshole. I tend to be
    somewhat…how should I say it?…strong willed about the direction
    projects I work on should take. My current project is about driving
    a paradigm shift to service orientation, and I don’t think you can’t
    drive that kind of change without being somewhat strong willed. It’s
    a thin line between strong willed and asshole and hopefully I come
    down on the right side of that line more often than not.
