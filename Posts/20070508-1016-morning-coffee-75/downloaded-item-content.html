<li>3D Printing is going to be huge. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/technology/07copy.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">According to the NYT</a>, we&#8217;ll be looking at around $1,000 for one within four years.

<li>It&#8217;s <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/12/18/P2P+Revisited.aspx">been a while</a> since I experimented with the P2P stack in Windows, but it looks like it&#8217;s getting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/p2p/archive/2007/03/12/writing-peer-to-peer-applications-using-net-part-1-pnrp.aspx">the managed treatment</a> in VS &#8220;Orcas&#8221;. </li>
<li>The managed Ruby hits keep on coming. Last week was DLR and IronRuby. This week it&#8217;s a <a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/Ruby.NET/">new drop of Ruby.NET</a>&nbsp;which includes VS integration. </li>
<li>Looks like Sun is trying to get back&nbsp;into the Ajax/Flash/Silverlight fray with <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2007-05/sunflash.20070508.2.xml">JavaFX Script</a>. I wrote over a year ago that &#8220;<a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/04/Flash+The+Other+White+Meat.aspx">In platform portability, Flash has succeeded where Java failed</a>.&#8221; I can&#8217;t help but believe JavaFX is too little too late. Also, it&#8217;s yet another Java technology name that sounds like it&#8217;s been blatantly copied from MSFT. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC">JDBC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages">JSP</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Data_Objects">JDO</a>&nbsp;&#8230; What&#8217;s next?

<li>Steve Maine has a <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,163e2844-bc01-4f6c-b721-d432666ec966.aspx">great</a><a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,6a82e302-d81a-4494-91dc-f6d60b2d4190.aspx">series</a> of <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,40c0cf83-27b1-49e7-8086-c57d1b5007cd.aspx">posts</a> on the new Web Programming Model that&#8217;s coming in .NET 3.5 and is currently being previewed as part of the <a href="http://labs.biztalk.net/">BizTalk Services SDK</a>. But it was his <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,1d8eb9d5-2cac-4b6d-ba93-a6c40fab35e2.aspx">Balancing reach and rich</a>&nbsp;post that I found most illuminating. The first version of WCF feels hopelessly bound to the WS-* view of the world, which makes it difficult to incorporate alternative messaging models into the same programming model. I&#8217;ve run into this trying to use SSB with WCF. In the next version, that WCF / WS-* marriage looks like it&#8217;s getting a little more open. In my current role, I&#8217;m not so interested in the web programming model, but I am very interested in how they are integrating these alternative models.</li>
