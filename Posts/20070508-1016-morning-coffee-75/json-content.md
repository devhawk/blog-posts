-   3D Printing is going to be huge. [According to the
    NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/technology/07copy.html?_r=1&oref=slogin),
    we’ll be looking at around \$1,000 for one within four years. For
    the impatient, check out <Fab@Home> and build one *right now*.
-   It’s [been a
    while](http://devhawk.net/2003/12/18/P2P+Revisited.aspx) since I
    experimented with the P2P stack in Windows, but it looks like it’s
    getting [the managed
    treatment](http://blogs.msdn.com/p2p/archive/2007/03/12/writing-peer-to-peer-applications-using-net-part-1-pnrp.aspx)
    in VS “Orcas”.
-   The managed Ruby hits keep on coming. Last week was DLR and
    IronRuby. This week it’s a [new drop of
    Ruby.NET](http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/Ruby.NET/) which includes VS
    integration.
-   Looks like Sun is trying to get back into the Ajax/Flash/Silverlight
    fray with [JavaFX
    Script](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2007-05/sunflash.20070508.2.xml).
    I wrote over a year ago that “[In platform portability, Flash has
    succeeded where Java
    failed](http://devhawk.net/2006/02/04/Flash+The+Other+White+Meat.aspx).”
    I can’t help but believe JavaFX is too little too late. Also, it’s
    yet another Java technology name that sounds like it’s been
    blatantly copied from MSFT.
    [JDBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC),
    [JSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages),

    [great](http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,163e2844-bc01-4f6c-b721-d432666ec966.aspx)[series](http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,6a82e302-d81a-4494-91dc-f6d60b2d4190.aspx)
    of
    [posts](http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,40c0cf83-27b1-49e7-8086-c57d1b5007cd.aspx)
    on the new Web Programming Model that’s coming in .NET 3.5 and is
    currently being previewed as part of the [BizTalk Services
    SDK](http://labs.biztalk.net/). But it was his [Balancing reach and
    rich](http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,1d8eb9d5-2cac-4b6d-ba93-a6c40fab35e2.aspx) post
    that I found most illuminating. The first version of WCF feels
    hopelessly bound to the WS-\* view of the world, which makes it
    difficult to incorporate alternative messaging models into the same
    programming model. I’ve run into this trying to use SSB with WCF. In
    the next version, that WCF / WS-\* marriage looks like it’s getting
    a little more open. In my current role, I’m not so interested in the
    web programming model, but I am very interested in how they are
    integrating these alternative models.
