I wrote over a year ago that "<a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/04/Flash+The+Other+White+Meat.aspx">In platform portability, Flash has succeeded where Java failed</a>." I can't help but believe JavaFX is too little too late. Also, it's yet another Java technology name that sounds like it's been blatantly copied from MSFT. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC">JDBC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages">JSP</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Data_Objects">JDO</a> ...

The first version of WCF feels hopelessly bound to the WS-* view of the world, which makes it difficult to incorporate alternative messaging models into the same programming model. I've run into this trying to use SSB with WCF. In the next version, that WCF / WS-* marriage looks like it's getting a little more open. In my current role, I'm not so interested in the web programming model, but I am very interested in how they are integrating these alternative models.</li></ul>
