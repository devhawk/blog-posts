  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This "downright moron" as you call him scored higher on his SATs and IQ tests that the guy that lost.  How do you explain that?  Were this premise true the country would have elected the lesser intellect but we didn't.  A persons ability to speak elequently is not always an indicator of their intelligence.

Besides that, being smart isn't the only requirement for being a good President.  It might not even be the primary requirement.  Jimmy Carter was arguably the smartest President we've ever had but it would be very hard to argue that he was the best one.

Religion is not the elephant in the room.  People aren't supposed to talk about the proverbial "elephant in the room" but they certainly talked a lot about religion at the end of the Presidential race.  Even Kerry started pretending that it was important to him.  Despite what you might think, a very large percentage of this country still considers themselves religious and will likely keep voting Presidents that respect religious people.  The Dems as a party seem to think religion is for weak minded people then they wonder why these people they pity don't vote for them.  Hmmmmmm.]]></wp:comment_content>
