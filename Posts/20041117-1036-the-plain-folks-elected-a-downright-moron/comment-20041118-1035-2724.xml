  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I disagree with your point Baldrick about the TV eliminating the second or third had problem - I think it makes it much much worse. We elect a president based much more on what the candidates surrogates say - esp. in the case of the Repulicans since so much of the mass media today is conservative. Other than the debates, all we hear from the candidates directly are stump speechs and sound bites. 

As for solutions, I don't know. I certainly don't think socialism or denying anyone the right to vote is the right choice. Remember, I'm for election reform - I want EVERYONE to vote, even if they vote against the candidate I support.]]></wp:comment_content>
