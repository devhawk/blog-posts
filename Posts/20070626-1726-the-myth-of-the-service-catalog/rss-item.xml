  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Normally, I would simply note that Nick Malik had finally moved on from the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/19/not-crazy-just-lateral-thinking.aspx">Great Mort vs. Agile Debate<sup>tm</sup></a> in my next Morning Coffee post and be done with it. But man, his post on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/26/the-unimportant-soa-catalog.aspx">Unimportant SOA Catalog</a> is just too good to leave until then...</p><p>Nick has come around to the view that the catalog does "a really good job of solving the wrong problem". I agree 100%. I haven't talked about it much here, but my teammates could tell you I have been on a rampage about this internally. People think a service catalog will create adoption and reuse. That suggests that the big obstacle to service adoption and reuse is simply the issue of finding something to adopt or reuse. </p><p>It's not. </p><p>The next PM I meet who says "I wish I had a big catalog of services so I can search for something that I can take an external dependency on" will be the first. And they'll probably be wearing a straightjacket, because looking for dependencies on purpose like that is crazy talk. Project managers <em><u>avoid</u></em>external dependencies like the plague. So when a PM looks at a service catalog, what they see a big list of stuff they don't want to take a dependency on. Not exactly the mindset to stimulate reuse and adoption, is it?</p><p>Nick suggests that a catalog might work if it was small (20-50 services) but not for hundreds or thousands of services. I think it's a culture issue not a scale issue, so I don't think it would work even for a small number of services. But in the end, it's a moot point since he expects a large number of services. Different reasons, same conclusion. 'nuff said.</p><p>However, while I rail against wasting time building a service catalog that won't do what everyone thinks it will do, I haven't had a better idea.</p><p>Nick does. The Periodic Table of Services. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/26/the-unimportant-soa-catalog.aspx">Go read</a>. More of my thoughts on this later.</p>]]></content:encoded>
