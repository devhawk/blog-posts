<p>Normally, I would simply note that Nick Malik had finally moved on from the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/19/not-crazy-just-lateral-thinking.aspx">Great Mort vs. Agile Debate<sup>tm</sup></a> in my next Morning Coffee post and be done with it. But man, his post on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/26/the-unimportant-soa-catalog.aspx">Unimportant SOA Catalog</a> is just too good to leave until then&#8230;</p>
<p>Nick has come around to the view that the catalog does &#8220;a really good job of solving the wrong problem&#8221;. I agree 100%. I haven&#8217;t talked about it much here, but my teammates could tell you I have been on a rampage about this internally. People think a service catalog will create adoption and reuse. That suggests that the big obstacle to service adoption and reuse is simply the issue of finding something to adopt or reuse. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not. </p>
<p>The next PM I meet who says &#8220;I wish I had a big catalog of services so I can search for something that I can take an external dependency on&#8221; will be the first. And they&#8217;ll probably be wearing a straightjacket, because looking for dependencies on purpose like that is crazy talk. Project managers <em><u>avoid</u></em>external dependencies like the plague. So when a PM looks at a service catalog, what they see a big list of stuff they don&#8217;t want to take a dependency on. Not exactly the mindset to stimulate reuse and adoption, is it?</p>
<p>Nick suggests that a catalog might work if it was small (20-50 services) but not for hundreds or thousands of services. I think it&#8217;s a culture issue not a scale issue, so I don&#8217;t think it would work even for a small number of services. But in the end, it&#8217;s a moot point since he expects a large number of services. Different reasons, same conclusion. &#8217;nuff said.</p>
<p>However, while I rail against wasting time building a service catalog that won&#8217;t do what everyone thinks it will do, I haven&#8217;t had a better idea.</p>
