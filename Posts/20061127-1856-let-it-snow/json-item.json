Not much &#8211; less than an inch by my measurement &#8211; but enough to snarl traffic getting off campus. Jules and I decided it would make more sense for me to grab dinner in the campus cafe and wait out some of the crowds rather than brave the snow and traffic on a nearly empty tank of gas.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I don&#8217;t work on campus any more. My office is <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/09\/30\/quotWorkingquot+From+Home+As+The+Office+Moves.aspx\">way down in Issaquah<\/a>. Unluckily for me, I had a meeting on main campus today. It was a great meeting &#8211; talking about my project with some field architects. But I didn&#8217;t expect to get trapped on campus by snow or I would have blown it off. Next time, I need a meeting room with windows!<\/p>\n<p>Update &#8211; It took me only 45 minutes to get home, which is actually fairly typical for me to get home from main campus in the evening. There must have been an accident on 520 because when I crossed the freeway by campus, it was bumper-to-bumper as far as I could see in both directions. But when I passed the 520 exit by my house, there was only a trickle of cars coming off it. The side streets were surprisingly empty. Maybe everyone was afraid they&#8217;d be impassible with snow? Takes more than an inch of snow to stop me and my 4WD Chevy Blazer.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>My wife wanted snow, and main Microsoft campus got it.
