<p>In Febuary, <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/02/11/Morning+Coffee+145.aspx">when I said</a> &#8220;Romney&#8217;s a real douche bag&#8221;, <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,d88e8506-d669-41c3-a246-6da1865f9a2e.aspx#commentstart">several upset commenters</a> vowed never to read my blog again. I was even called a bigot (though <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/">Dale</a> jumped in and explained how wrong a charge that is). Frankly, anytime I run a political post, especially ones where I call prominent Republicans names, that&#8217;s the reaction I expect. </p>
<p>So it kinda surprised me that the <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,be8c3c37-012b-499f-a1d2-1db86c5771b5.aspx#commentstart">response</a> to <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/08/01/McCains+Dick+Move+Of+The+Week.aspx">calling McCain a dick and his campaign an embarrassment</a> was so tepid. No outrage. No promises to unsubscribe nor predictions that others would do likewise. Dale sounds like he agrees that McCain&#8217;s campaign is an embarrassment, even though he clearly supports McCain. RandyG doesn&#8217;t have anything to say about McCain one way or the other, but he thinks Obama is a &#8220;pompous dick&#8221;. Only BigJ provides any defense of McCain at all, but it&#8217;s an extremely weak defense. He described McCain as &#8220;not afraid to tick off a powerful, influential, big money contributor&#8221;, which I would expect is hard to say out loud with a straight face. Given that McCain <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/26/AR2008072601891_pf.html">has raked in millions in contributions from the oil industry</a> after flip-flopping on offshore drilling, describing the Hilton&#8217;s $4,600 contribution as &#8220;powerful, influential, big money&#8221; is laughable. Hell, McCain is returning <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/mccain-campaign-is-reviewing-donations/">ten times that amount</a> in &#8220;unusual&#8221; (read: possibly illegal) contributions because they &#8220;just didn&#8217;t sound right&#8221;. </p>
<p>I figure there are two main possible reasons for the lack of outrage:</p>
<ul>
<li>All my readers who are willing to unsubscribe because I don&#8217;t agree with their political view have already left, leaving only those who agree with or simply ignore my political posts.</li>
<li>The number of people willing to stand up and defend McCain, even anonymously in my small corner of the Internet, is very small.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I probably a little of both, but I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s more the latter than the former. </p>
