I was even called a bigot (though <a href=\"http:\/\/halfmybrain.spaces.live.com\/\">Dale<\/a> jumped in and explained how wrong a charge that is). Frankly, anytime I run a political post, especially ones where I call prominent Republicans names, that&#8217;s the reaction I expect. <\/p>\n<p>So it kinda surprised me that the <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/CommentView,guid,be8c3c37-012b-499f-a1d2-1db86c5771b5.aspx#commentstart\">response<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/08\/01\/McCains+Dick+Move+Of+The+Week.aspx\">calling McCain a dick and his campaign an embarrassment<\/a> was so tepid. No outrage. No promises to unsubscribe nor predictions that others would do likewise. Dale sounds like he agrees that McCain&#8217;s campaign is an embarrassment, even though he clearly supports McCain. RandyG doesn&#8217;t have anything to say about McCain one way or the other, but he thinks Obama is a &#8220;pompous dick&#8221;. Only BigJ provides any defense of McCain at all, but it&#8217;s an extremely weak defense. He described McCain as &#8220;not afraid to tick off a powerful, influential, big money contributor&#8221;, which I would expect is hard to say out loud with a straight face. Given that McCain <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2008\/07\/26\/AR2008072601891_pf.html\">has raked in millions in contributions from the oil industry<\/a> after flip-flopping on offshore drilling, describing the Hilton&#8217;s $4,600 contribution as &#8220;powerful, influential, big money&#8221; is laughable. Hell, McCain is returning <a href=\"http:\/\/thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com\/2008\/08\/07\/mccain-campaign-is-reviewing-donations\/\">ten times that amount<\/a> in &#8220;unusual&#8221; (read: possibly illegal) contributions because they &#8220;just didn\u2019t sound right&#8221;. <\/p>\n<p>I figure there are two main possible reasons for the lack of outrage:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>All my readers who are willing to unsubscribe because I don&#8217;t agree with their political view have already left, leaving only those who agree with or simply ignore my political posts.<\/li>\n<li>The number of people willing to stand up and defend McCain, even anonymously in my small corner of the Internet, is very small.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Personally, I probably a little of both, but I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s more the latter than the former. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In Febuary, when I said &#8220;Romney&#8217;s a real douche bag&#8221;, several upset commenters vowed never to read my blog again.
