  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ok, we can have some fun with this!  You're right, "powerful, influential, big money contributor" doesn't really sound right without the proper inflection.  Dittoheads would understand.  Reading long responses can be arduous so I was trying to be short and cute.

As for the post analysis, there is an additional possible reason for the lack of responses that you failed to mention.  No one cares what an Obama supporter thinks about politics, it’s likely to change when his handlers write the next speech anyway ;) haha.
