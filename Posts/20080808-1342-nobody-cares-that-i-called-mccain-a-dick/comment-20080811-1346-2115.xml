  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I wouldn't call McCain's whole campaign an embarrassment, simply agreeing that the commercial in question was in poor taste. In any case, I haven't decided for sure who I am voting for since neither candidate is close to what I would call a conservative. I will never unsubscribe just because you write something political. It is your blog after all, and I find your arguments well thought out even when I disagree with them.]]></wp:comment_content>
