Lee (Tommy)<\/span><br \/>Photo by Jay Koh<br \/>Property of Village Theatre<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Last night, I got to see the final dress rehearsal of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.villagetheatre.org\/mainstage_tommy07.shtml\">The Who&#8217;s TOMMY<\/a> at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.villagetheatre.org\">Village Theater<\/a> in Issaquah. My mother-in-law got a couple of free passes because she&#8217;s working with the director on a separate project. There was no way to get a babysitter on such short notice, so that meant either <a href=\"http:\/\/techiewife.spaces.msn.com\/\">Jules<\/a> or I got to go. She&#8217;s not as big a Who fan as I am plus the theater is five minutes from my office, so I got to go.  <\/p>\n<p>Most people who know the show have either heard the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rhapsody.com\/thewho\/tommy\">album<\/a>, seen the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0073812\/\">movie<\/a> or\u00a0both. Pete Townsend <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tommy_%28rock_opera%29#1993_stage_version\">adapted it for Broadway<\/a> in the early 90&#8242;s and I got to see it as it came through Washington DC on it&#8217;s way to New York. Suffice to say that the movie is <em>very<\/em> different from the stage show. It&#8217;s so different that the Village Theater <a href=\"http:\/\/www.villagetheatre.org\/Downloads\/mainstage\/prod-guides\/tommy-pg.doc\">specifically<\/a> &#8220;does not recommend the film for previewing to gain an understanding of the stage version.&#8221;  <\/p>\n<p>If I had to pick, I like movie version more than the stage version. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rhapsody.com\/petetownshend\/thewhostommy\">stage arrangement of the music<\/a> is orchestral, which I feels waters down the power of the music. This is most obvious on <a href=\"http:\/\/play.rhapsody.com\/thewho\/tommy\/eyesighttotheblindthehawker\">Eyesight to the Blind<\/a> which was performed in the movie by Eric Clapton. The <a href=\"http:\/\/play.rhapsody.com\/petetownshend\/thewhostommy\/eyesighttotheblindreprise\">orchestral arrangement<\/a> is barely recognizable as the same song in my opinion. The stage version also adds a new song &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/play.rhapsody.com\/petetownshend\/thewhostommy\/ibelievemyowneyes\">I Believe My Own Eyes<\/a> &#8211; which I don&#8217;t very much.  <\/p>\n<p>However, if you look at it on it&#8217;s own, The Who&#8217;s TOMMY is a good show. It&#8217;s over the top, but for this show that works. Tommy&#8217;s journey from &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewho.net\/discography\/songs\/PinballWizard.html\">deaf, dumb and blind kid<\/a>&#8221; to &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewho.net\/discography\/songs\/SallySimpson.html\">new Messiah<\/a>&#8221; is even more appropriate today than it was in 1993 when the Broadway version premiered. At the time, Townsend got a lot of flak for the changes the show, but as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewho.net\/articles\/townshen\/pt_96.htm\">he said<\/a> &#8220;what&#8217;s actually changed is the times&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>While the show itself is over the top, this production is even more so. To quote from the flyer (which I can&#8217;t find online) everything is in nearly constant motion. Actors, set pieces and a huge video screen that dominates the stage. Again, given the show, it works. The cast was good &#8211; Michael Lee (pictured above) as Tommy was a particular stand out. There were a few rough spots in the large chorus numbers, but that&#8217;s to be expected in a dress rehearsal, right?<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line, it&#8217;s a good show so if you live within driving distance of Issaquah, you should check it out. If you&#8217;re already Who fan, just be aware that it&#8217;s not supposed to be just like the movie&#8230;<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Michael K.
