I think we&#8217;re in pretty good shape, though we&#8217;ll see how we look tomorrow. One good piece of news is that <a href=\"http:\/\/spaces.msn.com\/members\/dickcarl\/\">Dick Carlson<\/a>, who manages the Hands-on Labs, sent out a list of labs either not received or that have blocking bugs. No ARC track labs on either list. That&#8217;s a good sign&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Last night was the track owner dinner at Sea World. Funny, we had a track owner dinner at Sea World last year in San Diego. Is this a trend? It was fun to hang out with the other track owners and drink rather than have to sit around a table and plan. Didn&#8217;t get to see Shamu up-close-and-personal like last year, but we did go ride the Kraken roller-coaster. Pretty cool, though reminiscent of Batman at Six Flags in SoCal. One slight bummer &#8211; some of us waited extra to ride in the front, but I was to big for those seats! And it wasn&#8217;t a weight problem (though I could certainly use some work on that front), it was a barrel chest problem. <\/p>\n<p>Today, my pal <a href=\"http:\/\/blahgkarma.blogspot.com\/\">Chris<\/a> is driving up from Hobe Sound and we&#8217;re going to hang out this afternoon. I used to see Chris all the time, but then we both switched jobs and he doesn&#8217;t have much chance to come out to the left coast. Last time I saw him was at an architect forum last spring in Orlando, when again he drove up to see me. However, I hear there may be a helicopter ride in the cards today, so I&#8217;ll try and keep the &#8220;when are you coming to see me for a change?&#8221; grief to a minimum.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve even gotten a chance to write up some thoughts on two new projects and to play around with the new DSL Toolkit CTP. Of course, having an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.valence.com\/ncharge2.asp\">extended battery<\/a> for the plane ride was the reason I could do all that.<\/p>\n<p>See you in the cabana on Monday&#8230;<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The calm before the storm, as they say&#8230; Things have been quiet around here between new baby &amp; final TechEd prep.
