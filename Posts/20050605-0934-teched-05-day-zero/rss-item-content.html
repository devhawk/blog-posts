<p>The calm before the storm, as they say...</p><p>Things have been quiet around here between new baby &amp; final TechEd prep. I think we're in pretty good shape, though we'll see how we look tomorrow. One good piece of news is that <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/dickcarl/">Dick Carlson</a>, who manages the Hands-on Labs, sent out a list of labs either not received or that have blocking bugs. No ARC track labs on either list. That's a good sign...</p><p>Last night was the track owner dinner at Sea World. Funny, we had a track owner dinner at Sea World last year in San Diego. Is this a trend? It was fun to hang out with the other track owners and drink rather than have to sit around a table and plan. Didn't get to see Shamu up-close-and-personal like last year, but we did go ride the Kraken roller-coaster. Pretty cool, though reminiscent of Batman at Six Flags in SoCal. One slight bummer - some of us waited extra to ride in the front, but I was to big for those seats! And it wasn't a weight problem (though I could certainly use some work on that front), it was a barrel chest problem. </p><p>Today, my pal <a href="http://blahgkarma.blogspot.com/">Chris</a> is driving up from Hobe Sound and we're going to hang out this afternoon. I used to see Chris all the time, but then we both switched jobs and he doesn't have much chance to come out to the left coast. Last time I saw him was at an architect forum last spring in Orlando, when again he drove up to see me. However, I hear there may be a helicopter ride in the cards today, so I'll try and keep the "when are you coming to see me for a change?" grief to a minimum.</p><p>I've even gotten a chance to write up some thoughts on two new projects and to play around with the new DSL Toolkit CTP. Of course, having an <a href="http://www.valence.com/ncharge2.asp">extended battery</a> for the plane ride was the reason I could do all that.</p><p>See you in the cabana on Monday...</p>
