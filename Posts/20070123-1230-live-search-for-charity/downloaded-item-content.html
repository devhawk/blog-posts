Use <a href="http://teamseattle.live.com/Search/Charity/TeamSeattle/Default.aspx"><u>teamseattle.live.com</u></a>&nbsp;to search and you help sponsor Children&#8217;s Hospital. Use <a href="http://click4thecause.live.com/"><u>click4thecause.live.com</u></a>&nbsp;to search and you help sponsor <a href="http://ninemillion.org/">Ninemillion.org</a>, which is working to help the&nbsp;9 million refugee children worldwide. </p>
<p>GIven that I&#8217;m already using Live Search, changing my default search page from Live.com to one of these two seems was a no brainer. I use the IE7 Search Box more often than not, so I also set up a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/searchguide/en-en/default.mspx">custom search provider</a>. However, that&#8217;s a bit of a PITA, so I took the <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/spec/1.1/description/">OpenSearch Description</a> XML files and hosted them here @ DevHawk. Click the links below to add them to IE7 search box. </p>
<ul>
<li>Add <a onclick='window.external.AddSearchProvider("http://devhawk.net/content/binary/Click4TheCause.xml");' href="#">Click4TheCause Charity Search</a>&nbsp;to your IE7 Search Box</li>
<li>Add <a onclick='window.external.AddSearchProvider("http://devhawk.net/content/binary/TeamSeattle.xml");' href="#">TeamSeattle Charity Search</a> to your IE7 Search Box</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a way to do this for Firefox&#8217;s search bar, but I have no idea how. If you &#8211; dear reader &#8211; know how to add search providers, please <a href="mailto:harry.pierson@microsoft.com">send me email</a> and I&#8217;ll update this post accordingly.</p>
