Sure has been quiet around here. Standard end of the fiscal year
craziness. Plus, I had some dogfood issue w/ XP SP2 RC1, Office 2003 SP1
beta and NewsGator. Upgrading to XP SP2 RC2 seems to have solved the
problem. Regardless of the cause, I’m way behind reading which in turn
leaves me way behind writing.

about how [VSTS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem) will
support software factories. He posted an excerpt from an article he’s
working on.
