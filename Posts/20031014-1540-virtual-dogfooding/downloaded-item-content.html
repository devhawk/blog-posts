<p>One of the cool things about using VPC to host my dev environment(s) is that I can easily dogfood and experiment. For example, I can run my VPC in &#8220;undo&#8221; mode so that when I shut down, I can choose to merge, keep or throw away all the changes I made to that VPC. This is a great safety net when dogfooding a bunch of different stuff. I&#8217;ve got a VPC with Whidbey and Indigo. Instead of creating a separate VPC for Yukon, I can install it into the Whidbey/Indigo VPC and see how well they play together. It does mean I have a long merge cycle when I shut down (assuming I don&#8217;t want to rollback the changes) and the VPC is runs slightly slower. But it&#8217;s a heck of a lot easier than finding out after the fact that build of this doesn&#8217;t work with this build of that.</p>
<p>Even for my &#8220;production&#8221; dev environments (I have two &#8211; client and server), I can make a back up of the entire system as easily as copying the multi-GB virtual hard drive file to a safe location. Of course, it helps that I have 1GB of RAM and nearly 85GB of HD space in my laptop.</p>
<p>The only downside is that actually dogfooding <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/virtualpc/">Virtual PC</a> is a bit of a pain. We have prebuilt XP and WS03 images available internally. But since I&#8217;m on a later build of VPC, the additions aren&#8217;t always compatible with my build. Our website lists &#8220;late in calendar year 2004&#8243; for the availability of Virtual PC 2004. So I guess there&#8217;s a light at the end of that dogfood tunnel.</p>
