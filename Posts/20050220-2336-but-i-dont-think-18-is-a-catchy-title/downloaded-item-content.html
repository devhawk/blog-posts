<p><a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/wabi-sabi/">Tanya</a> pointed out the other day that having a DVR causes you to watch a lot more TV. Case in point: <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a>. I missed the first three seasons. I never knew when it was on and once you miss a single episode, you&#8217;re kinda done. Now that I have a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/tv/content/Solutions/Foundation/MSTV_Foundation_Main.mspx">DVR</a>, I&#8217;ve haven&#8217;t missed any of season four. Furthermore, the first three seasons are available on DVD, so not only am I watching more TV from this season, I&#8217;m catching up on previous seasons. We just finished season one tonight.</p>
<p>[Note - there are some first season spoilers here - not big ones, but some nonetheless]</p>
<p>First off, there is alot of filler &#8211; at least in season one. There are long sequences (the girls escaping from the kidnappers leaps to mind) where there&#8217;s all this action and suspense, but everything ends up back where they started. Secondly, by the end&nbsp;I thought it was over the top on the amount of resources the bad guys had. I mean, they kidnap his daughter <em>again</em>? Maybe it bothered me more because I watched the whole season over a couple of weeks, instead of several months. Finally, the story flow really feels off &#8211; but that&#8217;s the nature of the real-time format. In a more typical series, there&#8217;s a slow build towards a final confrontation with a collection of connected yet distinct stories. But&nbsp;24 is like a single 24 hour long movie, except that it doesn&#8217;t have a clearly defined 3 act structure. It kust puts the pedal to the metal at around episode four and doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;let up. That&#8217;s not as exciting as it sounds &#8211; stuff just happens&#8230;and keeps happening. There&#8217;s no time for reflection or anticipation which makes it much more difficult to enjoy the story. </p>
<p>I realize part of the show&#8217;s gimick is that it&#8217;s a full 24 hours. But really, I think the story &#8211; at least season one&#8217;s story &#8211; would have been better told in 14-18 hours. Of course, that won&#8217;t stop me from watching the current season or starting in on season two.</p>
