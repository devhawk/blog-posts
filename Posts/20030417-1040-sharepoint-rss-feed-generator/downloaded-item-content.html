<p>I just added a project page for my <a href="prj_sharepointsynd.aspx">SharePoint RSS Feed Generator</a>. Please feel free to download and test the code. It&#8217;s very early code &#8211; v0.1 &#8211; and I know there are issues. It passed a basic smoke test with <a href="http://technovangelist.com/">Matt</a>, but he found some irregularities. He also suggested enabling RSS feed for individual lists rather than just for sites. That will be the primary enhancement of a v0.2.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s interest, I can create a <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/">GotDotNet Workspace</a> for this project.</p>
