After installing the new Windows Live Toolbar, I installed some of the
add-ins that I usually wouldn’t. Things like the Phishing Filter, Games
and the Windows Live Favorites. I’m not sure when Live Favorites was
refreshed, but the new version is much better. It support both folders
and tags – previously it just supported folders. There’s a reason why
tagging has taken off – it makes sense to people. I started using Live
Favorites but gave up because the folder approach is so much less
flexible.

The other new feature is that the Live Favorites Add-in now sync’s your
local favorites with your Live Favorites. Not sure how that will work if
you primarily use tags on Live Favorites, but I guess I’ll see.

Finally, Live Favorites can be shared, but there doesn’t appear to be
any way to search shared favorites. Am I missing something?
