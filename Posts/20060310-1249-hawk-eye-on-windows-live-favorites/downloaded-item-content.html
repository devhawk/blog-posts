<p>After installing the new&nbsp;Windows Live Toolbar, I installed some of the add-ins that I usually wouldn&#8217;t. Things like the Phishing Filter, Games and the Windows Live Favorites. I&#8217;m not sure when Live Favorites was refreshed, but the new version is much better. It support both folders and tags &#8211; previously it just supported folders. There&#8217;s a reason why tagging has taken off &#8211; it makes sense to people. I started using Live Favorites but gave up because the folder approach is so much less flexible. </p>
<p>The other new feature is that the Live Favorites Add-in now sync&#8217;s your local favorites with your Live Favorites. Not sure how that will work if you primarily use tags on Live Favorites, but I guess I&#8217;ll see. </p>
<p>Finally, Live Favorites can be shared, but there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any way to search shared favorites. Am I missing something?</p>
