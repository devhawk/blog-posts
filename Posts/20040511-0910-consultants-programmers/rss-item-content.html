<p>Not only in my blog back in action, but my gracious host Tom has started a <a href="http://conpro.net">blog</a> of his own. Since he hosts DevHawk for me, I added him to both my blog roll and to my navigation links.</p><p>Tom's <a href="http://www.conpro.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=815b303e-381b-4af9-a731-aae0c82267de">first post</a> (and the theme of his blog in general) is about the role of consultants and programmers in the future. He draws a nice parallel comparing how those roles are changing to how the chaufer role changed during the 20th century. </p>
