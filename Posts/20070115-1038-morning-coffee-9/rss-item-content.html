<p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up... live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr.">Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr</a></p><ul><li>My boss asks "<a href="http://rickbarn.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!F8796F31B57620E9!208.entry">Are We There Yet?</a>" on fulfilling Dr. King's dream. Sadly, the answer is no. I think we're making progress, but we're not "there" yet.</li><li>No <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270114003">back to back</a> trips to the Super Bowl for the Seahawks. They had chances to win it both down the stretch as well as in overtime and they couldn't capitalize. </li><li>I blogged about "Politics 2.0" <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/11/07/Certainly+Not+Politics+As+Usual.aspx">back on election day</a>. Here's an article about <a href="http://www.newpolitics.net/node/236">viral video in politics</a>Â that's very Politics 2.0. </li><li>It finally warmed up enough yesterday to make a snowman. Patrick named the snowman "Capa" which is what he call my father. Apparently, my father and the snowman have the same bushy eyebrows (according to my wife). It's supposed to snow again tonight, so maybe we can make a "Granny" or "Nana" snowman (snow-woman?).</li><li>The new season of <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a> started last night. Please review Larry's list of the <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,d7cfaac8-447a-4506-baeb-cd6171869539.aspx">Top 10 Things I've Learned About Computers From The Movies and Any Episode of '24'</a>. </li><li>My wife <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!623.entry">posted a picture</a> of Patrick and I playing <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/legostarwars2xbox360/">Lego Star Wars II</a>. We really enjoy it, but I need to watch my language when we play. When we were fighting the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/vivapinata">Rancor</a>, Patrick announced to his mommy that we were fighting the "big fucking monster". Woops! Patrick already knows several words that your not supposed to say (and he reminds us if we ever use them) so I guess should add that to the list. Or I could start saying <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/12/frack_1.html">frak</a> instead.</li></ul>
