I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up… live out the true
meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all
men are created equal.\

-   My boss asks “[Are We There
    Yet?](http://rickbarn.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!F8796F31B57620E9!208.entry)”
    on fulfilling Dr. King’s dream. Sadly, the answer is no. I think
    we’re making progress, but we’re not “there” yet.
-   No [back to
    back](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270114003) trips to
    the Super Bowl for the Seahawks. They had chances to win it both
    down the stretch as well as in overtime and they couldn’t
    capitalize.
-   I blogged about “Politics 2.0″ [back on election
    day](http://devhawk.net/2006/11/07/Certainly+Not+Politics+As+Usual.aspx).
    Here’s an article about [viral video in
    politics](http://www.newpolitics.net/node/236) that’s very Politics
    2.0.
-   It finally warmed up enough yesterday to make a snowman. Patrick
    named the snowman “Capa” which is what he call my father.
    Apparently, my father and the snowman have the same bushy eyebrows
    (according to my wife). It’s supposed to snow again tonight, so
    maybe we can make a “Granny” or “Nana” snowman (snow-woman?).
-   The new season of [24](http://www.fox.com/24/) started last night.
    Please review Larry’s list of the [Top 10 Things I’ve Learned About
    Computers From The Movies and Any Episode of
    ’24′](http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,d7cfaac8-447a-4506-baeb-cd6171869539.aspx).
-   My wife [posted a
    picture](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!623.entry)
    of Patrick and I playing [Lego Star Wars
    II](http://www.xbox.com/games/legostarwars2xbox360/). We really
    enjoy it, but I need to watch my language when we play. When we were
    fighting the [Rancor](http://www.xbox.com/games/vivapinata), Patrick
    announced to his mommy that we were fighting the “big fucking
    monster”. Woops! Patrick already knows several words that your not
    supposed to say (and he reminds us if we ever use them) so I guess
    should add that to the list. Or I could start saying
    [frak](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/12/frack_1.html)
    instead.
