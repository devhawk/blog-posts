<p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up&#8230; live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr.">Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr</a></p>

<li>My boss asks &#8220;<a href="http://rickbarn.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!F8796F31B57620E9!208.entry">Are We There Yet?</a>&#8221; on fulfilling Dr. King&#8217;s dream. Sadly, the answer is no. I think we&#8217;re making progress, but we&#8217;re not &#8220;there&#8221; yet.</li>
<li>No <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270114003">back to back</a> trips to the Super Bowl for the Seahawks. They had chances to win it both down the stretch as well as in overtime and they couldn&#8217;t capitalize. </li>
<li>I blogged about &#8220;Politics 2.0&#8243; <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/11/07/Certainly+Not+Politics+As+Usual.aspx">back on election day</a>. Here&#8217;s an article about <a href="http://www.newpolitics.net/node/236">viral video in politics</a>&nbsp;that&#8217;s very Politics 2.0. </li>
<li>It finally warmed up enough yesterday to make a snowman. Patrick named the snowman &#8220;Capa&#8221; which is what he call my father. Apparently, my father and the snowman have the same bushy eyebrows (according to my wife). It&#8217;s supposed to snow again tonight, so maybe we can make a &#8220;Granny&#8221; or &#8220;Nana&#8221; snowman (snow-woman?).</li>
<li>The new season of <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a> started last night. Please review Larry&#8217;s list of the <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,d7cfaac8-447a-4506-baeb-cd6171869539.aspx">Top 10 Things I&#8217;ve Learned About Computers From The Movies and Any Episode of &#8217;24&#8242;</a>. </li>
<li>My wife <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!623.entry">posted a picture</a> of Patrick and I playing <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/legostarwars2xbox360/">Lego Star Wars II</a>. We really enjoy it, but I need to watch my language when we play. When we were fighting the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/vivapinata">Rancor</a>, Patrick announced to his mommy that we were fighting the &#8220;big fucking monster&#8221;. Woops! Patrick already knows several words that your not supposed to say (and he reminds us if we ever use them) so I guess should add that to the list. Or I could start saying <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/12/frack_1.html">frak</a> instead.</li>
