  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Chris, we're in violent agreement. OO is the way to go inside the service and you KNOW I am a big fan of the .NET framework. Ram's opinion on abstraction levels was right on the money - I didn't reiterate since he did such a great job. Part of what I'm saying is that some OO ideas - i.e. the entity / control seperation - also work in an Service-Oriented (SO?) world. 

The problem is that many people still don't see the value of SO systems. Advocating an OO/SO balanced viewpoint over a pure OO one does sometimes look like OO hatemail. I didn't mean it to be. 

Hey, shouldn't you be writing this on a blog of your own? :)]]></wp:comment_content>
