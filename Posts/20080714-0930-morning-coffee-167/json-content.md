-   If you’re a gamer, you’re probably already well aware that [E3 is
    this week](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/e32008/). The
    [Too Human
    demo](http://majornelson.com/archive/2008/07/14/demo-too-human.aspx)
    has already been released. I have a friend who’s been working on
    “something” that will be announced today (I think).
-   Live Mesh folks [pushed out an
    update](http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/archive/2008/07/11/service-update-new-build-new-features-coming-today-0-9-3103-2.aspx)
    Friday. Among the new features is the ability to sync folders among
    peers but NOT up to the cloud. This is cool because it means I can
    sync my many many GB of pictures and music on my home machine backed
    up with Carbonite. This means I can sync them without blowing thru
    my 5GB Mesh storage limit.
-   It looks like there’s a new F\# drop –
    [1.9.4.19](http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/7ac148a7-149b-4056-aa06-1e6754efd36f/Details.aspx)
    – ~~but as usual there is no announcement or details as to what’s
    new. Release notes guys, look into it.~~  UPDATE – Don Syme [blogged
    the
    release](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/07/14/1-9-4-19-release.aspx),
    and it’s pretty minor. a .NET FX 3.5 SP1 bug fix, a fix for Mono,
    and they removed WebRequest.GetResponseAsync to make F\# work on
    Silverlight. And the release notes are in the readme. My bad.
-   Speaking of F\#, it was “partially inspired” by
    [OCaml](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml), so when I see papers
    related to OCaml, I immediately wonder if I an apply the described
    techniques to F\#. “[Catch me if you can, Towards type-safe,
    hierarchical, lightweight, polymorphic and efﬁcient error management
    in
    OCaml](http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Members/David.Teller/publications/ml2008.pdf)”
    is one such paper. (via
    [LtU](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2892))
-   Speaking of functional programming, Matthew Podwysocki
    [posted](http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/07/10/aspects-of-functional-programming-in-c-presentation-and-code.aspx)
    a bunch of FP links as well as a Code Gallery Sample [on FP in
    C\#.](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/FunctionalCSharp/) Good stuff.
-   As [per Scott
    Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/07/14/asp-net-mvc-preview-4-release-part-1.aspx),
    it looks like there’s a new ASP.NET MVC drop coming this week.
-   Based on posts by [Ted
    Neward](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/07/11/So+You+Say+You+Want+To+Kill+XML.aspx),
    [Dare
    Obasanjo](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/07/10/TheRevengeOfRPCGoogleProtocolBuffersAndFacebookThrift.aspx)
    and [Steve
    Vinoski](http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2008/07/11/protocol-buffers-no-big-deal/),
    Google [Protocol Buffers](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) sounds
    like it’s going to be a dud. Note, I haven’t looked at it depth
    personally, I’m just passing on opinions of some folks I read and
    trust.
-   Speaking of Dare, both
    [he](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/07/14/ProjectCassandraFacebooksOpenSourceAlternativeToGoogleBigTable.aspx)
    and [James
    Hamilton](http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2008/07/12/FacebookReleasesCassandraAsOpenSource.aspx)
    take a look at
    [Cassandra](http://code.google.com/p/the-cassandra-project/) and
    come away impressed. I wonder how easy it is to code against from
    Python and/or .NET?
-   Bart de Smet has a [cool
    sample](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2008/07/06/windows-powershell-through-ironruby-writing-a-custom-pshost.aspx)
    of calling out to PowerShell from IronRuby via the backtick command.
    Pretty cool, but it would even cooler to show how to call out to PS
    and return .NET objects to Ruby (though that would probably not be
    spec compliant for the backtick command).
-   Here’s a MS code name I had never heard before –
    [Zermatt](https://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=642).
    It’s “a framework for implementing claims-based identity in your
    applications.” (via [Steve
    Gilham](http://stevegilham.blogspot.com/2008/07/links-for-14-jul.html))
