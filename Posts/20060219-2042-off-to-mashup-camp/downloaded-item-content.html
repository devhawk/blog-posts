<p>In direct contrast with my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/03/No+Go+On+Developer+20.aspx">last trip to the Bay Area</a>, this one is going well so far. I&#8217;m in Mountain View for <a href="http://mashupcamp.com/">Mashup Camp</a>. The flight down was actually early and nearly empty &#8211; I had my side of the bulkhead row to myself. On the other side of the aisle was <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/biggs/blog/">Todd Biggs</a> from MSN, who was the one who <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=228548&SiteID=1http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=228548&SiteID=1">announced the availability</a> of <a href="https://buddyscript.conversagent.com/msnoffer.html">free tools</a> for building IM bots and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/messengerp2p/introduction.asp">MSN Messenger Activities</a> with <a href="http://www.conversagent.com/">Conversagent</a>. Long time readers of this blog might remember that I&#8217;ve been involved with <a href="http://devhawk.net/prj_messenger.aspx">programming to MSN Messenger</a> in the past, so it was great to spend some time with someone from the product (service?) team.</p>
<p>To top it off, Avis was out of normal cars, so I ended up with a red convertible Mustang. Yes, I can hear your pity coming my way now.</p>
<p>Of course, no trip is all early arrivals and convertibles. As my wife wrote a week ago, ours is the <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/techiewife/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!158.entry">House of Plague</a>. Everyone back home is still sick to some degree. And to top it off, today is Patrick&#8217;s birthday. We had his party yesterday morning, so really the celebration was all weekend, but it&#8217;s hard enough to be gone much less when my boy is turning three. </p>
