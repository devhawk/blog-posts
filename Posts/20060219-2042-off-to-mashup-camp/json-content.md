In direct contrast with my [last trip to the Bay
Area](http://devhawk.net/2006/02/03/No+Go+On+Developer+20.aspx), this
one is going well so far. I’m in Mountain View for [Mashup
Camp](http://mashupcamp.com/). The flight down was actually early and
nearly empty – I had my side of the bulkhead row to myself. On the other
side of the aisle was [Todd Biggs](http://spaces.msn.com/biggs/blog/)
from MSN, who was the one who [announced the
availability](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=228548&SiteID=1http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=228548&SiteID=1)
of [free tools](https://buddyscript.conversagent.com/msnoffer.html) for
building IM bots and [MSN Messenger
Activities](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/messengerp2p/introduction.asp)
with [Conversagent](http://www.conversagent.com/). Long time readers of
this blog might remember that I’ve been involved with [programming to
MSN Messenger](http://devhawk.net/prj_messenger.aspx) in the past, so it
was great to spend some time with someone from the product (service?)
team.

To top it off, Avis was out of normal cars, so I ended up with a red
convertible Mustang. Yes, I can hear your pity coming my way now.

Of course, no trip is all early arrivals and convertibles. As my wife
wrote a week ago, ours is the [House of
Plague](http://spaces.msn.com/techiewife/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!158.entry).
Everyone back home is still sick to some degree. And to top it off,
today is Patrick’s birthday. We had his party yesterday morning, so
really the celebration was all weekend, but it’s hard enough to be gone
much less when my boy is turning three.
