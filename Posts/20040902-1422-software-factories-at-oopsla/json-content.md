Keith [blogged](http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2004/09/01/224317.aspx)
about his hectic days since he returned from vacation. Getting a book
published, preparing for a BillG review, you know all the usual stuff.
:smile:

I keep waiting for my hardcopy of [Software
Factories](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471202843),
and Keith wrote that it should hit the shelves on Sept. 15th. This means
that it will be available in time for [OOPSLA
04](http://www.oopsla.org/2004). I’ve blogged this before, but it’s
worth repeating that there is going to be quite a MS presence at OOPSLA
this year:

-   [Dr. Rick
    Rashid](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/rick/default.asp)
    (director & founder of [MS
    Research](http://research.microsoft.com/)) on the [Future of
    Programming](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=801)
-   Jack Greenfield on [Software
    Factories](http://www.program-transformation.org/Gpce/JackGreenfieldOnSoftwareFactories)
    (part of the co-loed [GPCE conference](http://gpce04.gpce.org/))
-   Ward Cunningham on [Objects, Patterns, Wiki and eXtreme Programming:
    All Systems of
    Names](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=802)
-   Herb Sutter on [Concrete Languages on Virtual
    Platforms](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=804)
-   Steve McConnell on [Code Complete
    2](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=803) (Steve isn’t a
    ‘softie, but we do publish his book)
-   Full day tutorial on [Using Domain Specific Languages, Patterns,
    Frameworks and Tools to Assemble
    Applications](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=141) (i.e.
    Software Factories) by the authors of Software Factories
-   Half day tutorial on [Generative Software
    Development](http://www.program-transformation.org/Gpce/TutorialGP3)
    by Jack Greenfield and Krzysztof Czarnecki
-   Panel discussion on [MDA: The
    Realities](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=501) with
    Steve Cook and Granville Miller (among others)
-   Panel discussion on [The eXtreme Programming Customer: Fad or
    Fashion?](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=505) featuring
    Granville Miller (among others)
-   [The Great J2EE vs. .NET
    Shootout](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=503) panel
    discussion featuring [Don Box](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/)
    (MSFT Web Services Architect), Anders Hejlsberg (MSFT C\#
    Architect), Jon Crupi (Sun Java Archtiect), Rob High (IBM WebSphere
    Architect), [Alan
    Knight](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/knight/blogView) (Cincom VisualWorks
    architect) and chaired by [Martin
    Fowler](http://www.martinfowler.com/) (ThoughtWorks Chief Scientist)

You know I’m not going to miss all that. We’ll have coverage on
Architecture Center during the event and I will endeavor to get as much
of this content [Architecture
Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/) after the event. I
think the tutorials in particular will be very interesting to the
audience at large.

Anyone else going to OOPSLA?

**Update**: Added the three panel discussions. I’m guessing the [J2EE/.NET
shootout](http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=503) will be
standing room only.
