<p>It’s a small update, but I added support for displaying method arguments along side <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/03/31/Writing+An+IronPython+Debugger+Displaying+Values.aspx">the local variables</a>. As I mentioned in that post, breaking out the CorValue extraction and display code into a shared function was a good idea – adding support for getting arguments was trivial since I could reuse that code.</p><p>Because there’s no hierarchy of scopes to deal with and the names are in the metadata instead of debug symbols, getting arguments is much easier than getting local variables. </p><pre class="brush: python">
def get_arguments(frame): 
    mi = frame.GetMethodInfo() 
    for pi in mi.GetParameters(): 
      if pi.Position == 0: continue 
      arg = frame.GetArgument(pi.Position - 1) 
      yield pi.Name, arg
</pre><p>You’ll notice that I’m yielding the arguments as a tuple of the name and value, the same as get_locals yields. I did refactor <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/ipydbg/blob/4495bbcd48e9593dd3a148d0dafb82646cf091c0/ipydbg.py#L146">get_locals</a> a bit – there’s no longer an argument to skip hidden variables anymore (though get_locals still <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/03/25/Writing+An+IronPython+Debugger+Getting+Local+Variables.aspx">skips dynamic call sites caches</a> as it did before). Now, it’s up to the the caller of get_arguments and get_locals to filter hidden variables as they see fit. </p><p>Because get_locals and get_arguments yield the same types, I was able to factor the code to print a value and loop through the collection of values into separate local functions.</p><pre class="brush: python">

</pre><p>I really like the local functions feature of Python. In C#, you can define an anonymous delegate using the lambda syntax. But for a scenario like this, I like local functions better. However, I do like C#’s support for statement lambdas – Python only supports expression lambdas. So while I like local functions better in this scenario (because I’m using the method more than once) in something like an event handler, I like the statement lambda syntax better. </p><p>As usual, the <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/ipydbg/commit/4495bbcd48e9593dd3a148d0dafb82646cf091c0">latest version of ipydbg</a> is up on GitHub.</p>
