I said at both intermissions that the Caps were lucky to be tied\/down by only one, and the third period proved me right.

The Pens just beat the Flyers 5-4. I didn\u2019t see the whole game but Biron totally botched the play that lead to the Pens game winning goal. So we have the Pens riding a big win and the Caps coming off a lackluster performance on national TV. Should be interesting to say the least. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve got a morning flight home to Seattle tomorrow, so I\u2019m going to miss it.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>&#8220;We had nothing; we were horrible out there,&#8221; Boudreau snapped. &#8220;Everybody had their bad game at the same time.
