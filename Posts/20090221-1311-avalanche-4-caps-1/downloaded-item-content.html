<p>Boy, it&#8217;s much more fun to write a Caps wrapup <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/02/19/Caps+4+Canadians+3+SO.aspx">when they win</a>.</p>
<p>Honestly, the less said about this game, the better. I said at both intermissions that the Caps were lucky to be tied/down by only one, and the third period proved me right. Honestly, if I didn&#8217;t know the players and the teams, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to tell which team was #2 in the East and which team was #15 in the West. </p>
<p>The only good things I can say about this game are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perfect on the penalty kill, including 43 seconds of 5-on-3</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nhl.tv/team/console.jsp?hlg=20082009,2,871&event=WSH208">Backstrom&#8217;s goal</a> was nice</li>
<li>Much better on faceoffs &#8211; as a team, we won 60% of them. Only Nylander was below 50%. Steckel won 9 of 10</li>
<li>Err, did I mention the Caps were perfect on the PK?</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.japersrink.com/2009/2/20/766648/recap-avs-4-caps-1">Japers pointed out</a> that &#8220;the frequency with which these &#8220;efforts&#8221; are happening that is more than a little disconcerting.&#8221; After last night&#8217;s effort plus the 3rd period effort against Montreal, &#8220;more than a little disconcerting&#8221; is spot on.</p>
<p>Next up, Caps play the Penguins tomorrow. The Pens just beat the Flyers 5-4. I didn&#8217;t see the whole game but Biron totally botched the play that lead to the Pens game winning goal. So we have the Pens riding a big win and the Caps coming off a lackluster performance on national TV. Should be interesting to say the least. Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve got a morning flight home to Seattle tomorrow, so I&#8217;m going to miss it.</p>
