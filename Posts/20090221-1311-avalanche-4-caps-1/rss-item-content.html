<blockquote><p>"We had nothing; we were horrible out there," Boudreau snapped. "Everybody had their bad game at the same time. You win a lot of games in a row, you're going to have a stinker. Today was it."     <br /><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalsinsider/2009/02/avs_4_caps_1.html">Capitals Insider</a></p></blockquote><p>Boy, it’s much more fun to write a Caps wrapup <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/02/19/Caps+4+Canadians+3+SO.aspx">when they win</a>.</p><p>Honestly, the less said about this game, the better. I said at both intermissions that the Caps were lucky to be tied/down by only one, and the third period proved me right. Honestly, if I didn’t know the players and the teams, I wouldn’t have been able to tell which team was #2 in the East and which team was #15 in the West. </p><p>The only good things I can say about this game are:</p><ol><li>Perfect on the penalty kill, including 43 seconds of 5-on-3</li><li><a href="http://www.nhl.tv/team/console.jsp?hlg=20082009,2,871&amp;event=WSH208">Backstrom’s goal</a> was nice</li><li>Much better on faceoffs – as a team, we won 60% of them. Only Nylander was below 50%. Steckel won 9 of 10</li><li>Err, did I mention the Caps were perfect on the PK?</li></ol><p><a href="http://www.japersrink.com/2009/2/20/766648/recap-avs-4-caps-1">Japers pointed out</a> that “the frequency with which these "efforts" are happening that is more than a little disconcerting.” After last night’s effort plus the 3rd period effort against Montreal, “more than a little disconcerting” is spot on.</p><p>Next up, Caps play the Penguins tomorrow. The Pens just beat the Flyers 5-4. I didn’t see the whole game but Biron totally botched the play that lead to the Pens game winning goal. So we have the Pens riding a big win and the Caps coming off a lackluster performance on national TV. Should be interesting to say the least. Unfortunately, I’ve got a morning flight home to Seattle tomorrow, so I’m going to miss it.</p>
