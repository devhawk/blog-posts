<p>I’m just starting the third week in my new job – though between Thanksgiving and an intestinal virus, I’ve only been in my office for five days total so far. That’s not enough time to establish enough groundwork to be comfortable talking about what my team is doing yet. However, I just found out we’re still hiring and better yet there’s a public description of the job opening. So if you’ve ever thought “I want to work for Microsoft/Windows Division/With Harry”, here’s your chance! And if you aren’t looking for a new job, at least you can get some small hints as to what I’m doing in my new gig - “building substantial improvements into the Windows development platform” sounds interesting, doesn’t it?</p><blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?jid=9986">Senior Program Manager(708846 -External)</a></strong></p><p>Job Category: Software Engineering: Program Management     <br />Location: United States, WA, Redmond      <br />Job ID: 708846 9986      <br />Product: Windows  <br />Division: Windows Division</p><p>Developers!
