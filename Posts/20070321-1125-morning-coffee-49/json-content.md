-   The eBay Architecture SD Forum presentation that spawned the whole
    Transactionless meme is available
    [here](http://www.addsimplicity.com.nyud.net:8080/downloads/eBaySDForum2006-11-29.pdf).
    As I reported yesterday, it doesn’t call for going completely
    transactionless as Martin suggested. It calls for going without
    distributed transactions, which I agree with 100%.
-   More interesting than the transactional aspects, I found the data
    tier functional segmentation information facinating. Too bad those
    guys aren’t using our platform, SSB was expressly designed for
    exactly this sort of segmentation. I also liked that step 1 for
    “massively scaling J2EE” is to “throw out most of J2EE”.
-   After going mostly dark since last august, the manager of my old
    team [John deVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/) has been
    blogging up a storm since the beginning of March. So has my old boss
    [Mike
    Platt](http://michaelplatt.net/blogs/architecture/default.aspx). I
    wonder what happened at the begining of March? Here’s hoping this
    blogging fever spreads on my old team.

    “The bottom line is that ROI on SOA is an enterprise challenge, not
    an IT challenge.” Truer words are rarely spoken.
-   The rumor mill on the [Black Xbox 360
    “Elite”](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2007/03/20/zephyr-xbox-360-rumors-correct-coming-late-april/)
    are coming fast and furious. I don’t care about the HDMI port (my
    HDTV is five years old and doesn’t have one) but I would like a
    bigger hard drive…
