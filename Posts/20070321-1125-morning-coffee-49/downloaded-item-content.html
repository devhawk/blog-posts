<li>The eBay Architecture SD Forum presentation that spawned the whole Transactionless meme is available <a href="http://www.addsimplicity.com.nyud.net:8080/downloads/eBaySDForum2006-11-29.pdf">here</a>. As I reported yesterday, it doesn&#8217;t call for going completely transactionless as Martin suggested. It calls for going without distributed transactions, which I agree with 100%. </li>
<li>More interesting than the transactional aspects, I found the data tier functional segmentation information facinating. Too bad those guys aren&#8217;t using our platform, SSB was expressly designed for exactly this sort of segmentation. I also liked that step 1 for &#8220;massively scaling J2EE&#8221; is to &#8220;throw out most of J2EE&#8221;.</li>
<li>After going mostly dark since last august, the manager of my old team <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John deVadoss</a> has been blogging up a storm since the beginning of March. So has my old boss <a href="http://michaelplatt.net/blogs/architecture/default.aspx">Mike Platt</a>. I wonder what happened at the begining of March? Here&#8217;s hoping this blogging fever spreads on my old team.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=835">Joe McKendrick</a>: &#8220;The bottom line is that ROI on SOA is an enterprise challenge, not an IT challenge.&#8221; Truer words are rarely spoken.</li>
<li>The rumor mill on the <a href="http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2007/03/20/zephyr-xbox-360-rumors-correct-coming-late-april/">Black Xbox 360 &#8220;Elite&#8221;</a> are coming fast and furious. I don&#8217;t care about the HDMI port (my HDTV is five years old and doesn&#8217;t have one) but I would like a bigger hard drive&#8230;</li>
