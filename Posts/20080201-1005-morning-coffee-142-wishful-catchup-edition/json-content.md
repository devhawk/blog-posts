-   After spending most of the last four days away from my desk, I was
    planning on a quiet day to catch up on a variety of things. Then I
    heard the oh-so-minor news that [Microsoft is offering to buy
    Yahoo](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-01CorpNewsPR.mspx)
    for almost \$45 billion. Hasn’t been much reaction on the dev,
    architecture, politics and hockey-oriented blogs I read, but you can
    get a [ton of
    reactions](http://www.techmeme.com/080201/p26#a080201p26) on
    TechMeme.
-   [Lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost) is back. Finally. I stayed
    up late last night reading [Lostpedia](http://www.lostpedia.com/),
    catching up on [Lost Missing
    Pieces](http://lostmobisodes.blogspot.com/) and the [Find 815
    ARG](http://www.find815.com/).
-   Alex The Great had four goals and an assist in [last night’s
    victory](http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=773&season=20072008&gameType=2).
    Coughing up three goal lead and letting the Canadiens tie the game
    in the last 30 seconds isn’t encouraging, but a win is a win. The
    Caps are currently one game behind the SE leading Hurricanes and two
    games behind the current eight seed Rangers. Alex was named [first
    star for
    January](http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=352005).
-   Ted Neward has a nice summary of Lang.NET by day:
    [one](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/29/Highlights+Of+The+LangNET+Symposium+Day+One.aspx),
    [two](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/30/Highlights+Of+The+LangNET+Symposium+Day+Two.aspx)
    and
    [three](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/31/Highlights+Of+The+LangNET+Symposium+Day+Three+From+Memory.aspx).
    I wonder if my talk qualifies for the exception to Ted’s rule that
    “A blog is not a part of your presentation, and your presentation is
    not part of your blog”. I had 15 minutes to discuss something I’ve
    written about over [ten
    posts](http://devhawk.net/2007/12/10/Practical+Parsing+In+F.aspx) 
    (so far).

    [points](http://www.iunknown.com/2008/01/latest-dlr-host.html) to
    the latest [DLR hosting
    spec](http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.pdf).
    I’m much more interested in the DLR code generator, but at least the
    hosting interface is documented.
-   Scott Hanselman has a [nice
    post](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/226341924/TheWeeklySourceCode14FluentInterfaceEdition.aspx)
    on fluent interfaces. Note to self, find out if [Beautiful
    Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) works with
    [IronPython](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython).
-   I wonder if the [VS Source Code Outliner
    PowerToy](http://www.codeplex.com/SourceCodeOutliner) works with
    F\#? (via [Sam
    Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2008/01/27/new-and-notable-219.aspx))
-   Chris Tavares has an extensive post [Deconstructing
    ObjectBuilder?](http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/post/Deconstructing-ObjectBuilder---What-Is-ObjectBuilder.aspx)
    I’ve poked around inside OB before, but I’m really looking forward
    to
    [Unity](http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/01/14/diab-is-now-unity.aspx)
    (also via [Sam
    Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2008/01/27/new-and-notable-219.aspx))
-   NVIDIA *finally* updated the drivers for the video card in my Tecra
    M4. That only took a year.
