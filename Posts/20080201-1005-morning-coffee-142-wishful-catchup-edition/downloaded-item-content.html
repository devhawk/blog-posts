<li>After spending most of the last four days away from my desk, I was planning on a quiet day to catch up on a variety of things. Then I heard the oh-so-minor news that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-01CorpNewsPR.mspx">Microsoft is offering to buy Yahoo</a> for almost $45 billion. Hasn&#8217;t been much reaction on the dev, architecture, politics and hockey-oriented blogs I read, but you can get a <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080201/p26#a080201p26">ton of reactions</a> on TechMeme.  </li>
<li><a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost">Lost</a> is back. Finally. I stayed up late last night reading <a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/">Lostpedia</a>, catching up on <a href="http://lostmobisodes.blogspot.com/">Lost Missing Pieces</a> and the <a href="http://www.find815.com/">Find 815 ARG</a>.  </li>
<li>Alex The Great had four goals and an assist in <a href="http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=773&season=20072008&gameType=2">last night&#8217;s victory</a>. Coughing up three goal lead and letting the Canadiens tie the game in the last 30 seconds isn&#8217;t encouraging, but a win is a win. The Caps are currently one game behind the SE leading Hurricanes and two games behind the current eight seed Rangers. Alex was named <a href="http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=352005">first star for January</a>. </li>
<li>Ted Neward has a nice summary of Lang.NET by day: <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/29/Highlights+Of+The+LangNET+Symposium+Day+One.aspx">one</a>, <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/30/Highlights+Of+The+LangNET+Symposium+Day+Two.aspx">two</a> and <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/31/Highlights+Of+The+LangNET+Symposium+Day+Three+From+Memory.aspx">three</a>. I wonder if my talk qualifies for the exception to Ted&#8217;s rule that &#8220;A blog is not a part of your presentation, and your presentation is not part of your blog&#8221;. I had 15 minutes to discuss something I&#8217;ve written about over <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/10/Practical+Parsing+In+F.aspx">ten posts</a>&nbsp; (so far). </li>
<li>John Lam <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/01/latest-dlr-host.html">points</a> to the latest <a href="http://compilerlab.members.winisp.net/dlr-spec-hosting.pdf">DLR hosting spec</a>. I&#8217;m much more interested in the DLR code generator, but at least the hosting interface is documented.  </li>
<li>Scott Hanselman has a <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/226341924/TheWeeklySourceCode14FluentInterfaceEdition.aspx">nice post</a> on fluent interfaces. Note to self, find out if <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> works with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython">IronPython</a>. </li>
<li>I wonder if the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SourceCodeOutliner">VS Source Code Outliner PowerToy</a> works with F#? (via <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2008/01/27/new-and-notable-219.aspx">Sam Gentile</a>) </li>
<li>Chris Tavares has an extensive post <a href="http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/post/Deconstructing-ObjectBuilder---What-Is-ObjectBuilder.aspx">Deconstructing ObjectBuilder?</a> I&#8217;ve poked around inside OB before, but I&#8217;m really looking forward to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2008/01/14/diab-is-now-unity.aspx">Unity</a> (also via <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2008/01/27/new-and-notable-219.aspx">Sam Gentile</a>) </li>
<li>NVIDIA <em>finally</em> updated the drivers for the video card in my Tecra M4. That only took a year.</li>
