Then I heard the oh-so-minor news that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/press\/2008\/feb08\/02-01CorpNewsPR.mspx\">Microsoft is offering to buy Yahoo<\/a> for almost $45 billion. Hasn&#8217;t been much reaction on the dev, architecture, politics and hockey-oriented blogs I read, but you can get a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techmeme.com\/080201\/p26#a080201p26\">ton of reactions<\/a> on TechMeme.  <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/abc.go.com\/primetime\/lost\">Lost<\/a> is back. Finally. I stayed up late last night reading <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lostpedia.com\/\">Lostpedia<\/a>, catching up on <a href=\"http:\/\/lostmobisodes.blogspot.com\/\">Lost Missing Pieces<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.find815.com\/\">Find 815 ARG<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Alex The Great had four goals and an assist in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhl.com\/nhl\/app?service=page&amp;page=Recap&amp;gameNumber=773&amp;season=20072008&amp;gameType=2\">last night&#8217;s victory<\/a>. Coughing up three goal lead and letting the Canadiens tie the game in the last 30 seconds isn&#8217;t encouraging, but a win is a win. The Caps are currently one game behind the SE leading Hurricanes and two games behind the current eight seed Rangers.

I wonder if my talk qualifies for the exception to Ted&#8217;s rule that &#8220;A blog is not a part of your presentation, and your presentation is not part of your blog&#8221;. I had 15 minutes to discuss something I&#8217;ve written about over <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/12\/10\/Practical+Parsing+In+F.aspx\">ten posts<\/a>\u00a0 (so far). <\/li>\n<li>John Lam <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iunknown.com\/2008\/01\/latest-dlr-host.html\">points<\/a> to the latest <a href=\"http:\/\/compilerlab.members.winisp.net\/dlr-spec-hosting.pdf\">DLR hosting spec<\/a>.
