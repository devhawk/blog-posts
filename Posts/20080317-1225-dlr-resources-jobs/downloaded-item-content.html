<p>I&#8217;m back home from PyCon, but between digging out my inbox, finishing transition reports and doing my mid-year career discussion I&#8217;m a little busy. But I did want to point at a couple of recent posts from the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ironpython/">IPy team blog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ironpython/archive/2008/03/16/dlr-resources.aspx">DLR Resources</a> is a partial list of links to blogs (where&#8217;s mine?), mailing lists, specs, whitepapers and websites related to DLR, IronRuby and IronPython. I especially want to call out <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/">Dynamic Silverlight</a> which not only has lots of good information but also looks frakking sweet. Props to my so-to-be teammate <a href="http://jimmy.schementi.com/blog/">Jimmy Schementi</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ironpython/archive/2008/02/25/ironpython-ironruby-and-f-openings-in-dev-test-and-pm.aspx">Dev and Test Job Openings on IronPython, IronRuby &amp; F#</a>. We&#8217;re hiring, so if you&#8217;re interested in working on language development @ MSFT, <a href="mailto://harry@devhawk.net">drop me a line</a> and I&#8217;ll make sure it gets to the right people. BTW, I hear the IronPython PM position <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/03/11/Joining+The+Dynamic+Languages+Team.aspx">has been filled</a>. </li>
