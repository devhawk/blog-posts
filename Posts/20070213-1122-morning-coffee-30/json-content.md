    that the [CodeHTMLer WLWriter
    plugin](http://puzzleware.net/download.aspx?file=/codehtmler/codehtmler.livewriterplugin.zip) does
    support using the convert whitespace option. The Dialog UI is awful,
    but if you select “Edit Languages” from the dropdown in the plugin
    UI, you can set the UsePreTag option to false. While it is an ugly
    UI (sorry, Wes) it does allow you a lot of control over how the
    languages render. Not only can you change the settings for an
    existing language, you can add your own custom language if you want.

    Taglocity into Terazen Technology Inc. Not sure why Terazen is
    located in Vancouver, but maybe next time hops the pond for a visit
    to his new company’s headquarters, he might take a detour a few
    hours south and ramble on about architecture with a few old friends.
-   My excitement about the new season of 24 is waning quickly. Last
    night’s two hours episode had so many “oh, come on!” moments that it
    overwhelmed my ability to suspend belief.
-   If you want to dig in the [Connected Services
    Sandbox](http://www.networkmashups.com/), start with [this
    description](http://www.networkmashups.com/Mashup.aspx). I just saw
    this on [Larkware this
    morning](http://www.larkware.com/dg7/TheDailyGrind1077.aspx), so I
    haven’t had time to dig personally, but it does appear related to
    the [Connected Services
    Framework](http://www.microsoft.com/serviceproviders/solutions/connectedservicesframework.mspx).
    And apparently there’s a contest starting in a few weeks.
