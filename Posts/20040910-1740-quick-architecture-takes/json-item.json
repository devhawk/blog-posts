TechEd <a href=\"http:\/\/www.teched.com.my\/\">Malaysia<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/china\/teched\/default.asp\">Bejing<\/a>\u00a0are next week and I&#8217;m presenting at both, plus I&#8217;m stopping over in Tokyo to meet with the local field architects. Should be pretty cool. I did TechEd Malaysia two years ago, but I&#8217;ve never been to China before so I&#8217;m pretty excited.<\/p>\n<p>A few short takes before I go:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three more Architecture Strategy team members are blogging: Josh Less, Norman Guadagno and Drew Gude. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/finservguy\">Josh<\/a> is the &#8220;FinServGuy&#8221;, focusing on the architecture, patterns and standards in the financial services industry. He just started on our team and just started his blog. Go check out his post on the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/finservguy\/archive\/2004\/09\/10\/227897.aspx\">Insurance Value Chain<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/atlasbrandview.blogspot.com\/\">Norman<\/a> actually not a team member yet and he&#8217;s the blogging vet of these three. When he starts in October, Norman will be our marketing manager, a skill set that we&#8217;ve been sorely missing around here. His blog &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/atlasbrandview.blogspot.com\/\">Atlas Brand View<\/a> &#8211; has no coverage of architecture per se, but interesting marketing tidbits like <a href=\"http:\/\/atlasbrandview.blogspot.com\/2004\/05\/eight-reasons-marketing-makes-sense.html\">Eight Reasons Marketing Makes Sense<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/atlasbrandview.blogspot.com\/2004\/05\/whatever-happened-to-burger-king.html\">Whatever Happened To Burger King<\/a>. Can&#8217;t wait to see what he writes about architecture marketing.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/drewg\">Drew<\/a> is a vertical architect like Josh, but focused on automotive and manufacturing. He&#8217;s doing some cool work with RFID and is a member of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.frontlinetoday.com\/frontline\/article\/articleDetail.jsp?id=113816\">RosettaNet Architecture Advisory Committee<\/a>. However, as I write this, Drew has yet to blog anything. I keep hearing how he&#8217;s working on something but since I&#8217;m going out of town I figured I could put a bit of a squeeze to get him to post. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group433\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m stoked about the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dotnetlanguages.net\/DNL\/Default.aspx\">.NET Languages<\/a> site. Not much up there yet, but I subscribed. Given my interest in software factories and domain-specific languages, I guess this isn&#8217;t a surprise. But my interest in language design goes <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=896fcfbd-dede-4c62-8f59-24aece862218\">way back<\/a> to the early days of my blog. BTW, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/0130622966\/netlanguag-20\">Compiling for the .NET CLR<\/a> is a great book.<\/li>\n<li>I hung out with new-red-pill-taker <a href=\"http:\/\/www.peterprovost.org\/\">Peter Provost<\/a> last weekend. Our families went to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bumbershoot.com\/\">Bumbershoot<\/a> together. With my 18 month old son and Peter&#8217;s 30 month old daughter, there was little, if any, debauchery &#8211; unless riding the kiddy rollercoaster when you&#8217;re not really tall enough counts.\u00a0 There was, however, lots of geek talk, at least when the wifes were off doing other things.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got some cool stuff &#8220;in the works&#8221; which I hope to talk about more when I get back. I have 35 hours on airplanes in the next ten days, so I get a chance to bang out some code.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>It&#8217;s been quiet around here as I&#8217;m prepping for my next trip abroad.
