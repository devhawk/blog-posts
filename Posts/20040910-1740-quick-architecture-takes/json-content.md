It’s been quiet around here as I’m prepping for my next trip abroad.
TechEd [Malaysia](http://www.teched.com.my/) and
[Bejing](http://www.microsoft.com/china/teched/default.asp) are next
week and I’m presenting at both, plus I’m stopping over in Tokyo to meet
with the local field architects. Should be pretty cool. I did TechEd
Malaysia two years ago, but I’ve never been to China before so I’m
pretty excited.

A few short takes before I go:

-   Three more Architecture Strategy team members are blogging: Josh
    Less, Norman Guadagno and Drew Gude.
    -   [Josh](http://blogs.msdn.com/finservguy) is the “FinServGuy”,
        focusing on the architecture, patterns and standards in the
        financial services industry. He just started on our team and
        just started his blog. Go check out his post on the [Insurance
        Value
        Chain](http://blogs.msdn.com/finservguy/archive/2004/09/10/227897.aspx).
    -   [Norman](http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/) actually not a
        team member yet and he’s the blogging vet of these three. When
        he starts in October, Norman will be our marketing manager, a
        skill set that we’ve been sorely missing around here. His blog –
        [Atlas Brand View](http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/) – has no
        coverage of architecture per se, but interesting marketing
        tidbits like [Eight Reasons Marketing Makes
        Sense](http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/2004/05/eight-reasons-marketing-makes-sense.html)
        and [Whatever Happened To Burger
        King](http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/2004/05/whatever-happened-to-burger-king.html).
        Can’t wait to see what he writes about architecture marketing.
    -   [Drew](http://blogs.msdn.com/drewg) is a vertical architect like
        Josh, but focused on automotive and manufacturing. He’s doing
        some cool work with RFID and is a member of the [RosettaNet
        Architecture Advisory
        Committee](http://www.frontlinetoday.com/frontline/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=113816).
        However, as I write this, Drew has yet to blog anything. I keep
        hearing how he’s working on something but since I’m going out of
        town I figured I could put a bit of a squeeze to get him to
        post.

-   I’m stoked about the [.NET
    Languages](http://www.dotnetlanguages.net/DNL/Default.aspx) site.
    Not much up there yet, but I subscribed. Given my interest in
    software factories and domain-specific languages, I guess this isn’t
    a surprise. But my interest in language design goes [way
    back](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=896fcfbd-dede-4c62-8f59-24aece862218)
    to the early days of my blog. BTW, [Compiling for the .NET
    CLR](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130622966/netlanguag-20)
    is a great book.
-   I hung out with new-red-pill-taker [Peter
    Provost](http://www.peterprovost.org/) last weekend. Our families
    went to [Bumbershoot](http://www.bumbershoot.com/) together. With my
    18 month old son and Peter’s 30 month old daughter, there was
    little, if any, debauchery – unless riding the kiddy rollercoaster
    when you’re not really tall enough counts.  There was, however, lots
    of geek talk, at least when the wifes were off doing other things.

I’ve got some cool stuff “in the works” which I hope to talk about more
when I get back. I have 35 hours on airplanes in the next ten days, so I
get a chance to bang out some code.
