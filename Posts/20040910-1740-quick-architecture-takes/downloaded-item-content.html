<p>It&#8217;s been quiet around here as I&#8217;m prepping for my next trip abroad. TechEd <a href="http://www.teched.com.my/">Malaysia</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/china/teched/default.asp">Bejing</a>&nbsp;are next week and I&#8217;m presenting at both, plus I&#8217;m stopping over in Tokyo to meet with the local field architects. Should be pretty cool. I did TechEd Malaysia two years ago, but I&#8217;ve never been to China before so I&#8217;m pretty excited.</p>
<p>A few short takes before I go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three more Architecture Strategy team members are blogging: Josh Less, Norman Guadagno and Drew Gude. <p></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/finservguy">Josh</a> is the &#8220;FinServGuy&#8221;, focusing on the architecture, patterns and standards in the financial services industry. He just started on our team and just started his blog. Go check out his post on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/finservguy/archive/2004/09/10/227897.aspx">Insurance Value Chain</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/">Norman</a> actually not a team member yet and he&#8217;s the blogging vet of these three. When he starts in October, Norman will be our marketing manager, a skill set that we&#8217;ve been sorely missing around here. His blog &#8211; <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/">Atlas Brand View</a> &#8211; has no coverage of architecture per se, but interesting marketing tidbits like <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/2004/05/eight-reasons-marketing-makes-sense.html">Eight Reasons Marketing Makes Sense</a> and <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/2004/05/whatever-happened-to-burger-king.html">Whatever Happened To Burger King</a>. Can&#8217;t wait to see what he writes about architecture marketing.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drewg">Drew</a> is a vertical architect like Josh, but focused on automotive and manufacturing. He&#8217;s doing some cool work with RFID and is a member of the <a href="http://www.frontlinetoday.com/frontline/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=113816">RosettaNet Architecture Advisory Committee</a>. However, as I write this, Drew has yet to blog anything. I keep hearing how he&#8217;s working on something but since I&#8217;m going out of town I figured I could put a bit of a squeeze to get him to post. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group433" alt=":)"> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I&#8217;m stoked about the <a href="http://www.dotnetlanguages.net/DNL/Default.aspx">.NET Languages</a> site. Not much up there yet, but I subscribed. Given my interest in software factories and domain-specific languages, I guess this isn&#8217;t a surprise. But my interest in language design goes <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=896fcfbd-dede-4c62-8f59-24aece862218">way back</a> to the early days of my blog. BTW, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130622966/netlanguag-20">Compiling for the .NET CLR</a> is a great book.</li>
<li>I hung out with new-red-pill-taker <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/">Peter Provost</a> last weekend. Our families went to <a href="http://www.bumbershoot.com/">Bumbershoot</a> together. With my 18 month old son and Peter&#8217;s 30 month old daughter, there was little, if any, debauchery &#8211; unless riding the kiddy rollercoaster when you&#8217;re not really tall enough counts.&nbsp; There was, however, lots of geek talk, at least when the wifes were off doing other things.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve got some cool stuff &#8220;in the works&#8221; which I hope to talk about more when I get back. I have 35 hours on airplanes in the next ten days, so I get a chance to bang out some code.</p>
