<p>After reading <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog">Sam&#8217;s</a><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1674.html">slides on Atom</a>, Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/12/15.html#a5763">posted</a><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/12/15.html#a5764">three</a><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/12/15.html#a5767">times</a> about how syndication could evolve. Of course, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011">Scoble</a> has his <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn">Longhorn</a>-colored glasses on. <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/">Dare</a><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=75f21b33-fae8-4817-8710-085b3eaec9b9">pointed out</a> that &#8220;The major problems with syndication today have little to do with&nbsp;the syndication format and more to do with it&#8217;s associated technologies.&#8221; I agree with Dare. IMO, the only thing that the ATOM syndication format has over RSS is a namespace declaration. I care about that because one of the &#8220;associated technologies&#8221; I care about is SOAP and the lack of an RSS namespace makes it hard to embed an RSS item inside a SOAP message.</p>
<p>I think Scoble should be asking how syndication will evolve in the face of Service Oriented Architecture in general, not Longhorn specifically. Granted, Indigo is going to make Longhorn a great platform for SOA. (If you check out the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/understanding/books/migrationguide/">Longhorn Interoperability and Migration Guide</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnlongmig/html/intmiglongch02.asp">Chapter 2</a> is mostly dedicated to describing SOA.) But I think the real change to syndication is going to come from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/wsrmspecindex.asp">WS-ReliableMessaging</a>. In order to truly evolve syndication, I think we need to break free of the synchronous polling model we have today. Polling only works in scenarios with a central syndication source (like a weblog). However, as the sources of syndicated content get to be more distributed (phones, P2P networks, etc) that polling model breaks down. I need to be able to send messages when things change without regard to network availability. With WS-RM, I can send messages and the infrastructure (i.e. Indigo) can take care of the ugly details of making sure the messages get delivered to their final destination. </p>
