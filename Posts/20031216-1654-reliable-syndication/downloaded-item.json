IMO, the only thing that the ATOM syndication format has over RSS is a namespace declaration. I care about that because one of the &#8220;associated technologies&#8221; I care about is SOAP and the lack of an RSS namespace makes it hard to embed an RSS item inside a SOAP message.<\/p>\n<p>I think Scoble should be asking how syndication will evolve in the face of Service Oriented Architecture in general, not Longhorn specifically. Granted, Indigo is going to make Longhorn a great platform for SOA. (If you check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/longhorn\/understanding\/books\/migrationguide\/\">Longhorn Interoperability and Migration Guide<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/dnlongmig\/html\/intmiglongch02.asp\">Chapter 2<\/a> is mostly dedicated to describing SOA.) But I think the real change to syndication is going to come from <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/webservices\/understanding\/specs\/default.aspx?pull=\/library\/en-us\/dnglobspec\/html\/wsrmspecindex.asp\">WS-ReliableMessaging<\/a>. In order to truly evolve syndication, I think we need to break free of the synchronous polling model we have today. Polling only works in scenarios with a central syndication source (like a weblog). However, as the sources of syndicated content get to be more distributed (phones, P2P networks, etc) that polling model breaks down. I need to be able to send messages when things change without regard to network availability. With WS-RM, I can send messages and the infrastructure (i.e. Indigo) can take care of the ugly details of making sure the messages get delivered to their final destination. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>After reading Sam&#8217;sslides on Atom, Scoble postedthreetimes about how syndication could evolve.
