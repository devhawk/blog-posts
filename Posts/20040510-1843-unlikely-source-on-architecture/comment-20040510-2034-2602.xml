As you know coming from a country where soccer is the national sport. Jorge Valdano (http://www.makeateam.com.mx/index.php?c=11) an argentine soccer player in the 80's and 90's was the player in the spainard league playing for the Real Madrid, after he was done as a player he became the General Manager for the Real Madrid, is in this team that he wrote a book "Liderazgo" (http://www.lsf.com.ar/libros/7/950511862.asp). His idea is to see the enterprise as a soccer team and how to make the members of the team to work in a way that all the abilities of the team member are used to be maximun, and how to get new players in the areas that are needed.

Jorge Valdano was very successful with this book that many companies in Europe and Latin american took his teachings and incorporated into their workplace with success.
