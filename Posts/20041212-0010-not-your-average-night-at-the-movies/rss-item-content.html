<p>Tonight, we went to see my mother-in-law's new movie <a href="http://nwfilmforum.org/telephonepole/">Telephone Pole Numbering System</a> at the <a href="http://nwfilmforum.org/">Northwest Film Forum</a>. My wife and her mother are both actors. Julie was a child actor (she was in some of the old James Garner Polaroid commercials) and her mom was on Days of our Lives back in the 70s. I have always had a passion for movies and spent significant time back when I lived in LA writing bad screenplays (not bad on purpose of course). This movie was mostly OK - it had some very funny bits but also long stretches that were uninteresting and seemingly unrelated to the plot. Luckily, all the parts with my mother in law fell under the "funny bits" category. </p><p>While it was cool to see a family member on the big screen, I am really interested in getting more involved with the NWFF. The organization is a not-for-profit film arts organization that includes a <a href="http://www.nwfilmforum.org/calendar/">two-screen cinema</a> in downtown Seattle, <a href="http://www.nwfilmforum.org/wigglyworld/">production facilities for rent</a>, <a href="http://www.nwfilmforum.org/wigglyworld/workshops.shtml">workshops and classes</a> plus a <a href="http://www.thefilmcompany.org/">non-profit film studio</a> (which produced Telephone Pole Numbering System). In many ways, this is like community theater, but for movie making. I got to chat briefly with the film's director Bill Weiss, but Patrick was up past his bed time so I'll need to make time for a longer chat with these folks soon. </p><p>If you could make a movie, what would it be? For me, if we're talking pie-in-the-sky, no-real-world-constraints, it would be "Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League" hands down. (Laugh while you can, monkey boy)</p><p>Favorite Line from Telephone Pole Numbering System:</p><blockquote><p>"If I was a tree, I'd want to be a telephone pole" <br />"You're too short" </p></blockquote>
