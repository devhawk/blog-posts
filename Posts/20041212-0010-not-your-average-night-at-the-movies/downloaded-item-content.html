<p>Tonight, we went to see my mother-in-law&#8217;s new movie <a href="http://nwfilmforum.org/telephonepole/">Telephone Pole Numbering System</a> at the <a href="http://nwfilmforum.org/">Northwest Film Forum</a>. My wife and her mother are both actors. Julie was a child actor (she was in some of the old James Garner Polaroid commercials) and her mom was on Days of our Lives back in the 70s. I have always had a passion for movies and spent significant time back when I lived in LA writing bad screenplays (not bad on purpose of course). This movie was mostly OK &#8211; it had some very funny bits but also long stretches that were uninteresting and seemingly unrelated to the plot. Luckily, all the parts with my mother in law fell under the &#8220;funny bits&#8221; category. </p>
<p>While it was cool to see a family member on the big screen, I am really interested in getting more involved with the NWFF. The organization is a not-for-profit film arts organization that includes a <a href="http://www.nwfilmforum.org/calendar/">two-screen cinema</a> in downtown Seattle, <a href="http://www.nwfilmforum.org/wigglyworld/">production facilities for rent</a>, <a href="http://www.nwfilmforum.org/wigglyworld/workshops.shtml">workshops and classes</a> plus a <a href="http://www.thefilmcompany.org/">non-profit film studio</a> (which produced Telephone Pole Numbering System). In many ways, this is like community theater, but for movie making. I got to chat briefly with the film&#8217;s director Bill Weiss, but Patrick was up past his bed time so I&#8217;ll need to make time for a longer chat with these folks soon. </p>
<p>If you could make a movie, what would it be? For me, if we&#8217;re talking pie-in-the-sky, no-real-world-constraints, it would be &#8220;Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League&#8221; hands down. (Laugh while you can, monkey boy)</p>
<p>Favorite Line from Telephone Pole Numbering System:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If I was a tree, I&#8217;d want to be a telephone pole&#8221; <br>&#8220;You&#8217;re too short&#8221; </p>
