Between helping ship IronPython 2.0 and helping manage the languages and tools PDC08 track, I\u2019ve been swimming in the deep end of the pool all year.

Also major props to the DLR team, who are releasing the final 0.9 version of the DLR later today in concert with IPy 2.0. (Update: the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/dlr\/Release\/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=20378\">DLR 0.9 RTW bits<\/a> are now available) And of course, HUGE HUGE HUGE thanks to the vibrant IPy community, many of whom are listed by name in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/IronPython\/Wiki\/View.aspx?title=v2.0.0%20Release%20Notes&amp;referringTitle=Home\">the release notes<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Even with 2.0 finally out the door, there\u2019s no rest for the dynamic. As per the release notes, \u201cwe\u2019re planning on releasing IronPython 2.0.1 fairly soon\u201d so keep those bug reports coming. Going forward, we\u2019ve got big plans for IronPython and we rely heavily on the continued input from our community, so please keep telling us where we can improve.<\/p>\n<p>On a personal note, the past nine months have been busy \u2013 very busy \u2013 but they\u2019ve also been a blast. Frankly, I was hesitant about joining the product groups for a long time because I was worried about the grind, the culture, the overall experience. Turns out my fears were overblown, though I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s at least partially related to the fact that I work on a \u201clittle\u201d project like IronPython rather than a huge project like Visual Studio. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>This is a very pretty sight.
