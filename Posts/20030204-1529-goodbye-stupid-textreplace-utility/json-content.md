As expected, someone pointed out a simple utility to handle my
command-line search and replace needs:
[gsar](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsar.htm) – General
Search And Replace utility. It does what I need it to do quite nicely.
It doesn’t allow for regular expression searches, but I don’t need that
anyway. So my TextReplace utility is officially scraped. Thanks to Mike
Gunderloy @ [Larkware](http://www.larkware.com/) (previously RSS
subscribed).
