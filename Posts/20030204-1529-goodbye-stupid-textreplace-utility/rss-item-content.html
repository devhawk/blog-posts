As expected, someone pointed out a simple utility to handle my command-line search and replace needs: <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsar.htm">gsar</a> - General Search And Replace utility. It does what I need it to do quite nicely. It doesn't allow for regular expression searches, but I don't need that anyway. So my TextReplace utility is officially scraped.
