Of course, there are <a href=\"http:\/\/pdcbloggers.net\">plenty who did<\/a>, so I&#8217;ll just add a few thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who came to the Architecture Symposium. Sorry the logistics got so screwed up. In retrospect, I&#8217;d say the last minute decision to move us to a smaller room in order to accommodate an Avalon session repeat was a very bad one. We tried to guess what the attendance would be. You all really blew away our expectations. I guess there&#8217;s a lot of interest in architecture! I hope this means that you can expect more architecture themed content (driven by our team) at future MSFT conferences. The slides from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gotdotnet.com\/team\/PDC\/4284\/ARCSYM1.ppt\">Pat and David<\/a>&#8216;s talk as well as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gotdotnet.com\/team\/PDC\/4286\/ARCSYM3.ppt\"> Keith<\/a>&#8216;s are available online. We&#8217;ll get streaming media &amp; transcripts on the architecture as soon as possible, but not until after next week. If you liked Keith&#8217;s talk as much as I did, check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/vstudio\/productinfo\/enterprise\/default.aspx?pull=\/library\/en-us\/dnvsent\/html\/vsent_modelinglangs.asp\"> Modeling Languages for Distributed Applications<\/a> whitepaper that&#8217;s up on the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/vstudio\/productinfo\/enterprise\/default.aspx?pull=\/library\/en-us\/dnvsent\/html\/vsent_modelinglangs.asp\"> VS.NET Home for the Enterprise Customer<\/a>, which was launched @ PDC.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few other random thoughts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Favorite Quote: &#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for blogging, I&#8217;d be very lonely.

Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t trust Longhorn to be stable enough to house my data just yet. What&#8217;s the point of developing for Longhorn now if you&#8217;re not going to use the big three pillars: Avalon\/WinFS\/Indigo?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To top off the craziness of this past week, my team is having our big event &#8211; the Strategic Architects Forum &#8211; in Redmond next week. That means another week of 12 hour plus days. At least this time I get to sleep in my own bed each night.
