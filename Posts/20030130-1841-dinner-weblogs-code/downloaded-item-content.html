<p>Training for 8 work days + pregnant wife = much less time for blogging. But I did make it out to <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog">Sam Ruby</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1166.html">Weblog Gathering</a>. Full list of attendee&#8217;s is available at <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00000825.html">Anita Rowland&#8217;s weblog</a> (no RSS feed <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_sad.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group13" alt=":(">  ). Had a great time.</p>
<p>Highlight for me was meeting <a href="http://primates.helixcode.com/~miguel/activity-log.php">Miguel de Icaza</a> of the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono</a> project. He showed of Mono on his laptop plus took the time to explain why they chose the licenses they did. But the coolest part was first meeting him. When I realized who he was, I introduced myself and expressed how impressed I was regarding Mono&#8217;s progress. His response: &#8220;You guys have built a great platform.&#8221; I wish all interactions between commercial &amp; non-commercial software advocates could be so respectful. (no flames please &#8211; I realize my employer has been equally at fault for not being respectful. Hopefully, we&#8217;re <a href="http://news.com.com/2008-1082-981508.html">changing that</a>.)</p>
