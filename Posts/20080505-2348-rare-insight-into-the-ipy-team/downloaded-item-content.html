<p>Wow, am I really that loud? <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)">  </p>
<p>This is a response to the idea that no design is complete until you can&#8217;t remove anything else without sacrificing the overall goals of the end result.&nbsp; Is the pinky really necessary?&nbsp; We can &#8220;cut that feature&#8221;, right? <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"> </p>

<p>If you cut off the pinkie, then the ring finger becomes the pinkie and so iteratively you will have to lose all of them :). If I remember right in Europe, you hold up the pinkie to order beer. So it&#8217;s quite important <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"> </p>

<p>Well I find it hard to argue with ordering beer, but I doubt the pinkie&#8217;s original use was to order beer.&nbsp; Therefore I&#8217;d describe this as an abuse of an existing API that might be better served by a new API specifically designed for this purpose.&nbsp; But I question even if a new API is necessary.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Drinking beer by definition involves a container in which the beer is consumed from.&nbsp; Therefore the container it&#8217;s self (or the lack thereof) might be able to serve the dual role for both consuming the beer and indicating the need for a refill.&nbsp; For example when drinking sake I&#8217;ve been told it is customary to tip the bottle on its side to indicate the desire for a refill.&nbsp; Are we really to expect that the Human API exposes every need in a direct fashion?&nbsp; For example should I have another appendage for &#8220;I need more bread sticks&#8221; and yet another for &#8220;Can I get a refill or on the water?&#8221;.&nbsp; I&#8217;d propose the &#8220;2 creams no sugar&#8221; appendage because that&#8217;s the way I take my coffee.  </p>
<p>On the other hand the iterative problem does seem to be more relevant &#8211; but it presupposes a purpose for the pinky in the first place!&nbsp; But alas, I admit I&#8217;ve just returned from drinking beer, so this may not be the best argument :).</p>

<p>The pinkie is like a reserved field/custom field in a API. Every user community can come up with its own use for it but they have to devise the protocol themselves. Apparently different civilizations have. Wikipedia as usual has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_finger#Cultural_significance">list of those</a>. So do you get your &#8220;2 creams no sugar&#8221; appendage &#8211; sure if u can agree on the semantics with the waiter. Seems like a PM call to me <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group1143" alt=":)"> </p>
<p>PS: What beer did u have? I should try that &#8211; seems effective <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"> </p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t quite considered it like this but I&#8217;d propose an alternate encoding &#8211; binary.&nbsp; With 4 fingers one can communicate up to 16 different which seems to cover most of the listed issues.&nbsp; Yes 5 gives you up to 32 messages but 16 should be enough for everyone :). </p>
<p>And they were various Hale&#8217;s Ales fresh from the brewery.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t want to hold up 0010 really (although it won&#8217;t be the middle finger anymore) <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"> </p>

<p>Ahh, but let&#8217;s just call that one reserved &#8211; that leaves the end-user with 15 other messages!&nbsp; Personally I&#8217;d suggest we reserve the entire bit &#8211; that way we could use other codes like 1010 for future expansion of various standard messages.&nbsp; Urination seems popular on the pinky list so maybe we&#8217;d want to standardize that in the future &#8211; we of course need to look at uses of the other fingers before we come to this conclusion.&nbsp; Users are now left with 8 user-defined messages but that seems plenty.&nbsp; Also they can then use 1000 or 0001 (depending their endianness, a.k.a. left-handed or right-handed) for the now deprecated pinky-messages.</p>

<p>1000, 1100, 1110 and 1111 are actually used for counting numbers 1,2,3,4 <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)">  They are too obvious to be non-standardized. So they are out as well.  </p>
<p>That cuts the user messages to 5 (third bit is reserved anyway). Some of the ones left are hard to make as well &#8211; try 0101 <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"> </p>
