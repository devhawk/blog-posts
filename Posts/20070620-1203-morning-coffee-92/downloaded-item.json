I&#8217;m loving the dual monitor support, though I have a somewhat strange setup.\u00a0I keep my\u00a0primary monitor rotated in portrait mode, which is great for reading and writing. I typically use my second monitor for blogs and mail.\u00a0I even wrote a custom multi-mon wallpaper utility so I could easily generate new wallpapers for my non-standard monitor layout, including bitmap rotate support. If there&#8217;s interest, I can post it.

I completely agree with his hypothesis that short changing design may save time in the short term but will cost much more in the long term. However, the problem is that the people who are making the tradeoff &#8211; i.e. the people paying for the project NOT the people building the project &#8211; either don&#8217;t understand the tradeoff or are more than happy to sacrifice the long term cost for the short term gain. How are most projects measured? Being on time and on budget with the planned set of features. Very few projects &#8211; and none that I&#8217;ve ever seen &#8211; are goaled on long term maintainability. Until you can change that, this issue will continue to linger. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Brad Wilson blogs about SvnBridge, a tool that lets you use Subversion clients like TortoiseSVN to talk to Team Foundation Server.
