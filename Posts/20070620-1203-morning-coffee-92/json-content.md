    about [SvnBridge](http://www.codeplex.com/SvnBridge), a tool that
    lets you use Subversion clients like
    [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/) to talk to [Team Foundation
    Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718825.aspx).
    While I think that’s cool, I wonder is anyone interested in
    subversion clients *other* than TortoiseSVN? For example, will
    people choose [AnkhSVN](http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/) instead of the
    [Team Explorer
    Client](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181304(VS.80).aspx)?
-   Speaking of TortoiseSVN, I wonder if those guys are interested in
    building a TortoiseTFS project? I did find two other TFS shell
    extensions projects: [Dubbelbock
    TFS](http://blog.benday.com/archive/2007/05/18/23006.aspx) and
    [Turtle](http://www.codeplex.com/Turtle), though neither appears as
    full featured as Tortoise.

    [details](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/06/20/vs-2008-multi-targeting-support.aspx)
    VS08′s multi-targeting support. Of course, the three versions of the
    .NET Framework VS08 can target all use the same underlying runtime,
    which probably made it easier to build.

    [refactors](http://michaelplatt.net/blogs/architecture/archive/2007/06/18/service-oriented-programming-sop-tenets.aspx) Don
    Box’s original [tenets of service
    orientation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/01/Indigo/default.aspx)
    so he can include some information about how these services get
    built.

    the tricky question of assembly granularity.
-   [PowerShell
    Analyzer](http://powershell.com/store/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=2)
    is now available for purchase. Among other things your \$59 gets
    you, besides a 50% savings, is “[Feature request
    priority](http://powershelllive.com/)“. That’s pretty cool. I wonder
    how many other micro-ISV’s take the approach of “pay me now and you
    get to help me pick some of the new features.”

    about dual monitor support in Vista. I’m loving the dual monitor
    support, though I have a somewhat strange setup. I keep my primary
    monitor rotated in portrait mode, which is great for reading and
    writing. I typically use my second monitor for blogs and mail. I
    even wrote a custom multi-mon wallpaper utility so I could easily
    generate new wallpapers for my non-standard monitor layout,
    including bitmap rotate support. If there’s interest, I can post it.

    to write about Mort, with the usual response from the usual folks. I
    liked his point that “You cannot fight economics with education”,
    but otherwise I’m staying out of this discussion.
-   In the same vein, Martin Fowler
    [writes](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DesignStaminaHypothesis.html)
    about Technical Debt. I completely agree with his hypothesis that
    short changing design may save time in the short term but will cost
    much more in the long term. However, the problem is that the people
    who are making the tradeoff – i.e. the people paying for the project
    NOT the people building the project – either don’t understand the
    tradeoff or are more than happy to sacrifice the long term cost for
    the short term gain. How are most projects measured? Being on time
    and on budget with the planned set of features. Very few projects –
    and none that I’ve ever seen – are goaled on long term
    maintainability. Until you can change that, this issue will continue
    to linger.
