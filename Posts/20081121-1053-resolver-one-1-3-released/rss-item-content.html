They use IPy not only as the embedded language exposed to end users but as the underlying implementation language as well. </p><p>Furthermore, these guys are heavily involved in the IPy community. Resolver developer <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/index.shtml">Michael Foord</a> is <a href="http://www.ironpythoninaction.com/">writing a book on IronPython</a> and was our <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile=ACB6160C-9024-4838-98B7-3779DF6C79E8">first Dynamic Language MVP</a>. Michael’s Resolver colleague <a href="http://www.tartley.com/">Jonathan Hartley</a> did me a solid by <a href="http://www.oredev.org/topmenu/program/trackcoollanguages/jonathanhartley.4.3efb083311ac562f9fe80006879.html">taking my space</a> at <a href="http://www.oredev.org">ØreDev</a>. Even the CTO and Co-founder <a href="http://www.gilesthomas.com/">Giles Thomas</a> is a regular blogger and speaker at events. Let me tell you, having guys this great in the community sure makes my job easier.</p><p>I just wanted to give the Resolver folks a shout out and say major congratulations on <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/news/?p=73">shipping a new version</a> of their core Resolver One product. Michael has <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2008_11_15.shtml#e1032">more info on this release</a> as well as a glance forward with their plans for their next (IPy 2.0, woot!)</p>
