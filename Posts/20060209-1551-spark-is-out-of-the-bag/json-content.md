As part of the [new
job](http://devhawk.net/2006/01/24/architect-on-the-edge/), I’m
involved in the planning a workshop called SPARK, which [Dion
Hinchcliffe](http://hinchcliffe.org/)[blogged
about](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=5) this morning. (Dion also
writes a [blog here](http://web2.wsj2.com/) - bringing the total to
three - so I created a [combined
feed](http://feedjumbler.com/88756a0/rss.xml) just to keep track of all
the places he writes). My new boss
[Mike](http://blogs.technet.com/michael_platt/default.aspx) also
[mentioned SPARK this
morning](http://blogs.technet.com/michael_platt/archive/2006/02/09/419148.aspx).
In the hopes of sparking futher interest (pun intended), here’s the
overview of SPARK:

> **SPARK** is the first in a series of high-level forums hosted by
> Microsoft that use a workshop setting to examine “the issues that
> matter most” in the practice of strategic architecture and produce
> guidance for the industry as a whole.
>
> Today, new social movements, advances in technology, and forces within
> business are overlapping to create a landscape glutted with challenges
> and opportunities. In many cases, these forces have driven the
> deployment of new technologies and the adoption of new behaviors,
> adding multiple layers to an already complex set of issues that must
> be navigated. Architects are searching for a solution that helps
> manage this complexity.
>
> SOA, Software as a Service, Web 2.0, and Edge are all elements of the
> solution, but are they the complete picture? Are they a sufficient
> answer to the issues?  Can they be used together in a productive and
> efficient fashion? What matters most?
