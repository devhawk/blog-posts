<p>As part of the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/01/24/Architect+On+The+Edge.aspx">new job</a>, I'm involved in the planning a workshop called SPARK, which <a href="http://hinchcliffe.org/">Dion Hinchcliffe</a><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=5">blogged about</a> this morning. (Dion also writes a <a href="http://web2.wsj2.com/">blog here</a> - bringing the total to three - so I created a <a href="http://feedjumbler.com/88756a0/rss.xml">combined feed</a> just to keep track of all the places he writes). My new boss <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/michael_platt/default.aspx">Mike</a> also <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/michael_platt/archive/2006/02/09/419148.aspx">mentioned SPARK this morning</a>. In the hopes of sparking futher interest (pun intended), here's the overview of SPARK:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p><strong>SPARK</strong> is the first in a series of high-level forums hosted by Microsoft that use a workshop setting to examine “the issues that matter most” in the practice of strategic architecture and produce guidance for the industry as a whole.</p><p>Today, new social movements, advances in technology, and forces within business are overlapping to create a landscape glutted with challenges and opportunities. In many cases, these forces have driven the deployment of new technologies and the adoption of new behaviors, adding multiple layers to an already complex set of issues that must be navigated. Architects are searching for a solution that helps manage this complexity.</p><p>SOA, Software as a Service, Web 2.0, and Edge are all elements of the solution, but are they the complete picture? Are they a sufficient answer to the issues?  Can they be used together in a productive and efficient fashion? What matters most?</p></blockquote>
