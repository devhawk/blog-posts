<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.feedreader.com">FeedReader</a> for aggregating news feeds, but I just downloaded and configured <a href="http://www.syndirella.net/">Syndirella</a>. I think I&#8217;m going to switch permanently since Syndirella handles some of the 2.0 RSS feeds that FeedReader can&#8217;t. (I want to try <a href="http://www.rassoc.com/newsgator/">News Gator</a>, but I&#8217;m not running a compatible version of Outlook). Additionally, Syndirella is a .NET app, which I like even if it has little bearing on the apps&#8217; functionallity.</p>
