I couldn’t blog about the [Outlook Integration
Sample](http://devhawk.net/2006/01/09/outlook-integration-sample/)
last week because we were waiting to see if the mainstream media would
pick up the news. CNET ran an [article about the
sample](http://news.com.com/Microsoft+shares+tools+for+unlocking+customer+data/2100-1012_3-6024821.html)
today. There’s also a link to the [Customer Explorer case
study](https://members.microsoft.com/customerevidence/search/EvidenceDetails.aspx?EvidenceID=13848&LanguageID=1)
that was the original inspiration for the Outlook Integration Sample and
VSTO Outlook in the first place.
