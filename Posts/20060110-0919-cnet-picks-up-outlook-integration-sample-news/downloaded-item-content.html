<p>I couldn&#8217;t blog about the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/01/10/Outlook+Integration+Sample.aspx">Outlook Integration Sample</a> last week because we were waiting to see if the mainstream media would pick up the news. CNET ran an <a href="http://news.com.com/Microsoft+shares+tools+for+unlocking+customer+data/2100-1012_3-6024821.html">article about the sample</a> today. There&#8217;s also a link to the <a href="https://members.microsoft.com/customerevidence/search/EvidenceDetails.aspx?EvidenceID=13848&LanguageID=1">Customer Explorer case study</a> that was the original inspiration for the Outlook Integration Sample and VSTO Outlook in the first place.</p>
