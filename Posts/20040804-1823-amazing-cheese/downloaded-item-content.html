<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e6de0496-b593-4657-acd8-d602523c3fc4">blogged about cheese</a> before, but it was in jest. However, the cheese here in Australia and New Zealand has been awesome. It&#8217;s like going to Tahiti and eating pineapple. When you come home to the same old stuff, it&#8217;s a real let down. Maybe I need to stop making fun of my coworker Earnie (he&#8217;s the one who showed me the American Cheese Society annual conference and awards).</p>
