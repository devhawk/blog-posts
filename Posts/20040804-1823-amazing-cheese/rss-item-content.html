<p>I've <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e6de0496-b593-4657-acd8-d602523c3fc4">blogged about cheese</a> before, but it was in jest. However, the cheese here in Australia and New Zealand has been awesome. It's like going to Tahiti and eating pineapple. When you come home to the same old stuff, it's a real let down. Maybe I need to stop making fun of my coworker Earnie (he's the one who showed me the American Cheese Society annual conference and awards).</p>
