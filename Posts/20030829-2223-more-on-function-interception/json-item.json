Dealing with the ability to override expected functionality is hard enough in object oriented languages. They call it the &#8220;fragile base class problem&#8221; for a reason. In JavaScript, you have the potential for the &#8220;fragile intercepted method problem&#8221;. Granted, <a href=\"art_submitfirefixup.aspx\">my solution<\/a> is also &#8220;intercepting&#8221; a method, albeit in a lo-tech, code injection, search-and-replace kind of way. But maintainability needs to be of paramount importance in system design. I don&#8217;t want to have to go mucking about in the plumbing primarily because plumbing skills are at a premium (I hear <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gotdotnet.com\/team\/dbox\/\"> Don<\/a> is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eweek.com\/print_article\/0,3668,a=45363,00.asp\"> trying to hire them<\/a> all for his team). <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I got an email from Steve Maine who used JavaScript&#8217;s support for function pointers to extend the Page_ClientValidate function.
