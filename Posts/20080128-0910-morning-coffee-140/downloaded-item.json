It wasn&#8217;t a lack of content, it was a lack of drive on my part. I had 20-30 items flagged in my news reader, but for some reason I couldn&#8217;t work up the interest in posting them. So some of these are a bit old.  <\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m at the Language.NET Symposium this week, so look for lots of language blogging. I&#8217;ve already chatted with <a href=\"http:\/\/tomasp.net\/\">Tom\u00e1\u0161 Pet\u0159\u00ed\u010dek<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iunknown.com\/\">John Lam<\/a>. If someone <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/01\/25\/By+The+Way+If+Anybody+Wants+To+Argue+About+Languages+Next+Week.aspx\">kicks Ted Neward&#8217;s ass<\/a> because he <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/01\/25\/So+I+Dont+Like+Perl+Sue+Me.aspx\">hates Perl<\/a>, I&#8217;ll try and liveblog it.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Ted Neward, he <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/01\/24\/Can+Dynamic+Languages+Scale.aspx\">discusses<\/a> the question &#8220;Can Dynamic Languages Scale?&#8221; without devolving into a flame-fest. I agree 100% with his point about the difference between performance scaling and complexity scaling. Personally, I tend to err on the side of better complexity scaling, since buying hardware is easier than hiring developers.  <\/li>\n<li>Nick Malik <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/nickmalik\/archive\/2008\/01\/23\/the-future-can-be-seen-if-we-decide-to-look.aspx\">responds<\/a> to me calling his shared global integration vision <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/01\/22\/Nicks+Flawed+Vision+Of+A+Shared+Integration+Model.aspx\">flawed<\/a>. He points to NGOSS\/eTOM as an example of a shared iterative model that works. I know squat about that shared model, so I&#8217;ll refrain from commenting until I do a little homework on the telco industry.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of shared interop models, Microsoft is <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.live.com\/blogs\/devlive\/archive\/2008\/01\/24\/203.aspx\">joining DataPortability.org<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.25hoursaday.com\/weblog\/2008\/01\/24\/MicrosoftJoinsDataportabilityorg.aspx\">Dare Obasanjo<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.broadbandmechanics.com\/2008\/01\/dataportabilityorg-gradually-eeking-its-way-out-of-the-reality-distortion-echo-chamber#comments\">Marc Canter<\/a> are skeptical that so far this effort is all hype and no substance. Reminds me a bit of AttentionTrust.org. But if DataPortability.org can get off the ground, maybe there&#8217;s hope for Nick&#8217;s vision (or vis-versa). <\/li>\n<li>Don Syme <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dsyme\/archive\/2008\/01\/25\/update-to-the-f-1-9-3-release.aspx\">lists what&#8217;s new<\/a> in the latest F# release. As I said, this release is pretty light on features. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll get some details  <\/li>\n<li>Tomas Restrepo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winterdom.com\/weblog\/2008\/01\/24\/ModifyingTheHomeInPowerShell.aspx\">shows<\/a> how to change your home folder in PowerShell. I need to do this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I only posted one Morning Coffee post last week. It wasn&#8217;t a lack of content, it was a lack of drive on my part.
