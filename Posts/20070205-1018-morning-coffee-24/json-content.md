-   Congrats to the Colts on [winning the ugliest Super Bowl
    ever](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270204003). Pouring
    rain, eight turnovers, missed PAT and field goal and the opening
    kickoff TD return. Ugly, but fun to watch.
-   Now that we’ve had our first poor-weather Super Bowl, I think it’s
    time to start rotating through cities that have never gotten it due
    to expected weather conditions. Obviously, I’d like to see a Super
    Bowl at [Qwest Field](http://www.qwestfield.com/). But most of all,
    I would love to see the Super Bowl played in Green Bay on the
    “frozen tundra” of [Lambeau Field](http://www.lambeaufield.com/).
-   Was it just me, or did the Super Bowl ads suck this year?
-   There’s a sweet looking [pinball game](http://www.pinballfx.com/)
    coming to [XBLA](http://www.xbox.com/games/livearcadexbox360). I
    love pinball, so unless it completely stinks I’ll be buying it.
-   I commented on the Windows Live SDK last week, but I missed the
    [Windows Live ID Client
    SDK](http://winliveid.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns%21AEE1BB0D86E23AAC%21684.entry)
    alpha release. It looks like you can use this SDK to build desktop
    applications that use Windows Live ID for authentication. Fairly
    cool, but does it work with non WL services? (via [Dare
    Obasanjo](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=36544f84-b1c0-458c-ac17-f7fccffd4a45))
-   I saw [this
    post](http://vaultofthoughts.net/GettingTheLocationOfAppDataFolder.aspx) on
    the home page of [DotNetKicks](http://Dotnetkicks.com) today. It
    claims that locating the ASP.NET App\_Data directory by calling
    AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetData(“DataDirectory”) is a “dirty
    hack”. I left a comment on the original post, but I wonder if the
    correct information will ever make it’s way back to DNK? 
-   [Architecture
    Comix](http://www.skyscrapr.net/blogs/comix/default.aspx)? Yep, on
    [Skyscrapr](http://www.skyscrapr.net/), an architect community site
    run by my old team. Sorta funny, but I’m guessing [Scott
    Adams](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/) isn’t worried about the
    competition yet.
