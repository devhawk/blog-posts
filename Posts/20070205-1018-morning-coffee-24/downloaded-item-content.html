<li>Congrats to the Colts on <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270204003">winning the ugliest Super Bowl ever</a>. Pouring rain, eight turnovers, missed PAT and field goal and the opening kickoff TD return.&nbsp;Ugly, but fun to watch.  </li>
<li>Now that we&#8217;ve had our first poor-weather Super Bowl, I think it&#8217;s time to start rotating through cities that have never gotten it due to expected weather conditions. Obviously, I&#8217;d like to see a Super Bowl at <a href="http://www.qwestfield.com/">Qwest Field</a>. But most of all, I would love to see the&nbsp;Super Bowl played in Green Bay on the &#8220;frozen&nbsp;tundra&#8221; of <a href="http://www.lambeaufield.com/">Lambeau Field</a>.  </li>
<li>Was it just me, or did the Super Bowl ads suck this year? </li>
<li>There&#8217;s a sweet looking <a href="http://www.pinballfx.com/">pinball game</a> coming to <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/livearcadexbox360">XBLA</a>. I love pinball, so unless it completely stinks I&#8217;ll be buying it.  </li>
<li>I commented on the Windows Live SDK last week, but I missed the <a href="http://winliveid.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns%21AEE1BB0D86E23AAC%21684.entry">Windows Live ID Client SDK</a> alpha release. It looks like you can use this SDK to build desktop applications that use Windows Live ID for authentication. Fairly cool, but does it work with non WL services?

<li>I saw <a href="http://vaultofthoughts.net/GettingTheLocationOfAppDataFolder.aspx">this post</a>&nbsp;on the home page of <a href="http://Dotnetkicks.com">DotNetKicks</a>&nbsp;today. It claims that locating the ASP.NET App_Data directory by calling AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetData(&#8220;DataDirectory&#8221;) is a &#8220;dirty hack&#8221;.&nbsp;I left a comment on the&nbsp;original post, but I wonder if the correct&nbsp;information will ever make it&#8217;s way back to DNK?&nbsp; </li>
<li><a href="http://www.skyscrapr.net/blogs/comix/default.aspx">Architecture Comix</a>?&nbsp;Yep, on <a href="http://www.skyscrapr.net/">Skyscrapr</a>, an architect community site run by my old team. Sorta funny, but I&#8217;m guessing <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/">Scott Adams</a> isn&#8217;t worried about the competition yet.</li>
