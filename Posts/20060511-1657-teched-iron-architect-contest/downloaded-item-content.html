<p>For a change,&nbsp;I&#8217;m not involved with TechEd at ALL this year. It&#8217;s all Simon and Marty. Looks like they&#8217;ve got some cool stuff cooking, particularly the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ironarchitect/">Iron Architect contest</a>. Almost makes me wish I was going this year. </p>
