It&#8217;s a personal blog &#8211; my very tiny corner of the web, if you will &#8211; so I feel totally justified writing about technology, politics, hockey and whatever else I want to. I figure that if you don&#8217;t like it, you&#8217;re free to unsubscribe and neither of either of us will lose any sleep over it.<\/p>\n<p>The flip side is that DevHawk has traditionally been the <em>only <\/em>place where I exercise such lack-of-restraint. When my blog was featured on <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/architecture\">MSDN Architecture Center<\/a>, I cross-posted relevant content to a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/devhawk\">separate blog<\/a> so as to create an topic-focused and safe-for-work subset of my &#8220;real&#8221; blog. It was always a hassle &#8211; especially tracking comments to the same post in two places &#8211; and I <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/devhawk\/archive\/2006\/08\/21\/710966.aspx\">quit doing it<\/a> shortly after leaving the Architecture Strategy Team.<\/p>\n<p>However, now that I&#8217;m <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/devhawk\">using Twitter<\/a>, it doesn&#8217;t feel like DevHawk is &#8220;my <em>only<\/em> place&#8221; anymore. My blog == my writing, my del.icio.us == <a href=\"http:\/\/del.icio.us\/harrypierson\">links I find interesting<\/a> and my Twitter == <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/devhawk\">real time updates<\/a>. I use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.feedburner.com\">FeedBurner<\/a> to include my del.icio.us links in my blog feed and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitterfeed.com\/\">twitterfeed<\/a> to include the blog feed in my twitter feed. Therefore, Twitter is the <em>only <\/em>place to get <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/statuses\/user_timeline\/14137542.rss\">an feed<\/a> of all three. Obviously, Twitter&#8217;s feed isn&#8217;t full content, but in an always connected world, clicking the link to read the blog entry in the browser isn&#8217;t that big a deal. Besides, you can always subscribe to both the blog and twitter feed if you want full content + real-time.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t fully integrated Twitter into my daily life yet, though I&#8217;m getting there &#8211; for example I <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/devhawk\/statuses\/774803604\">twittered the results<\/a> of my hockey game last night. But unlike other social software sites, I think I&#8217;m going to be using Twitter regularly. I&#8217;m <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/p\/Harry_Pierson\/537304487\">on Facebook<\/a>, but there&#8217;s too much &#8220;you&#8217;ve been bitten by a Vampire!&#8221; type spam to really <em>use <\/em>it for anything but pure entertainment. Twitter is more like blogging, where there&#8217;s an information exchange with only the people I <strike>subscribe to<\/strike> follow. Also, maybe it&#8217;s me, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be the same stigma if you stop following someone on Twitter compared to rejecting them as a friend on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>DevHawk has been &#8220;me&#8221;, but now it feels like DevHawk @ Twitter will become &#8220;me&#8221; which leaves my blog to become my endless book. It&#8217;s not a bad thing, but it does feel a little strange.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Sometimes when I blog about politics, I&#8217;ll get a comment like this: As far as I&#8217;m concerned, posting about topics such as politics or religions on a blog that&#8217;s supposedly about technology is just looking for trouble.

The host is entitled to say what he or she wants &#8212; it&#8217;s their place and they&#8217;re paying after all. However, some degree of manners towards your guests is a nice thing. People may hold different opinions and sometimes being receptive (not necessarily persuaded) is a good thing.
