<p>Sometimes when I blog about politics, I&#8217;ll get a <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,d88e8506-d669-41c3-a246-6da1865f9a2e.aspx#commentstart">comment like this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As far as I&#8217;m concerned, posting about topics such as politics or religions on a blog that&#8217;s supposedly about technology is just looking for trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/04/03/This+Is+Not+A+Technical+Blog.aspx">pointed out before</a>, DevHawk is not &#8220;a blog that&#8217;s supposedly about technology&#8221;. It&#8217;s a personal blog &#8211; my very tiny corner of the web, if you will &#8211; so I feel totally justified writing about technology, politics, hockey and whatever else I want to. I figure that if you don&#8217;t like it, you&#8217;re free to unsubscribe and neither of either of us will lose any sleep over it.</p>
<p>The flip side is that DevHawk has traditionally been the <em>only </em>place where I exercise such lack-of-restraint. When my blog was featured on <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/architecture">MSDN Architecture Center</a>, I cross-posted relevant content to a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk">separate blog</a> so as to create an topic-focused and safe-for-work subset of my &#8220;real&#8221; blog. It was always a hassle &#8211; especially tracking comments to the same post in two places &#8211; and I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk/archive/2006/08/21/710966.aspx">quit doing it</a> shortly after leaving the Architecture Strategy Team.</p>
<p>However, now that I&#8217;m <a href="http://twitter.com/devhawk">using Twitter</a>, it doesn&#8217;t feel like DevHawk is &#8220;my <em>only</em> place&#8221; anymore. My blog == my writing, my del.icio.us == <a href="http://del.icio.us/harrypierson">links I find interesting</a> and my Twitter == <a href="http://twitter.com/devhawk">real time updates</a>. I use <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a> to include my del.icio.us links in my blog feed and <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">twitterfeed</a> to include the blog feed in my twitter feed. Therefore, Twitter is the <em>only </em>place to get <a href="http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/14137542.rss">an feed</a> of all three. Obviously, Twitter&#8217;s feed isn&#8217;t full content, but in an always connected world, clicking the link to read the blog entry in the browser isn&#8217;t that big a deal. Besides, you can always subscribe to both the blog and twitter feed if you want full content + real-time.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t fully integrated Twitter into my daily life yet, though I&#8217;m getting there &#8211; for example I <a href="http://twitter.com/devhawk/statuses/774803604">twittered the results</a> of my hockey game last night. But unlike other social software sites, I think I&#8217;m going to be using Twitter regularly. I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.facebook.com/p/Harry_Pierson/537304487">on Facebook</a>, but there&#8217;s too much &#8220;you&#8217;ve been bitten by a Vampire!&#8221; type spam to really <em>use </em>it for anything but pure entertainment. Twitter is more like blogging, where there&#8217;s an information exchange with only the people I <strike>subscribe to</strike> follow. Also, maybe it&#8217;s me, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be the same stigma if you stop following someone on Twitter compared to rejecting them as a friend on Facebook.</p>
<p>DevHawk has been &#8220;me&#8221;, but now it feels like DevHawk @ Twitter will become &#8220;me&#8221; which leaves my blog to become my endless book. It&#8217;s not a bad thing, but it does feel a little strange.</p>
