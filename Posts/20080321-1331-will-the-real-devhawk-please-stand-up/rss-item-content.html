<p>Sometimes when I blog about politics, I'll get a <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,d88e8506-d669-41c3-a246-6da1865f9a2e.aspx#commentstart">comment like this</a>:</p><blockquote><p>As far as I'm concerned, posting about topics such as politics or religions on a blog that's supposedly about technology is just looking for trouble.</p></blockquote><p>As I've <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/04/03/This+Is+Not+A+Technical+Blog.aspx">pointed out before</a>, DevHawk is not "a blog that's supposedly about technology". It's a personal blog - my very tiny corner of the web, if you will - so I feel totally justified writing about technology, politics, hockey and whatever else I want to. I figure that if you don't like it, you're free to unsubscribe and neither of either of us will lose any sleep over it.</p><p>The flip side is that DevHawk has traditionally been the <em>only </em>place where I exercise such lack-of-restraint. When my blog was featured on <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/architecture">MSDN Architecture Center</a>, I cross-posted relevant content to a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk">separate blog</a> so as to create an topic-focused and safe-for-work subset of my "real" blog. It was always a hassle - especially tracking comments to the same post in two places - and I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk/archive/2006/08/21/710966.aspx">quit doing it</a> shortly after leaving the Architecture Strategy Team.</p><p>However, now that I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/devhawk">using Twitter</a>, it doesn't feel like DevHawk is "my <em>only</em> place" anymore. My blog == my writing, my del.icio.us == <a href="http://del.icio.us/harrypierson">links I find interesting</a> and my Twitter == <a href="http://twitter.com/devhawk">real time updates</a>. I use <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a> to include my del.icio.us links in my blog feed and <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">twitterfeed</a> to include the blog feed in my twitter feed. Therefore, Twitter is the <em>only </em>place to get <a href="http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/14137542.rss">an feed</a> of all three. Obviously, Twitter's feed isn't full content, but in an always connected world, clicking the link to read the blog entry in the browser isn't that big a deal. Besides, you can always subscribe to both the blog and twitter feed if you want full content + real-time.</p><p>I haven't fully integrated Twitter into my daily life yet, though I'm getting there - for example I <a href="http://twitter.com/devhawk/statuses/774803604">twittered the results</a> of my hockey game last night. But unlike other social software sites, I think I'm going to be using Twitter regularly. I'm <a href="http://www.facebook.com/p/Harry_Pierson/537304487">on Facebook</a>, but there's too much "you've been bitten by a Vampire!" type spam to really <em>use </em>it for anything but pure entertainment. Twitter is more like blogging, where there's an information exchange with only the people I <strike>subscribe to</strike> follow. Also, maybe it's me, but there doesn't seem to be the same stigma if you stop following someone on Twitter compared to rejecting them as a friend on Facebook.</p><p>DevHawk has been "me", but now it feels like DevHawk @ Twitter will become "me" which leaves my blog to become my endless book. It's not a bad thing, but it does feel a little strange.</p>
