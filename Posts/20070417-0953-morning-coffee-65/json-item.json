Earlier in my MSFT career, I spent a significant amount of time explaining .NET, often\u00a0to companies that had made a significant investment in Java. Picking the Java platform is fine (it&#8217;s almost the best platform around!), but it seemed many people I spoke to didn&#8217;t understand the fact that &#8220;[w]hen you choose a language, like it or not, you&#8217;ve chosen a <i>platform<\/i>&#8220;.  <\/li>\n<li>Ian Thomas <a href=\"http:\/\/itblagger.wordpress.com\/2007\/04\/10\/soa-as-internal-saas\/\">riffs<\/a> on my\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/03\/21\/When+Is+A+Service+Not+A+Service.aspx\">When is a Service Not a Service<\/a>\u00a0post. I like Ian&#8217;s thinking about SaaS as an analogy for SOA adoption &#8211; if for no other reason that SaaS is easier to &#8220;get&#8221;. But trying to realize SOA via SaaS inside the enterprise is a mistake in my opinion (and I think Ian would agree with that). SaaS is a business model, and I don&#8217;t think you want to turn your enterprise into an internal\u00a0service marketplace.
