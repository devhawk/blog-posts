<li>My brother is a VaTech alumni, so&nbsp;the shock of the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18134671/">deadly shootings there yesterday</a> hits very close to home. My heavy heart is with the grieving Hokie nation today.  </li>
<li>Jeff Atwood has a couple of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000838.html">great</a><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000839.html">posts</a> on Language vs. Platform. Earlier in my MSFT career, I spent a significant amount of time explaining .NET, often&nbsp;to companies that had made a significant investment in Java. Picking the Java platform is fine (it&#8217;s almost the best platform around!), but it seemed many people I spoke to didn&#8217;t understand the fact that &#8220;[w]hen you choose a language, like it or not, you&#8217;ve chosen a <i>platform</i>&#8220;.  </li>
<li>Ian Thomas <a href="http://itblagger.wordpress.com/2007/04/10/soa-as-internal-saas/">riffs</a> on my&nbsp;<a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/21/When+Is+A+Service+Not+A+Service.aspx">When is a Service Not a Service</a>&nbsp;post. I like Ian&#8217;s thinking about SaaS as an analogy for SOA adoption &#8211; if for no other reason that SaaS is easier to &#8220;get&#8221;. But trying to realize SOA via SaaS inside the enterprise is a mistake in my opinion (and I think Ian would agree with that). SaaS is a business model, and I don&#8217;t think you want to turn your enterprise into an internal&nbsp;service marketplace. Instead, this ties back with Nick Malik&#8217;s points about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/04/14/is-central-planning-impossible.aspx">central planning</a>.&nbsp;Regardless if I&#8217;m&nbsp;right or wrong,&nbsp;I <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/itblagger">subscribed</a> to Ian&#8217;s blog (and not just because he linked to me &#8211; check out his <a title="Read Elements of the Future Business Ecosystem (Part I)" href="http://itblagger.wordpress.com/2007/04/07/elements-of-the-future-business-ecosystem-part-i/">Elements of the Future Business Ecosystem</a>) </li>
<li>TLA Watch: Oracle coins Application Integration Architecture (aka AIA). Joe McKendrick <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=857">calls it</a> &#8220;Big SOA&#8221;. Isn&#8217;t this the market segment that BizTalk has been in for seven years?</li>
