<p>As of WS-I Basic Profile 1.0, Web Services are &#8220;hopelessly tied to HTTP&#8221;. It isn&#8217;t until you add in all the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx"> GXA Specifications</a> that you start breaking up the marriage to HTTP (and the <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/tewald/default.aspx?key=2003-03-21T03:23:54Z"> RPC Processing Model</a>). Quoting from the WS-I spec:</p>
<blockquote><p>SOAP 1.1 defines a single protocol binding, for HTTP. The Profile mandates the use of that binding</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>R2702 : A DESCRIPTION MUST use HTTP transport protocol with SOAP binding. Specifically, the transport attribute of soapbind:binding element MUST have the value &#8220;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http&#8221;.</p>
<p>For interoperability the transport protocol is limited to HTTP. To permit secure transfers at the HTTP level use of HTTP(S) is allowed.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href="http://microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=06255A94-2635-4D29-A90C-28B282993A41&displaylang=en"> WSE toolkit</a> is NOT tied to HTTP. One of the more interesting classes in the toolkit is SoapEnvelope. It&#8217;s an extension to XmlDocument that adds all the SOAP specific logic. So if you want to do web services w/o being tied to HTTP, WSE provides all the plumbing you need &#8211; just add the transport. </p>
