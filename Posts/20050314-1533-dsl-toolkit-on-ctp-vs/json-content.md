Doug [wanted to
know](http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk/archive/2005/03/10/391314.aspx#395085)
if the new DSL toolkit runs on the [December
CTP](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/get/default.aspx#ctp) of VSTS.
In a word, no. The [March DSL
Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=57a14cc6-c084-48dd-b401-1845013bf834&DisplayLang=en)
requires Beta 1 of VS05 Beta 1 or Beta 1 refresh. However, at some
point, there will be a version of the DSL Toolkit that runs on VS05 Beta
2. (“At some point” meaning not on the day that VS05 Beta 2 ships but
some short period of time after that.)

This is why I use [Virtual
PC](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc). I can install the CTP
build in one VPC and the Beta 1 build w/ DSL toolkit in another.
