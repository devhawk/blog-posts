<p>Washington Capitals record in the past four games: 4-0<br>Washington Capitals record in the past ten games: 4-4-2</p>
<p>That is what in the business of hockey you call &#8220;streaky&#8221;. </p>
<p>When your recent winning streak includes wins over Dallas (16-8 at the time, 19-9 now) and Eastern conference leading Buffalo (20-3-2 then, 21-4-2 now), you can feel pretty good about yourself. Being only one point out of the playoffs doesn&#8217;t hurt either. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the East is a beast this year. Only Florida and Philadelphia are below .500. Everyone else is in the thick of the playoff hunt. Another six game slide would really hurt the Caps&#8217; playoff chances. By comparison in the West, seven of the fifteen teams are below .500 (i.e. everyone not currently in a playoff spot). Dallas, at ten games over .500 is <u>3rd</u> in the Pacific Division behind Anaheim (+18) and San Jose (+12). </p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s always nice to be looking down on the Penguins in the standings. But their not far behind. Their 26 points puts them in 13th place in the East, but they&#8217;re at .500 (11-11-4) and only five points out of a playoff spot. Next Monday&#8217;s game should be a good one. It&#8217;s even on <a href="http://www.versus.com/nw/article/view/1367/?tf=NHLArticleWrapper.tpl">national TV</a> in HD!</p>
