<p>As if the <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/ide">VS.NET PowerToys</a> weren&#8217;t cool enough, now you can join <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/messageboard/Thread.aspx?id=107870"> GotDotNet communities</a> and help contribute to their development. Actually, I should say &#8220;will be able to help contribute&#8221; as all the links the the specific communities are not working yet. </p>
<p>As a bonus, you can get (will be able to get) access to an alpha build of the VSCMDShell Window PowerToy.</p>
