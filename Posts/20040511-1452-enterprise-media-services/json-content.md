The more I understand about [Windows Media Services
9](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/winmedia/default.mspx),
the more I like it. I especially like the fact that can create your own
[data source
plug-in](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmsrvsdk/htm/creatingdatasourceplugins.asp)
as part of a [custom broadcasting
solution](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=64a18811-757d-4599-8363-6a277214d26f).
However, one quick gotcha – you can only use custom plug-ins with [WS03
Enterprise
Edition](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmsrvsdk/htm/windowsnetenterpriseserversupport.asp).
Didn’t realize until I had built and configured my virtual media server
and compiled the [sample data source
plug-in](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmsrvsdk/htm/datasourcepluginsample.asp).
Annoying, but not the end of the world.
