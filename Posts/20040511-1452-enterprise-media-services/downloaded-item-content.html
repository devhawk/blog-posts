<p>The more I understand about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/winmedia/default.mspx">Windows Media Services 9</a>, the more I like it. I especially like the fact that can create your own <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmsrvsdk/htm/creatingdatasourceplugins.asp">data source plug-in</a> as part of a <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=64a18811-757d-4599-8363-6a277214d26f">custom broadcasting solution</a>. However, one quick gotcha &#8211; you can only use custom plug-ins with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmsrvsdk/htm/windowsnetenterpriseserversupport.asp">WS03 Enterprise Edition</a>. Didn&#8217;t realize until I had built and&nbsp;configured my virtual media server and compiled the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmsrvsdk/htm/datasourcepluginsample.asp">sample data source plug-in</a>. Annoying, but not the end of the world.</p>
