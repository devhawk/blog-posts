  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Harry - nice blog entry. My comment on Twitter wasn't really aimed at you - I was hoping to prod Dino, MArtin or Sri into blogging more!

One question. When IronPython 3 is started, targeting CPython 3.0, will you actively maintain IronPython and IronPython 3 in parallel?

This is what the Python developers will do for several years to come as it will be a long time before the majority of the community has switched over to Python 3. OF course because of the Unicode strings Python 3 is a better fit for IronPython, but for example the library support outside the standard library won't be there for quite a long time.]]></wp:comment_content>
