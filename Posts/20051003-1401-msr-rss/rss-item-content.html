<p>I hadn't realized it, but Microsoft Research is <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/rss/">RSS Enabled</a>Â with seperate feeds for <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/rss/news.xml">news</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/rss/downloads.xml">downloads</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/rss/publications.xml">publications</a>. As you would expect, there's some cool stuff up there. The current headline caught my eye: <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/displayArticle.aspx?id=1313">Concurrent Programming Enters Atomic Age</a>. We spent some time discussing this with the ARC MVPs, so it was fresh in my mind.</p>
