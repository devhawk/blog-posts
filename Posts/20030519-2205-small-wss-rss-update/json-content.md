I’ve made a private update to [WSS RSS](prj_sharepointsynd.aspx). The
new build supports both dc:date and pubDate. Sorry
[Don](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx), not enough news
aggregators grok dc:date yet. Also, the new version filters expired
items from the RSS feed. I’m not releasing this build – I don’t think 5
lines of code qualifies as a point release. If you want it, [email
me](mailto:harry@devhawk.net). Otherwise, I’m working on have UI support
in v0.4.
