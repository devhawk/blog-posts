<p>I&#8217;ve made a private update to <a href="prj_sharepointsynd.aspx">WSS RSS</a>. The new build supports both dc:date and pubDate. Sorry <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx">Don</a>, not enough news aggregators grok dc:date yet. Also, the new version filters expired items from the RSS feed. I&#8217;m not releasing this build &#8211; I don&#8217;t think 5 lines of code qualifies as a point release. If you want it, <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net"> email me</a>. Otherwise, I&#8217;m working on have UI support in v0.4. </p>
