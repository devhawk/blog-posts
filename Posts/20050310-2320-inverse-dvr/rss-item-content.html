<p>Usually you use your DVR to watch the show and skip the commercials. Today, however, I did the opposite. Used the DVR to blow thru 58 minutes of The OC to catch the new <a href="http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/">Star Wars Episode III</a> trailer. Pretty cool stuff. As an added bouns, they also had the trailer for <a href="http://www.sincitythemovie.com/">Sin City</a>. I didn't realize Robert Rodriguez was directing.</p>
