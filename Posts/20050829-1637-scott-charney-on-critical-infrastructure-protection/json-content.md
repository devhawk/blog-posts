[Scott
Charney](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/charney/default.mspx)
is the Vice President of Trustworthy Computing for Microsoft. If you’ve
never seen him present, check out this talk on [Critical Infrastructure
Protection](http://www.researchchannel.org/program/displayevent.asp?rid=2139)
that he gave at UW last year. Even if you don’t care about critical
infrastructure protection (all none of you) you should check out Scott’s
talk because he’s a great presenter. Great stories, great connection
with the audience and no ~~crutches~~ slides.
