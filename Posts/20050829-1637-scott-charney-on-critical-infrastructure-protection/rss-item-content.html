<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/charney/default.mspx">Scott Charney</a> is the Vice President of Trustworthy Computing for Microsoft. If you've never seen him present, check out this talk on <a href="http://www.researchchannel.org/program/displayevent.asp?rid=2139">Critical Infrastructure Protection</a> that he gave at UW last year. Even if you don't care about critical infrastructure protection (all none of you) you should check out Scott's talk because he's a great presenter. Great stories, great connection with the audience and no <strike>crutches</strike> slides. </p>
