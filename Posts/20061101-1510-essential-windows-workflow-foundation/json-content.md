On [Don’s
recommendation](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/10/25/41185.aspx),
I picked up [Essential
WF](http://www.aw-bc.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0321399838,00.html).
In the forward, Don writes “[S]omething big is about to happen.” I’m
only part way thru chapter one, and this is already a must read. Go get
it. Now.

In the
[preface](http://www.aw-bc.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0321399838-PRE,00.html),
they define the term “Reactive Program”, which I’m adding to my personal
lexicon.

That “unknown amounts of time” is the kicker. Here’s a paragraph from
early in chapter one that expands on that:

> “Real-world processes take a long time – days, weeks, or even months.
> It is wishful thinking to assume that the operating system process (or
> CLR application domain) in which the program begins execution will

Gee, that [sounds
familiar](http://devhawk.net/2006/10/23/the-other-foundation-technology/)
doesn’t it?
