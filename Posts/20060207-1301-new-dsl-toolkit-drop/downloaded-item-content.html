<p>I have been so focused on Web 2.0 stuff that I&#8217;ve been reading a bunch of new blogs and disregarding the old ones I used to read. So I didn&#8217;t realize until today that the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/DSLTools/">DSL Tools</a> team released a <a href="http://affiliate.vsipmembers.com/affiliate/downloadfiles.aspx">new drop</a> last week. According to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/">Gareth</a>, the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration into the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/extend/">Visual Studio SDK</a>. According to the site, they are shooting for an April release for v2 of the VS2005 SDK, so does that mean the DSL Tools will be done in April?
</li>
<li>Single file format and complete visual designer for all aspects of a DSL. I&#8217;m guessing this mean we no longer have to edit the designer definition by hand. That&#8217;s a good thing. But I liked the seperation of domain model and designer, so I&#8217;ll be interested to see how I like what they&#8217;ve built.
</li>
<li>Domain-specifiic model serialization. This is huge &#8211; previously, the domain model dictated the XML serialization format. Now, if you can customize this, you can provide a clean model syntax and even possibly read in other syntaxes as well
</li>
<li>Port Shapes and a revised modeling API</li>
</ul>
<p>Update: Apparently, <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,927e400c-d23b-41b5-848d-101feb4e6371.aspx">I can&#8217;t read</a>. Only the VS SDK integration is done in this build. improvements to the file format and model serialization will be in the next drop.</p>
