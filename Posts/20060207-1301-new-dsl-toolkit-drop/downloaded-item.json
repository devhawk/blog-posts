So I didn&#8217;t realize until today that the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/vstudio\/DSLTools\/\">DSL Tools<\/a> team released a <a href=\"http:\/\/affiliate.vsipmembers.com\/affiliate\/downloadfiles.aspx\">new drop<\/a> last week. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/garethj\/\">Gareth<\/a>, the highlights include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration into the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/vstudio\/extend\/\">Visual Studio SDK<\/a>. According to the site, they are shooting for an April release for v2 of the VS2005 SDK, so does that mean the DSL Tools will be done in April?\n<\/li>\n<li>Single file format and complete visual designer for all aspects of a DSL. I&#8217;m guessing this mean we no longer have to edit the designer definition by hand. That&#8217;s a good thing. But I liked the seperation of domain model and designer, so I&#8217;ll be interested to see how I like what they&#8217;ve built.\n<\/li>\n<li>Domain-specifiic model serialization. This is huge &#8211; previously, the domain model dictated the XML serialization format. Now, if you can customize this, you can provide a clean model syntax and even possibly read in other syntaxes as well\n<\/li>\n<li>Port Shapes and a revised modeling API<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Update: Apparently, <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/CommentView,guid,927e400c-d23b-41b5-848d-101feb4e6371.aspx\">I can&#8217;t read<\/a>. Only the VS SDK integration is done in this build. improvements to the file format and model serialization will be in the next drop.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I have been so focused on Web 2.0 stuff that I&#8217;ve been reading a bunch of new blogs and disregarding the old ones I used to read.
