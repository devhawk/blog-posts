I wish they would provide more details on this plan, continuations might not be the most interesting thing in Ruby, but it&#8217;s up there and it&#8217;s probably the hardest thing to implement on top of the CLR.<\/p>\n<p>BTW, there are two other projects @ QIT that Ruby.NET leverages that look interesting. The <a href=\"http:\/\/plas.fit.qut.edu.au\/gppg\/\">Gardens Point Parser Generator<\/a> is essentially a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yacc\">YACC<\/a> clone written in C# and making extensive use of generics. Personally, I&#8217;m more interested in <a href=\"http:\/\/pdos.csail.mit.edu\/~baford\/packrat\/\">Parsing Expression Grammars<\/a>, but there&#8217;s no C# implementation as of yet. QIT also has a library for <em><a href=\"http:\/\/plas.fit.qut.edu.au\/perwapi\/\">reading and writing program executable files<\/a><\/em> (i.e. EXEs and DLLs). <\/p>\n<p>As a quick aside, I&#8217;m getting pretty tired of all the different euphemisms for &#8220;alpha&#8221;. In the age of perpetual beta, isn&#8217;t alpha the new beta? But everyone seems worried about calling their releases alpha as if it means &#8220;it might not cause your machine to explode, if you could actually get it to compile&#8221;. So we end up with things like &#8220;Preliminary Beta&#8221; and &#8220;Community Tech Preview&#8221;. We all KNOW what these terms mean, so lets just call an alpha and alpha, shall we?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m not sure what a &#8220;Preliminary Beta&#8221; is but QIT\u00a0has released a one for their Ruby.NET compiler.
