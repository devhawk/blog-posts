<p>I&#8217;m not sure what a &#8220;Preliminary Beta&#8221; is but <a href="http://www.qut.edu.au/">QIT</a>&nbsp;has released a one for their <a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/Ruby.NET/">Ruby.NET compiler</a>. They expect to achieve &#8220;full semantic compatibility&#8221; (can you tell this is an acidemic project?) by the end of the year. Thanks to <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=fae70ab9-29c8-44f1-b076-46eee9f839d1">David Ing</a> for the link.</p>
<p>They claim to &#8220;pass all 871 tests in the samples/test.rb installation test suite of <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> 1.8.2.&#8221; which seems odd since later they say &#8220;We have a plan for how to deal with continuations but we have not yet implemented them.&#8221; Doesn&#8217;t the Ruby test suite test continuations? I wish they would provide more details on this plan, continuations might not be the most interesting thing in Ruby, but it&#8217;s up there and it&#8217;s probably the hardest thing to implement on top of the CLR.</p>
<p>BTW, there are two other projects @ QIT that Ruby.NET leverages that look interesting. The <a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/gppg/">Gardens Point Parser Generator</a> is essentially a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc">YACC</a> clone written in C# and making extensive use of generics. Personally, I&#8217;m more interested in <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/">Parsing Expression Grammars</a>, but there&#8217;s no C# implementation as of yet. QIT also has a library for <em><a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/perwapi/">reading and writing program executable files</a></em> (i.e. EXEs and DLLs). </p>
<p>As a quick aside, I&#8217;m getting pretty tired of all the different euphemisms for &#8220;alpha&#8221;. In the age of perpetual beta, isn&#8217;t alpha the new beta? But everyone seems worried about calling their releases alpha as if it means &#8220;it might not cause your machine to explode, if you could actually get it to compile&#8221;. So we end up with things like &#8220;Preliminary Beta&#8221; and &#8220;Community Tech Preview&#8221;. We all KNOW what these terms mean, so lets just call an alpha and alpha, shall we?</p>
