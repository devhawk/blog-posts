Apparently, Napster is going to be offering an upgrade to their current unlimited streaming service next year that will support portable devices. For $5 more a month (a grand total of $15 a month) you can transfer an unlimited number of Napster&#8217;s 700,000 tracks to a compatible portable device. Major Cool. In Napster&#8217;s CEO&#8217;s own words:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>You can fit 10,000 songs on [a top-of-the-line iPod], but to do that would cost you $10,000 if you bought the songs from Apple. With our plan, customers can get 10,000 songs on their device for $180 a year. It&#8217;s an enormous value.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I had the Napster streaming service for a while, but the inability to take the music on the go was the major reason I canceled it. My 40GB Nomad Zen Xtra is only 55% full &#8211; I would re-subscribe to this service in a second if I could use it to fill up the remaining 17GB. Unfortunately, according to the article, the Zen Xtra isn&#8217;t one of the six devices that works with the new DRM technology&#8230;yet. Creative is supposed to upgrade their Zen Micro (again, according to the article) early next year. I would expect that Creative would upgrade at least their jukebox media players &#8211; if not the entire line &#8211; to support the new technology. I&#8217;ve been a happy <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nomadworld.com\/\">Nomad<\/a> customer for years now (I own three Nomads &#8211; the Zen Xtra, a IIc and a MuVo) but my brand loyalty would plummet if I had to buy a new player to use the new service.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I just read this interesting article on subscription services and portable devices.
