<p>Great to hear someone&#8217;s already using <a href="prj_wiki.aspx">DevHawk Wiki</a>. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/">Robert Hurlbut</a> (who&#8217;s working with <a href="http://samgentile.com/blog/">Sam Gentile</a>) <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/posts/10521.aspx">set it up</a> for his team&#8217;s internal use. Great to hear it&#8217;s going well Robert!</p>
<p>I figure there are two primary areas where I am interested in outside collaborative assistance on DevHawk Wiki. First, the WikiRenderer. I imagine as people start using DevHawk Wiki, they are going to want more formatting features. Second, SampleWiki is just that &#8211; a sample. A &#8220;real&#8221; wiki would need to add support for versioning at a minimum. User Authentication, search, multiple back ends (files, DB, etc), and reverse links are some of the other features I&#8217;d like to see. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not particularly interested in enhancing SampleWiki or building a &#8220;RealWiki&#8221;. I built DevHawk Wiki primarily to have the WikiRenderer for another project I&#8217;m working on (more on that later). So I <i>really </i>mean it when I ask for <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/applyjoin.aspx?id=9513f6ed-41c2-4c0f-a5d6-730371bb4b45"> collaborators</a>.</p>
