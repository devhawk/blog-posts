Great to hear someone’s already using [DevHawk Wiki](prj_wiki.aspx).
[Robert Hurlbut](http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/) (who’s working with
[Sam Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blog/)) [set it
up](http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/posts/10521.aspx) for his team’s
internal use. Great to hear it’s going well Robert!

I figure there are two primary areas where I am interested in outside
collaborative assistance on DevHawk Wiki. First, the WikiRenderer. I
imagine as people start using DevHawk Wiki, they are going to want more
formatting features. Second, SampleWiki is just that – a sample. A
“real” wiki would need to add support for versioning at a minimum. User
Authentication, search, multiple back ends (files, DB, etc), and reverse
links are some of the other features I’d like to see.

I’m not particularly interested in enhancing SampleWiki or building a
“RealWiki”. I built DevHawk Wiki primarily to have the WikiRenderer for
another project I’m working on (more on that later). So I *really* mean
it when I ask for
[collaborators](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/applyjoin.aspx?id=9513f6ed-41c2-4c0f-a5d6-730371bb4b45).
