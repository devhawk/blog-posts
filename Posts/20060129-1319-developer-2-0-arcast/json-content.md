FYI, I sat down for an [ARCast with Ron
Jacobs](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/ARCast_with_Ron_Jacobs) last
month to talk about Developer 2.0. It’s not he full presentation I did
at the p&p summit, but it covers much of the same ground. Catch the
[show over on Channel
9](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=153382).
