<p>Shortly after I joined the VS Languages team, we had a morale event that included a <a href="http://www.rockband.com/">Rock Band</a> tournament. I didn&#8217;t play that day in the tournament since I had never played before, but I was hooked just the same. I got <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/rockband">Rock Band</a> for my birthday, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/rockband2">Rock Band 2</a> shortly after it came out in September and I&#8217;m hoping to get the <a href="http://www.rockband.com/games/acdc">AC/DC Track Pack</a> for Christmas.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.rockband.com/music/songs">lots of songs</a> available for Rock Band &#8211; 461 currently available between on-disc and downloadable tracks &#8211; with more added every week. Frankly, there&#8217;s lots of music on that list that I don&#8217;t recognize. Luckily, I&#8217;m also a <a href="http://www.zune.net/software/zunepass/">Zune Pass</a> subscriber, so I can go out and download all the Rock Band tracks and listen to them on my Zune. But who has time to manually search for 461 songs? Not me. So I wrote a little Python app to download the list of Rock Band songs and save it as a Zune playlist. </p>
<p>I ended up use Linq to XML very heavily in this project. Zune playlists use the same XML format as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb249686.aspx">Windows playlists</a>, Zune exposes the backend music catalog via a Atom feeds and I used <a href="http://www.lovettsoftware.com/blogs/blog.aspx?id=56">Chris Lovett&#8217;s SgmlReader</a> to expose the HTML list of Rock Band songs as XML. I realize Linq to XML wasn&#8217;t on &#8220;<a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/11/13/IronPython+And+LtInsert+MSFT+Technology+Heregt.aspx">the list</a>&#8221;, but I had a specific need so it got bumped to the head of the line.</p>
<p>BTW, for those who just want <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Zune/rockband.zpl">the playlist</a>, I stuck it on my Skydrive. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no Skydrive API right now, so I can&#8217;t automate uploading the new playlist every week. If anyone has alternative suggestions or a way to programmatically upload files to SkyDrive, let me know.</p>
