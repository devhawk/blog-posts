I didn\u2019t play that day in the tournament since I had never played before, but I was hooked just the same. I got <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/rockband\">Rock Band<\/a> for my birthday, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/rockband2\">Rock Band 2<\/a> shortly after it came out in September and I\u2019m hoping to get the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rockband.com\/games\/acdc\">AC\/DC Track Pack<\/a> for Christmas.<\/p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rockband.com\/music\/songs\">lots of songs<\/a> available for Rock Band &#8211; 461 currently available between on-disc and downloadable tracks \u2013 with more added every week. Frankly, there\u2019s lots of music on that list that I don\u2019t recognize. Luckily, I\u2019m also a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zune.net\/software\/zunepass\/\">Zune Pass<\/a> subscriber, so I can go out and download all the Rock Band tracks and listen to them on my Zune. But who has time to manually search for 461 songs? Not me. So I wrote a little Python app to download the list of Rock Band songs and save it as a Zune playlist. <\/p>\n<p>I ended up use Linq to XML very heavily in this project. Zune playlists use the same XML format as <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/bb249686.aspx\">Windows playlists<\/a>, Zune exposes the backend music catalog via a Atom feeds and I used <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovettsoftware.com\/blogs\/blog.aspx?id=56\">Chris Lovett\u2019s SgmlReader<\/a> to expose the HTML list of Rock Band songs as XML. I realize Linq to XML wasn\u2019t on \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/11\/13\/IronPython+And+LtInsert+MSFT+Technology+Heregt.aspx\">the list<\/a>\u201d, but I had a specific need so it got bumped to the head of the line.<\/p>\n<p>BTW, for those who just want <a href=\"http:\/\/cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com\/self.aspx\/DevHawk%20Content\/Zune\/rockband.zpl\">the playlist<\/a>, I stuck it on my Skydrive. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no Skydrive API right now, so I can\u2019t automate uploading the new playlist every week. If anyone has alternative suggestions or a way to programmatically upload files to SkyDrive, let me know.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Shortly after I joined the VS Languages team, we had a morale event that included a Rock Band tournament.
