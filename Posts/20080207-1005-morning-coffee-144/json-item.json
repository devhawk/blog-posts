They&#8217;re now at 57 points, taking the lead in the SE division with a full game on Carolina, Atlanta and Florida. Still a ways to go &#8211; 27 games left in the regular season &#8211; and things are far from &#8220;sewn up&#8221; but we&#8217;re a damn sight better off than we were in November. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of a horserace, looks like Clinton and Obama are in one after Super Tuesday. Their <a href=\"http:\/\/tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com\/2008\/02\/your_election_central_delegate.php\">estimated delegate counts<\/a> are basically tied. On the other side of the aisle, McCain <a href=\"http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/23019759\/\">opened up<\/a> what is probably insurmountable lead &#8211; even though he has the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/politicsNews\/idUSN0628190220080207\">right-wing media stars<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnd.com\/news\/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=53743\">Christian leaders<\/a> against him. Money quote of the day:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe real story of the night, when you look at their rallies and their turn-out numbers, is that the Dems have two strong candidates either of whom could lead a united party to victory. Forget the gaseous platitudes: in Dem terms, their choice on Super Duper Tuesday was deciding which candidate was Super Duper and which was merely Super. Over on the GOP side, it was a choice between Weak &amp; Divisive or Weaker &amp; Unacceptable. Doesn\u2019t bode well for November.\u201d <br \/>- <a href=\"http:\/\/corner.nationalreview.com\/post\/?q=NGUyNjRmZGQ2NzBiZjY5OTIwYTExMGVjMWYzZjc2YTY=\">Mark Steyn, National Review<\/a>\u00a0<br \/>(via <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/TheCarpetbaggerReport\/~3\/230563498\/14495.html\">Carpetbagger Report<\/a>, lest you think I regularly read National Review)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Charlie Calvert is starting a new series on the future of C#. First up: <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/charlie\/archive\/2008\/01\/25\/future-focus.aspx\">Dynamic Lookup<\/a>. Probably most interesting is the news that the DLR &#8220;will be the infrastructure on which the C# team implements dynamic lookup&#8221;. Does this mean C# will target the DLR? Sure sounds like it. I think it&#8217;s a good addition, but I&#8217;m not a fan of the proposed syntax. (via <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bittercoder.com\/PermaLink,guid,6525b1f4-42a1-4961-a96c-09aa523bd8c0.aspx\">Bitter Coder<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Brian McNamara saw me present @ LangNET and sent me a link to <a href=\"http:\/\/lorgonblog.spaces.live.com\/\">his blog<\/a>. He&#8217;s building up a monadic parser combinator library in C# 3.0. This is basically the same concept that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quanttec.com\/fparsec\/\">FParsec<\/a> implements, though C#&#8217;s syntax is much less attractive than F#&#8217;s for this kind of code. However, Brian does a very good job explaining why monadic parser combinators are useful and making the idea accessible to the C# programmer (i.e. you don&#8217;t have to learn F# or Haskell to understand what he&#8217;s talking about). He also points to Luke Hoban&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/lukeh\/archive\/2007\/08\/19\/monadic-parser-combinators-using-c-3-0.aspx\">C# 3.0 monadic parser implementation<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I finished Mass Effect last night.
