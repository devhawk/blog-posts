<p>Happy belated July 4th. There&#8217;s a big internal sales conference for Microsoft next week, so I&#8217;ve been spending as much time with my family and not with my computer. But right now I&#8217;m in Phoenix, where it&#8217;s getting into the &#8220;one-teens&#8221;, so there&#8217;s no reason not to blog.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve got 3 new members of the <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=bef1fffe-6d20-42c8-a72d-ae7e9a5a194b"> SPSynd Workspace</a>. It&#8217;s kinda weird since it&#8217;s basically an anonymous system. Do I trust people I don&#8217;t know anything about to have upload rights to the project? In the end, I decided yes, since it&#8217;s under source control. Here&#8217;s my GDN ask &#8211; can we get an activity ranking for members like we do for directories? Or maybe this isn&#8217;t a good idea &#8211; I&#8217;d probably have a very low rank.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve gotten some interest for <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=76e1d3ed-5624-43aa-bd8f-8de5bdcf7100">making workspaces</a> for other projects of mine. I&#8217;ve been a little busy with work (fiscal year ended with June) and family to do this. I also have to check w/ Chris Sells since <a href="prj_messenger.aspx">Messenger.NET</a> is built on his <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#imcli">imcli</a> library.</li>
<li>I joined <a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/JAlexander/">Jason Alexander&#8217;s</a><a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=7adcc4ca-95d8-46bb-bb24-1e4b9eacb858"> nGallery workspace</a>. I have a <a href="http://www.winisp.net/harrypierson/">gallery of baby photos</a> that I built using FrontPage. But I want to turn this into a full fledged ASP.NET app. nGallery looks pretty cool so far, so I&#8217;m looking forward to getting involved. (I haven&#8217;t yet &#8211; see early bullet about having a low member rank)</li>
<li>I&#8217;m listed in an article on MSFT weblogers in the <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/129927_msftblog08.html"> Seattle PI yesderday</a>. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011">Robert</a> gets his picture taken. <a href="http://www.netcrucible.com/blog">Joshua</a> and <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com">Chris</a> get quoted. I get listed as a good place to find other MSFT weblogs. Not glamorous, but it&#8217;s better than nothing I guess. Near the end, the article mentions that MSFT has a hands-off approach to employee blogs. I <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=576cf7cf-8645-49e1-a922-996b698446ec">still don&#8217;t get</a> why this is such a big deal.</li>
</ul>
