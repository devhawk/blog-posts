It&#8217;s kinda weird since it&#8217;s basically an anonymous system. Do I trust people I don&#8217;t know anything about to have upload rights to the project? In the end, I decided yes, since it&#8217;s under source control. Here&#8217;s my GDN ask &#8211; can we get an activity ranking for members like we do for directories? Or maybe this isn&#8217;t a good idea &#8211; I&#8217;d probably have a very low rank.<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;ve gotten some interest for <a href=\"PermaLink.aspx?guid=76e1d3ed-5624-43aa-bd8f-8de5bdcf7100\">making workspaces<\/a> for other projects of mine. I&#8217;ve been a little busy with work (fiscal year ended with June) and family to do this. I also have to check w\/ Chris Sells since <a href=\"prj_messenger.aspx\">Messenger.NET<\/a> is built on his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sellsbrothers.com\/tools\/#imcli\">imcli<\/a> library.<\/li>\n<li>I joined <a href=\"http:\/\/dotnetweblogs.com\/JAlexander\/\">Jason Alexander&#8217;s<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gotdotnet.com\/Community\/Workspaces\/Workspace.aspx?id=7adcc4ca-95d8-46bb-bb24-1e4b9eacb858\"> nGallery workspace<\/a>. I have a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winisp.net\/harrypierson\/\">gallery of baby photos<\/a> that I built using FrontPage. But I want to turn this into a full fledged ASP.NET app. nGallery looks pretty cool so far, so I&#8217;m looking forward to getting involved. (I haven&#8217;t yet &#8211; see early bullet about having a low member rank)<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m listed in an article on MSFT weblogers in the <a href=\"http:\/\/seattlepi.nwsource.com\/business\/129927_msftblog08.html\"> Seattle PI yesderday<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/radio.weblogs.com\/0001011\">Robert<\/a> gets his picture taken. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netcrucible.com\/blog\">Joshua<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sellsbrothers.com\">Chris<\/a> get quoted. I get listed as a good place to find other MSFT weblogs. Not glamorous, but it&#8217;s better than nothing I guess. Near the end, the article mentions that MSFT has a hands-off approach to employee blogs.
