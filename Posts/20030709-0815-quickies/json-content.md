Happy belated July 4th. There’s a big internal sales conference for
Microsoft next week, so I’ve been spending as much time with my family
and not with my computer. But right now I’m in Phoenix, where it’s
getting into the “one-teens”, so there’s no reason not to blog.

-   I’ve got 3 new members of the [SPSynd
    Workspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=bef1fffe-6d20-42c8-a72d-ae7e9a5a194b).
    It’s kinda weird since it’s basically an anonymous system. Do I
    trust people I don’t know anything about to have upload rights to
    the project? In the end, I decided yes, since it’s under source
    control. Here’s my GDN ask – can we get an activity ranking for
    members like we do for directories? Or maybe this isn’t a good idea
    – I’d probably have a very low rank.
-   I’ve gotten some interest for [making
    workspaces](http://devhawk.net/2003/07/01/other-possible-gdn-workspaces/)
    for other projects of mine. I’ve been a little busy with work
    (fiscal year ended with June) and family to do this. I also have to
    check w/ Chris Sells since [Messenger.NET](prj_messenger.aspx) is
    built on his [imcli](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#imcli)
    library.
-   I joined [Jason
    Alexander’s](http://dotnetweblogs.com/JAlexander/)[nGallery
    workspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=7adcc4ca-95d8-46bb-bb24-1e4b9eacb858).
    I have a [gallery of baby
    photos](http://www.winisp.net/harrypierson/) that I built using
    FrontPage. But I want to turn this into a full fledged ASP.NET app.
    nGallery looks pretty cool so far, so I’m looking forward to getting
    involved. (I haven’t yet – see early bullet about having a low
    member rank)
-   I’m listed in an article on MSFT weblogers in the [Seattle PI
    yesderday](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/129927_msftblog08.html).
    [Robert](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011) gets his picture taken.
    [Joshua](http://www.netcrucible.com/blog) and
    [Chris](http://www.sellsbrothers.com) get quoted. I get listed as a
    good place to find other MSFT weblogs. Not glamorous, but it’s
    better than nothing I guess. Near the end, the article mentions that
    MSFT has a hands-off approach to employee blogs. I [still don’t
    get](http://devhawk.net/2003/06/18/microsoft-watch-reloaded/) why
    this is such a big deal.
