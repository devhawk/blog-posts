<p>If you were intrigued by my Software Factories <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=638cf495-f51e-437b-ac7b-26557d980f9b">post last week</a>, you might want to consider attending <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowPage.do?id=Home">OOPSLA &#8217;04</a>. It&#8217;s in Vancouver this year, making it an easy trip from Seattle for me. There&#8217;s going to be an all-day tutorial on <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=141">Using Domain Specific Languages, Patterns, Frameworks and Tools to Assemble Applications</a> presented by the authors of <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0471202843">Software Factories</a>. There&#8217;s also a half-day tutorial on <a href="http://www.program-transformation.org/Gpce/TutorialGP3">Generative Software Development</a> presented as part of the <a href="http://gpce04.gpce.org/">Generative Programming and Component Engineering &#8217;04</a> conference, which is co-located with OOPSLA &#8217;04. OOPSLA will also feature talks by <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=801">Rick Rashid</a>, <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=803">Steve McConnell</a>, <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=802">Ward Cunningham</a> and <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=804">Herb Sutter</a>. And I&#8217;m not quite sure what this is about, but <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowEvent.do?id=806">Jaron Lanier</a> will be presenting a keynote entitled: &#8220;Exocomputing in the Year 2304: A Survey of Confirmed Alien Information Technologies&#8221;. I&#8217;ve got to check that out, if just to see what confirmed alien information technologies look like.</p>
