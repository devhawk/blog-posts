My wife and I moved to Seattle from Los Angeles about 18 months ago. Of
all the things we miss, friends are first on the list. One of those
friends from [USC](http://www.usc.edu/) ([Fight
On!](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls02/bowl?game=orange)) is [Keri
Johnson](http://urbanfamilydog.com/121402/pages/DSCN3681.html). Haven’t
seen him in a while – don’t get back to LA as often as I’d like to – but
I just got email from his band [Urban Family
Dog](http://urbanfamilydog.com/). Keri’s got a voice like you wouldn’t
believe and the
[band](http://urbanfamilydog.com/wallpaper/UFD-Diverse-800x600.jpg) is
awesome. If you like funk and/or horns and are in LA, you’ve got to
[check them out](http://urbanfamilydog.com/mail/1043435085.html) Feb 1st
at the [Key Club](http://www.keyclub.com/) in Hollywood with one of
their main influences: [FishBone](http://www.fishbone.net/)! They have a
[new album](http://www.cdstreet.com/artists/urbanfamilydog/) + lots of
[MP3′s](http://mp3.com/urbanfamilydog) online. Check them out!

UPDATE: The show has moved Feb 8th. Same time, same place, just a
different day.
