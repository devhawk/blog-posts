<p>My wife and I moved to Seattle from Los Angeles about 18 months ago. Of all the things we miss, friends are first on the list. One of those friends from <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">USC</a> (<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls02/bowl?game=orange">Fight On!</a>) is <a href="http://urbanfamilydog.com/121402/pages/DSCN3681.html">Keri Johnson</a>. Haven&#8217;t seen him in a while &#8211; don&#8217;t get back to LA as often as I&#8217;d like to &#8211; but I just got email from his band <a href="http://urbanfamilydog.com/">Urban Family Dog</a>. Keri&#8217;s got a voice like you wouldn&#8217;t believe and the <a class="grouped_elements" href="http://urbanfamilydog.com/wallpaper/UFD-Diverse-800x600.jpg" rel="tc-fancybox-group12">band</a> is awesome. If you like funk and/or horns and are in LA, you&#8217;ve got to <a href="http://urbanfamilydog.com/mail/1043435085.html">check them out</a> Feb 1st at the <a href="http://www.keyclub.com/">Key Club</a> in Hollywood with one of their main influences: <a href="http://www.fishbone.net/">FishBone</a>! They have a <a href="http://www.cdstreet.com/artists/urbanfamilydog/">new album</a> + lots of <a href="http://mp3.com/urbanfamilydog">MP3&#8242;s</a> online. Check them out!</p>
<p>UPDATE: The show has moved Feb 8th. Same time, same place, just a different day.</p>
