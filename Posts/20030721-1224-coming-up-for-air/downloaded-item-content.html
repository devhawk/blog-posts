<p>Wireless access has been available, but time has not. I&#8217;ve at least caught up on my DevHawk email. David Miles ported my <a href="prj_pagelayoutctl.aspx"> Page Layout UserControl</a> project to VB. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/NUnitAddin/">Jamie Cansdale</a> made <a href="prj_messenger.aspx">Messenger.NET</a> into a <a href="http://www.managedaddins.net/gallery/">VS.NET addin</a>. And George Datuashvili and <a href="http://www.douglasp.com/">Doug Purdy</a> both pointed out that the example XML in my <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=a948e2d7-2627-470d-bff6-17618bc87594">XML Schema Doesn&#8217;t Need Inheritance</a> entry is nondeterministic. I&#8217;ve got quite a backlog, but I will get though it later this week.</p>
