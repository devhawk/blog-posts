-   The MSDN folks have a utility for [creating custom help
    files](http://www.codeplex.com/packagethis) from the online MSDN
    library. I didn’t realize MSDN even *had* a [content
    service](http://services.msdn.microsoft.com/ContentServices/ContentService.asmx).
    This is tres useful.
-   Jeff Atwood
    [explains](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000848.html)
    how error-filled the web is and how error-tolerant modern web
    browsers are. I’ve often argued that one of the keys to the rise of
    Visual Basic was because it was tolerant of sloppiness. It’s hard to
    argue with Jeff’s conclusion that “forgiveness by default is what
    works”.
-   [BizTalk Labs](http://labs.biztalk.net/) shipped an update to the
    [Connectivity Service](http://connect.biztalk.net/). It “now
    supports simple publish and subscribe eventing. This allows
    ***multiple clients*** to subscribe to a service and receive
    notifications.” Steve Maine has [some
    details](http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,163e2844-bc01-4f6c-b721-d432666ec966.aspx)
    and a
    [link](http://sessions.visitmix.com/default.asp?event=1011&session=2012&pid=DEV03&disc=&id=1512&year=2007&search=DEV03)
    to the MIX session he did with Don.
-   Larry O’Brein [is
    happy](http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,a3baaf7a-1af3-460a-8486-6b459dab51ed.aspx)
    about IronRuby, but was hoping to see a new Ruby/C\# hybrid
    language. Even though it’s his “\#1 administrative programming
    language”, he specifically hopes for a new language so would “have
    the flexibility to evolve the language.” But Larry, MSFT already had
    an dynamic administrative language that it can evolve! It’s called
    PowerShell…
-   The XNA folks have shipped a [bunch of new
    content](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/04/26/content-update-for-creators-xna-com.aspx),
    including the [Racing Game Starter
    Kit](http://www.xnaracinggame.com/).
-   [Machinima](http://www.machinima.com/) is growing up fast. I just
    discovered [iClone](http://www.reallusion.com/iclone/), a real-time
    3D animation filmmaking tool. You know, my birthday is coming up
    later this month…
