<li>The MSDN folks have a utility for <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/packagethis">creating custom help files</a> from the online MSDN library. I didn&#8217;t realize MSDN even <em>had</em> a <a href="http://services.msdn.microsoft.com/ContentServices/ContentService.asmx">content service</a>. This is tres useful.  </li>
<li>Jeff Atwood <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000848.html">explains</a> how error-filled the web is and how error-tolerant modern web browsers are. I&#8217;ve often argued that one of the keys to the rise of Visual Basic was because it was tolerant of&nbsp;sloppiness. It&#8217;s hard to argue with Jeff&#8217;s conclusion that &#8220;forgiveness by default is what works&#8221;.  </li>
<li><a href="http://labs.biztalk.net/">BizTalk Labs</a> shipped an update to the <a href="http://connect.biztalk.net/">Connectivity Service</a>. It &#8220;now supports simple publish and subscribe eventing. This allows <b><i>multiple clients</i></b> to subscribe to a service and receive notifications.&#8221; Steve Maine has <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,163e2844-bc01-4f6c-b721-d432666ec966.aspx">some details</a> and a <a href="http://sessions.visitmix.com/default.asp?event=1011&session=2012&pid=DEV03&disc=&id=1512&year=2007&search=DEV03">link</a> to the MIX session he did with Don.  </li>
<li>Larry O&#8217;Brein <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,a3baaf7a-1af3-460a-8486-6b459dab51ed.aspx">is happy</a> about IronRuby, but was hoping to see a new Ruby/C# hybrid language. Even though it&#8217;s his &#8220;#1 administrative programming language&#8221;, he specifically hopes for a new language so would &#8220;have the flexibility to evolve the language.&#8221; But Larry, MSFT already had an dynamic administrative language that it can evolve! It&#8217;s called PowerShell&#8230;  </li>
<li>The XNA folks have shipped a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/04/26/content-update-for-creators-xna-com.aspx">bunch of new content</a>, including the <a href="http://www.xnaracinggame.com/">Racing Game Starter Kit</a>.  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.machinima.com/">Machinima</a> is growing up fast. I just discovered <a href="http://www.reallusion.com/iclone/">iClone</a>, a real-time 3D animation filmmaking tool. You know, my birthday is coming up later this month&#8230;</li>
