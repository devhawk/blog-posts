<blockquote><p>And then there is Julie, Harry&#8217;s wife. Every now and then I go over to their place for an incredible dinner. She is a fantastic cook, and I am sure I could maintain a decent weight if I eat reasonable portions, but its <i>sooooo</i> good, I can&#8217;t just have one portion. They keep saying I can come over more often, but thankfully I am in Bellevue, and they are up by the future MS campus in Issaquah. This means that, although the drive is only 10-20 minutes, I have to actively make an effort to go. But when I do go, it is often the highlight of the week.

<p>Thanks Matt! As you can imagine, I share Matt&#8217;s one portion dilemma. The worst is chicken enchiladas &#8211; my wife&#8217;s chicken enchiladas are like crack. I look my empty plate and think &#8220;I could eat one more&#8221; even though I&#8217;ve polished off six already. </p>
<p>I also share his resolution to lose weight. Julie does too, but since she&#8217;s 8 months pregnant, losing weight now would be a bad thing. <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"> </p>
