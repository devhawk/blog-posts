Thanks Matt! As you can imagine, I share Matt’s one portion dilemma. The
worst is chicken enchiladas – my wife’s chicken enchiladas are like
crack. I look my empty plate and think “I could eat one more” even
though I’ve polished off six already.

I also share his resolution to lose weight. Julie does too, but since
she’s 8 months pregnant, losing weight now would be a bad thing.
