  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It's been reported in the Finnish press that if the strike happens then only four of the Finnish NHL players will be playing for their old Finnish clubs until the dispute is over. (This compares with a much greater percentage last time there was a strike).

One reason given was the need for hefty insurance payments together with the lack of money in Finnish hockey (unlikely seeing what they can still pay to some foreign players here together with the high charges for season tickets and normal entrance). 

However my feeling is that then the players needed the money and nowadays with the NHL salaries way up they no longer do and so are just taking the time off.]]></wp:comment_content>
