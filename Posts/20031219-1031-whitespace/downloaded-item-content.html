<p>While checking out the <a href="http://www.sscli.net/servlets/ProjectList">list of projects</a> hosted at the <a href="http://www.sscli.net/">Rotor Community site</a>, I stumbled across an <a href="http://wspcnet.sscli.net/">implementation for Rotor</a> of&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=" http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php">Whitespace</a>&nbsp;&#8220;a programming language whose syntax is entirely based on space (0&#215;20) tab (0&#215;09) and (0x0A) linefeed&#8221;. Seriously.</p>
<p>BTW, the other projects on the Rotor community are much more useful. Check them out.</p>
