While checking out the [list of
projects](http://www.sscli.net/servlets/ProjectList) hosted at the
[Rotor Community site](http://www.sscli.net/), I stumbled across an
[implementation for Rotor](http://wspcnet.sscli.net/)
of  [Whitespace](%20http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php) “a
programming language whose syntax is entirely based on space (0×20) tab
(0×09) and (0x0A) linefeed”. Seriously.

BTW, the other projects on the Rotor community are much more useful.
Check them out.
