Ever since I got back from vacation, it’s been all about the Morning
Coffee. I’m happy to be getting a daily post out, but I haven’t written
anything deep in several weeks now. My one non-MC post in the past two
weeks was [The Virtuous Cycle of Virtual
Platforms](http://devhawk.net/2007/03/06/The+Virtuous+Cycle+Of+Virtual+Platforms.aspx) which
frankly I wrote over a year ago for internal usage and adapted for my
blog after reading [Dare’s
post](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=11c471d6-ea65-4ed2-b387-c9ec966d8418).

One of the reasons for my lack of “deep” posting recently is post
vacation re-engagement. Also, things at work that I can’t blog about
(yet) have been taking my attention. But I worry that this daily MC post
is causing me to focus on “shallow” blog topics. Since I’m trying to
average a post per day, that means at least two non-MC posts every week.
Of course, more than two non-MC posts a week would be just fine.

-   On the XNA Team Blog, Michael Klucher announces the [XNA Game Studio
    Express
    Update](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/03/08/announcing-the-xna-game-studio-express-update.aspx)
    is coming in April. Among the new features are Vista compatibility,
    3D audio, bitmap fonts, game icons and most interesting the sharing
    of compiled XNA games. Currently, the only way to share something
    you build with XNA with the community is by sharing the source code,
    which is less than optimal. For more, check out the [XNA GSE
    Overview
    presentation](http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/0/7/307dd868-9faa-4f6f-8521-0fd5dd7f3902/xna%20game%20studio%20express.zip) by

-   Speaking of gaming consoles, Sony’s [“big”
    announcement](http://kotaku.com/gaming/gdc07/gdc07-sony-unveils-home-242332.php)
    is a Second Life clone? Kotaku thinks “this is going to be one of
    those features that people didn’t realize that wanted until they get
    it.” Personally, I doubt that very much, but what do I know about
    game consoles? I just play, man.
-   Jafar Husain suggests a way to do [Ruby symbols in C\#
    3.0](http://themechanicalbride.blogspot.com/2007/03/symbols-on-steroids-in-c.html).
    Sort of. He defines an extension method that returns the name of the
    property defined in a lambda function. On the plus side, it’s
    strongly typed. On the minus side, “this.GetPropertySymbol(o =\>
    o.Name)” isn’t as easy to type as “:Name”. (via
    [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/csharp/Symbols_in_C_3))
-   While pseudo-symbol support is fairly verbose, Scott Guthrie [goes
    thru](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/03/08/new-c-orcas-language-features-automatic-properties-object-initializers-and-collection-initializers.aspx)
    some of the new language features for terser syntax: automatic
    properties, object initializes and collection initializes. While I
    like object and collection initializes, I’m not really sold on
    automatic properties. Personally, I like the VS prop snippet
    approach, where you automate the creation of the property once time
    when it’s authored rather than leaving the shortcut syntax in the
    code in perpetuity.
