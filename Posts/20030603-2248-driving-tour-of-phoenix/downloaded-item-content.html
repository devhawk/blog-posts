<p>Got to Phoenix only to discover I had left the charger for my <a href="http://pandi.itrc.hp.com/busprod/specifications/0,12513,series=96320^type=^category=,00.html?lsidebarLayId=79&rsidebarLayId=64"> development laptop</a> (otherwise known as my &#8220;portable server&#8221;). Since I&#8217;m here to talk code, maybe having a working laptop is a good idea. (My <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=6709f298-b57e-459b-bb16-b88d555478a5">tablet</a> is going to be a good dev machine, but I haven&#8217;t gotten it entirely configured yet). I drove around a while, looking for a replacement AC adapter. Found what I thought was a <a href="http://www.frys.com">Fry&#8217;s Electronics</a>, but was actually a <a href="http://www.frysfood.com/index.htm">Fry&#8217;s Food &amp; Drug</a>. Luckily, there was a Best Buy nearby. No AC adapter, but they did have the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/content_provider/film/T2DVD.aspx"> T2: Extreme Edition</a> on sale so I picked it up. I eventually found a <a href="http://igo.ententeweb.com/mapfiles/juice.asp">universal AC adapter</a> after visiting two Radio Shacks, but frankly I wanted to check out T2. Unfortunately, the &#8220;player recommendation&#8221; indicate that laptops don&#8217;t play the hi-def version &#8220;due to the amount of data transfer required&#8221;. They weren&#8217;t kidding. But even without being able to watch the hi-def version (<a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=99249bae-9161-4fb8-938d-e167709c9109">for now</a>), it&#8217;s got lots of great features. Audio commentary by James Cameron, lots of new documentaries and on-the-set footage. Favorite toy: the Terminator FX studio. You can import your own photos and either make morph videos into the T1000 or create a &#8220;battle damaged&#8221; T800. I only have pictures of my son with me, so I made a cool, but disturbing, photo of him as a T800 with part of the cybernetics showing through.</p>
