Since I&#8217;m here to talk code, maybe having a working laptop is a good idea. (My <a href=\"PermaLink.aspx?guid=6709f298-b57e-459b-bb16-b88d555478a5\">tablet<\/a> is going to be a good dev machine, but I haven&#8217;t gotten it entirely configured yet). I drove around a while, looking for a replacement AC adapter. Found what I thought was a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.frys.com\">Fry&#8217;s Electronics<\/a>, but was actually a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.frysfood.com\/index.htm\">Fry&#8217;s Food &amp; Drug<\/a>. Luckily, there was a Best Buy nearby. No AC adapter, but they did have the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/windowsmedia\/content_provider\/film\/T2DVD.aspx\"> T2: Extreme Edition<\/a> on sale so I picked it up. I eventually found a <a href=\"http:\/\/igo.ententeweb.com\/mapfiles\/juice.asp\">universal AC adapter<\/a> after visiting two Radio Shacks, but frankly I wanted to check out T2. Unfortunately, the &#8220;player recommendation&#8221; indicate that laptops don&#8217;t play the hi-def version &#8220;due to the amount of data transfer required&#8221;. They weren&#8217;t kidding. But even without being able to watch the hi-def version (<a href=\"PermaLink.aspx?guid=99249bae-9161-4fb8-938d-e167709c9109\">for now<\/a>), it&#8217;s got lots of great features. Audio commentary by James Cameron, lots of new documentaries and on-the-set footage. Favorite toy: the Terminator FX studio. You can import your own photos and either make morph videos into the T1000 or create a &#8220;battle damaged&#8221; T800. I only have pictures of my son with me, so I made a cool, but disturbing, photo of him as a T800 with part of the cybernetics showing through.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Got to Phoenix only to discover I had left the charger for my development laptop (otherwise known as my &#8220;portable server&#8221;).
