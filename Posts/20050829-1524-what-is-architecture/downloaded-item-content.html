<p>So since one of my jobs is to change how we evangelize architecture, I thought it might be good to get some clarity around that term. I doubt there&#8217;s a word more varied in definition in this industry than architecture. I often joke is that we call both the person who sets strategic technology direction for the enterprise and the person who decides whether to use a linked list or an array an architect. Maybe it&#8217;s not that bad, but &#8220;architect&#8221; does appear to have a wide range of definitions. </p>
<p>I once moderated a discussion at the Strategic Architect Forum that featured <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> and this topic came up. Fowler&#8217;s definition of architecture was something along the lines of &#8220;The activities on a project that you do first because you think they&#8217;ll be hard to change&#8221;. He suggested that asking someone to show you their architecture was a sure way to find out the parts of the project they thought most important or were most worried about. While that&#8217;s interesting, I think it&#8217;s harmful to not have a consistent definition of the term across the industry. Everyone knows what a developer does. Nobody knows what an architect does. Well, it seems that way anyway.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because my degree is in engineering, but much of what we call architecture in the computer industry feels more like engineering than architecture. One of the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=architecture">dictionary definitions of architecture</a> is the &#8220;art and science of designing and erecting buildings.&#8221; <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=engineering">Engineering is defined</a> as &#8220;The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems.&#8221; </p>
<p>IMO, building a system that has a set of functional requirements (track customers, process orders, etc) and non-functional constraints (sub-second response time, support 10,000 concurrent users, use Microsoft Windows platform, etc) is an engineering problem. Coming up with the lists of functional requirements and non-functional constraints is the architecture problem.</p>
<p>More on this tomorrow&#8230;</p>
