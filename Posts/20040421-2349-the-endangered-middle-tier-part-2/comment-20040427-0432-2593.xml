  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I can't quote you the exact statistics but I think I can safely say 90% of North American companies are less 100 employees.  With that size of company you should easily be able to host a ERP, SCM or CRM type of app on a single server.
A disproportionate amount of media space is consumed by trying to resolve the scalability issues of Amazon and Google!
Interestingly enough, horizontally partitioned departmental applications, each installed on seperate servers starts to make large companies look like many smaller interoperating companies.
