  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA["While these companies have low scalability need now, as the quantity and quality og 'network enabled applications' and the use of Web Services et al, will make scalability and reusability very important topics for the small enterprise. "

I'm confused!  Why would the quantity or quality of network enabled applications affect the scalabilty requirements of a small business?

Scalability is about the number of transactions, the number of users, the number of clients a company has.

The majority of small companies are not small because they are budding Ebay's that are just waiting for their big break.  Many are small because that's how the like it, some are small because they don't have the management capacity to grow, some are in a business that just naturally doesn't scale.

Most companies don't fail to grow because their IT infrastructure can't handle it.  
Don't get me wrong, some startups have every intention of becoming big, quickly and need to plan for that.  But that is a small percentage of companies.

Trust me when I say that I will not be ordering pizza over the web from a 10 man outfit in lower Slobenia any time soon!
