<p>I finally got my mailbox over to my new office building. One of the things that had collected dust before the switch: a retractable modem cable with a Microsoft product logo on it. I assume they sent it to people in the field to raise awareness of their product. But a modem cable? In the past year, I can count the number of times I&#8217;ve used my laptop&#8217;s modem on one hand. Besides, I have a dozen of these stupid things. </p>
<p>Our group has GREAT giveaways. At an event last year, we gave away <a href="http://www.keyspan.com/products/cables/K-ZIP-CELL-ER/">USB phone chargers</a>. They&#8217;re more common now, but I had never seen one before at the time. We&#8217;ve also given away <a href="http://www.officewisdom.com.au/InnovProd/FireFlyLamp.htm">USB lamps</a> and <a href="http://www.digitallyunique.net/digitally-unique/ceusca12.html"> portable USB webcams</a>.</p>
