It didn&#8217;t get started until 2PM so people could fly in that morning. The event is held @ the MS Conference Center on campus. The MSCC is pretty sterile, like most conference centers, so we bring in comfy furniture, rugs, zen gardens, fountains, plants so the rooms have a much friendlier feel to them. The only technology trappings are that the main meeting room is ringed with shared PCs and we have a ton of power strips strategically placed though mostly out of site under furniture. We also have bookshelves &#8211; the content of which is pretty funny. Mostly knick-knacks and very few books. The one closest to me has two books: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/tg\/detail\/-\/0679764208\/102-8801487-9011317?v=glance\"> Hunting Dinosaurs<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geocities.com\/NapaValley\/1132\/christmas.html#Great Taste Low Fat Holiday Cooking\"> Great Taste-Low Fat Holiday Cooking<\/a>. Interesting choices for an architect event. Of course, we&#8217;re not expecting anyone to sit and read.<\/p>\n<p>We had two keynotes yesterday: Pat Helland and David Campbell. For those following along at home, yes they presented the first two sessions @ the PDC Architecture Symposium. While the content was similar (baring changes Pat made @ 10pm Sunday night to adjust to the new PPT template), the big new addition was the launch of our new &#8220;Metropolis&#8221; metaphor. I hope to get this deck posted to the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/\">architecture center<\/a> soon, but the basic idea is to draw an analogy between the way cities evolved in the late 1800&#8242;s with the advent of the railroad and the ways IT shops will evolve with the advent of the Internet. It&#8217;s a very interesting metaphor that I think we can learn a lot about where we are headed in this industry. More when we get the deck posted.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we are having mostly breakout discussions. Instead of big breakout sessions, a la the PDC, we limit our discussion breakouts to around fifteen customers plus the MSFT speaker, moderator and note taker. Today, I&#8217;m moderating discussions on Envisioning the Service Oriented Enterprise and Microsoft&#8217;s Internal Approach to Enterprise Architecture. I&#8217;ll blog on those later. We also have a keynote by John Shewchuk, architect from the Indigo team. Should be quite a day.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Day one of SAF was great, if short.
