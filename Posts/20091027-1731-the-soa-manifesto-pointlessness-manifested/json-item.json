Video of a \u201cvery formal ceremony\u201d announcing said manifesto. Instead, we just have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.agilemanifesto.org\/background.jpg\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1299\">artistically rendered picture<\/a> of what sure looks like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.martinfowler.com\/\">Martin Fowler<\/a> pointing at a white board while some of the other original signatories look on. Sure, it\u2019s a cool picture, but wouldn\u2019t it have been much cooler if they had captured that moment on video instead? Especially if it was video of them all standing around looking vaguely uncomfortable while photographers took their picture and someone gravely read the manifesto to give it artificially inflated importance. <\/p>\n<p>I only watched ten seconds of the <a href=\"http:\/\/soa-manifesto.org\/\">SOA Manifesto<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TCg16oTZSV0\">announcement video<\/a> before I realized there\u2019s nothing to see here, move along, just a bunch of navel gazing from the <a href=\"http:\/\/thomaserl.com\/\">usual SOA suspects<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Seriously, if you having a big announcement about how cool, earth shattering, significant or, hell, even interesting your manifesto is, then it\u2019s not any of those things. It\u2019s a waste of my time.<\/p>\n<p>Then I noticed that my previous manager and personal friend <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jdevados\/\">John deVadoss<\/a> is one of the signatories. I have metric tons of respect for John, so I gave the SOA Manifesto a second chance. <\/p>\n<p>It lost me at the second sentence. <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Service orientation is a paradigm that frames what you do. <strong>Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a type of architecture that results from applying service orientation. <\/strong>We have been applying service orientation to help organizations consistently deliver sustainable business value, with increased agility and cost effectiveness, in line with changing business needs.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Are you frakking kidding me? \u201cService-oriented architecture (SOA) is a type of architecture that results from applying service orientation.\u201d Who the hell came up with that? I didn\u2019t realize the <a href=\"http:\/\/soasymposium.com\/\">International SOA Symposium<\/a> had a Department of Redundancy Department. <\/p>\n<p>When you define SOA in terms of SO, then you can\u2019t possibly score well on the practicality quotient.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the manifesto isn\u2019t much better. What made the Agile manifesto great IMO was that it ran counter to \u201ccommon\u201d beliefs like \u201cchanging requirements late in the process is bad\u201d and \u201cshipping software cycles should take years\u201d. Sure, we all realize how right those Agile manifesto guys were <em><u>now<\/u><\/em>, but at the time it was the next best thing to heresy for many organizations. Those guys were agents of change. And I mean real change, not \u201cthis will help me sell books\u201d change.<\/p>\n<p>SOA manifesto on the other hand is basically repackaged common sense. Stuff like \u201cRecognize that SOA ultimately demands change on many levels\u201d and \u201cThe scope of SOA adoption can vary. Keep efforts manageable and within meaningful boundaries\u201d Any help figuring out what that change is or what the scope should be? Nope. Thanks for the advice guys, but I had your so called \u201cGuiding Principles\u201d figured out long ago. <\/p>\n<p>But hey, I\u2019m sure the manifesto will help Thomas Erl et. al. sell more SOA books. So, I guess from that perspective it\u2019s mission accomplished.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>You know what the Agile Manifesto doesn\u2019t have?
