  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[While I agree a lot of what you say, there's just a couple of points to consider: First, I would opt for a cluster of two or three of really big servers if you're going to do this. Its too easy for a single failure to take one machine out for too long. Even something as seemingly simple as a network adapter for the backup SAN going out can cause an intolerable downtime in a single server environment. 

Second, you really don't need Yukon to make this work, you could do it with COM+ and MTS. But you'd have to drag me kicking and screaming to such a place. :)

I am anixous to see how such systems really work out.]]></wp:comment_content>
