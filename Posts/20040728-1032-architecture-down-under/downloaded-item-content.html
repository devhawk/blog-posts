<p>I&#8217;m off for New Zealand today. I&#8217;m presenting at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/nz/teched">TechEd New Zealand</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/australia/teched/">TechEd Australia</a>&nbsp;next week. They&#8217;ve got it set up nice &#8211; present in Auckland Friday and Monday, fly to Australia Tuesday, then present in Canberra Wenesday and Thursday. I&#8217;m presenting Metropolis and Data in SOA &#8211; the same talks&nbsp;I did at TechEd US.&nbsp;After that, I&#8217;m off for a week in Sydney with family. Jules &amp;&nbsp;Patrick are coming with, and my mom is meeting up with us in Australia. So things may be pretty slow around here, especially that second week. </p>
<p>In prepration for this trip, I cleaned out my inbox for the first time in, well, ever. Granted, most of it was simply moved to local archive folders, but I did actually throw out everything in my deleted items folders. Typcially, I run bouncing up against my 200 MB mailbox quota. As of yesterday afternoon, I was at 26 MB. I haven&#8217;t had my inbox that empty in five years. Of course, two weeks of unread and unanswered email will fill that up real quick.</p>
