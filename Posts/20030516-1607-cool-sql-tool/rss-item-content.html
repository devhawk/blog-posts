I just added <a href="http://sqlbuddy.sourceforge.net/">SqlBuddy</a> to my tool list. It's an IDE for SQL/MSDE. I've been looking for a low-impact replacement for SQL Server's client tools that handles the &gt;20% of features I need &gt;80% of the time. As Mike @ Larkware <a href="http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind77.html">mentions</a>, it's pretty immature at this point. However, it does have one (potential) killer feature - support for source control. Any changes to code - including changes to the DB - need to be in source control. The reason I say it's a potential killer feature is that so far, it looks like it only has an option dialog for specifying your VSS location - nothing that I see in the IDE supports source control...yet.
