I just added [SqlBuddy](http://sqlbuddy.sourceforge.net/) to my tool
list. It’s an IDE for SQL/MSDE. I’ve been looking for a low-impact
replacement for SQL Server’s client tools that handles the \>20% of
features I need \>80% of the time. As Mike @ Larkware
[mentions](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind77.html), it’s
pretty immature at this point. However, it does have one (potential)
killer feature – support for source control. Any changes to code –
including changes to the DB – need to be in source control. The reason I
say it’s a potential killer feature is that so far, it looks like it
only has an option dialog for specifying your VSS location – nothing
that I see in the IDE supports source control…yet.
