<p>I just added <a href="http://sqlbuddy.sourceforge.net/">SqlBuddy</a> to my tool list. It&#8217;s an IDE for SQL/MSDE. I&#8217;ve been looking for a low-impact replacement for SQL Server&#8217;s client tools that handles the &gt;20% of features I need &gt;80% of the time. As Mike @ Larkware <a href="http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind77.html">mentions</a>, it&#8217;s pretty immature at this point. However, it does have one (potential) killer feature &#8211; support for source control. Any changes to code &#8211; including changes to the DB &#8211; need to be in source control. The reason I say it&#8217;s a potential killer feature is that so far, it looks like it only has an option dialog for specifying your VSS location &#8211; nothing that I see in the IDE supports source control&#8230;yet. </p>
