<ul><li>I'm presenting at a an internal training conference today and tomorrow, so my Morning Coffee roundup posts will be lighter than usual. On the other hand, I'm taking a bus downtown to the convention center, so I might write something more substantial on the way there and back. Or maybe I'll just read.</li><li><a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/">My wife's</a> blogging will also be light, because she's got her nose buried in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545010225">a book</a>. If I do read something to or from the conference, it's not that book because she won't let me near it until she's done! :)</li><li>Speaking of "that book", Werner Vogel drops a few details about how well Amazon handled 1.3 million pre-orders that were delivered on Saturday (including our copy).</li><li>First drop of IronRuby is available. For now, you can get it from <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/07/a-first-look-at.html">John Lam's blog</a>. Unlike <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ironpython">IronPython</a>, IronRuby will be hosted at <a href="http://rubyforge.org/">RubyForge</a>, not <a href="http://codeplex.com">CodePlex</a>, but the site isn't set up yet. Other big news is that the IronRuby team will be accepting external contributions. Are these encouraging signs to the Ruby community? </li><li>More MS Research goodness: a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/da809d0a-2776-4415-8835-4f24832e0f0d/Details.aspx">new drop of Spec#</a> is available. I've <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/08/02/LangNET+Is+Helping+Game+Developers.aspx">written about Spec# before</a>, but haven't had the time to dig into it.Â (via <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1191.aspx">Larkware</a>)</li><li>Scott Hanselman <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BlueBadge.aspx">takes the red pill</a>. Congrats!</li><li>Speaking of Scott, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TaskRemoveAProgrammaticCrutch.aspx">he forwards on advice</a> to remove a programmatic crutch. Good advice. Not to <a href="http://charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html">go all Petzold on Visual Studio</a>, but I would guess the IDE is the biggest crutch out there. As for giving up compulsively checking email, if that's a goal Scott, I think you might have joined the wrong company...</li></ul>
