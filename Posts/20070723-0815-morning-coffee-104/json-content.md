-   I’m presenting at a an internal training conference today and
    tomorrow, so my Morning Coffee roundup posts will be lighter than
    usual. On the other hand, I’m taking a bus downtown to the
    convention center, so I might write something more substantial on
    the way there and back. Or maybe I’ll just read.
-   [My wife’s](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/) blogging will also
    be light, because she’s got her nose buried in [a
    book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545010225). If I do read
    something to or from the conference, it’s not that book because she
    won’t let me near it until she’s done!

-   Speaking of “that book”, Werner Vogel drops a few details about how
    well Amazon handled 1.3 million pre-orders that were delivered on
    Saturday (including our copy).
-   First drop of IronRuby is available. For now, you can get it from
    [John Lam’s
    blog](http://www.iunknown.com/2007/07/a-first-look-at.html). Unlike
    [IronPython](http://www.codeplex.com/ironpython), IronRuby will be
    hosted at [RubyForge](http://rubyforge.org/), not
    [CodePlex](http://codeplex.com), but the site isn’t set up yet.
    Other big news is that the IronRuby team will be accepting external
    contributions. Are these encouraging signs to the Ruby community?
-   More MS Research goodness: a [new drop of
    Spec\#](http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/da809d0a-2776-4415-8835-4f24832e0f0d/Details.aspx)
    is available. I’ve [written about Spec\#
    before](http://devhawk.net/2006/08/02/LangNET+Is+Helping+Game+Developers.aspx),
    but haven’t had the time to dig into it. (via
    [Larkware](http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1191.aspx))
-   Scott Hanselman [takes the red
    pill](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BlueBadge.aspx). Congrats!
-   Speaking of Scott, [he forwards on
    advice](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TaskRemoveAProgrammaticCrutch.aspx)
    to remove a programmatic crutch. Good advice. Not to [go all Petzold
    on Visual
    Studio](http://charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html),
    but I would guess the IDE is the biggest crutch out there. As for
    giving up compulsively checking email, if that’s a goal Scott, I
    think you might have joined the wrong company…
