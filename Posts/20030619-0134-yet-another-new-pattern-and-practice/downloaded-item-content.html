<p>This time it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=28dd3a02-141d-4af0-8828-bfb71b66688a&displaylang=en"> Web Service Facade for Legacy Applications</a>. Unlike many of the other <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/">patterns and practices</a>, this is very lightweight &#8211; a scant 20 pages after you take out the coverage of the included sample application. However, a bigger issue that the lack of content is the definition of &#8220;legacy application&#8221;. This guide discusses three possible legacy apps &#8211; those that expose a COM interface, those that expose a DLL and those in a standalone EXE. However, when my customers talk about legacy apps, they&#8217;re usually referring to apps running on the mainframe. A more relevant guide in this vein would talk about using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hiserver/">Host Integration Server</a> to provide Web Service Facades for mainframe transaction programs.</p>
