This time it’s the [Web Service Facade for Legacy
Applications](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=28dd3a02-141d-4af0-8828-bfb71b66688a&displaylang=en).
Unlike many of the other [patterns and
practices](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/), this is very
lightweight – a scant 20 pages after you take out the coverage of the
included sample application. However, a bigger issue that the lack of
content is the definition of “legacy application”. This guide discusses
three possible legacy apps – those that expose a COM interface, those
that expose a DLL and those in a standalone EXE. However, when my
customers talk about legacy apps, they’re usually referring to apps
running on the mainframe. A more relevant guide in this vein would talk
about using [Host Integration
Server](http://www.microsoft.com/hiserver/) to provide Web Service
Facades for mainframe transaction programs.
