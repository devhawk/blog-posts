<p>Friday&#8217;s Morning Coffee didn&#8217;t happen because I fraked up the DNS settings when I moved devhawk.net to a new registrar. Today&#8217;s morning coffee was drastically delayed on account of car troubles. Tuesday, I have an 8am meeting so tomorrow&#8217;s not looking good either.</p>

<li>The big news for Xbox 360&nbsp;is details on the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0408-im.htm">Spring Update</a>. Big news is WLMessenger integration + a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gamerscore/451798354/">QWERTY thumb pad</a>&nbsp;that snaps right into the controller. (via <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/04/08/543788.aspx">Gamerscoreblog</a> and <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/04/08/details-of-the-may-07-dash-update.aspx">Major Nelson</a>) </li>
<li>Speaking of Xbox, I completed the <a href="http://xboxrewards.msgamestudios.com/challengesandrewards/ChallengeDetail.aspx?id=4">Old Spice Experience Challenge</a>&nbsp;today on my lunch break (couldn&#8217;t go to the office due to the car troubles). My reward is an upgrade to level 2, a gamerpic I&#8217;ll never use and a free copy of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/contraxboxlivearcade/">Contra</a>. (Estimated total value: $5) </li>
<li>Scott Guthrie continues his series on new language features in C#3/VB9. This time it&#8217;s <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/04/08/new-orcas-language-feature-lambda-expressions.aspx">lambda expressions</a>. This is the &#8220;killer&#8221; feature in the new language version IMHO, since you can use lambda expressions either as code or data. Furthermore, it&#8217;s up to the class/method handling the lambda expression to decide if it should be treated as code or data. That decision is made and design time, but the upside is that as a developer, I write my queries exactly the same way regardless if they are to be executed directly (aka code) or analyzed (aka data). Scott also metions a few new LINQ to * projects: <a href="http://linqinaction.net/blogs/main/archive/2006/09/07/Linq_to_Amazon_source_code.aspx">LINQ to Amazon</a>, <a href="http://blogs.magiconsoftware.com/blogs/bdiaz/archive/2007/04/03/implementing-linq-for-nhibernate-part-3-aggregate-and-element-operators.aspx">LINQ to NHibernate</a> and <a href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2007/04/07/the-iqueryable-tales-linq-to-ldap-part-3-why-do-we-need-entities.aspx">LINQ to LDAP</a>. </li>
<li>Speaking of LINQ to *, here&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lukeh/archive/2007/04/03/a-ray-tracer-in-c-3-0.aspx">LINQ to 3D Objects</a> in a C# ray tracer. I think it&#8217;s safe to say that LINQ to *whatever* is the new hotness. (via <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/csharp/Ray_Tracing_in_C_3_0">DotNetKicks</a>) </li>
<li>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/04/06/f-1-9-1-released.aspx">new version of F#</a> is out. Looks like the big new feature is Active Patterns which is described in this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/04/07/draft-paper-on-f-active-patterns.aspx">draft paper</a>. If I only had more time to investigate this. (via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme">Don Syme</a>) </li>
<li>For the third time in the past six months, my laptop power supply has died. I&#8217;ve&nbsp;never had a problem like this before, much less three times. It&#8217;s not even the same laptop as I recently moved over to a Tecra M4 Tablet. I just don&#8217;t get it.  </li>
<li>P&amp;P has shipped the 3.0 release of <a href="http://codeplex.com/entlib">Enterprise Library</a>. Tom Hollander <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2007/04/05/just-released-enterprise-library-3-0-april-2007.aspx">has the details</a>. Personally, I am most interested in the new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2007/02/23/announcing-the-policy-injection-application-block.aspx">Policy Injection Block</a>.  </li>
<li>Having worked with self-signed certificates and understanding what a PITA they are, it&#8217;s nice to see that IIS 7 has <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/04/06/tip-trick-enabling-ssl-on-iis7-using-self-signed-certificates.aspx">explicit support for them</a>.  </li>
<li>I saw a reference to &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Halo-Effect-Business-Delusions-Managers/dp/0743291255">The Halo Effect</a>&#8221; on one of the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/halo-effect-and-efficiency-in-business.html">political blogs I read</a>. Needless to say, as an Xbox gamer, my first reaction was that this had something related to Master Chief. It doesn&#8217;t. </li>
<li>Joe McKendrick compares <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=850">SOA governance to national governance</a>. Given our polarized political climate, this analogy may hurt more than it helps. Also, the next enterprise architectural board that has equal &#8220;branch&#8221; footing with IT and executive management will be the first.</li>
