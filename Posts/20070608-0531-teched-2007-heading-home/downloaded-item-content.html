<p>TechEd isn&#8217;t technically over, but it is for me. I&#8217;m on a flight home in about four hours. Frankly, I am very excited to be going home. It&#8217;s been almost a year since <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/06/26/Gartner+EA+Summit+Day+Two.aspx">my last public presentation</a>, and the only work travel I&#8217;ve done in the last 12 months was that Gartner EA conference last June, the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/09/27/Thoughts+On+The+SOA+Workshop.aspx">Thomas Erl SOA workshop</a> back in September and TechEd 07. I am simply out of practice being gone from home this long. </p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t look like I&#8217;ll be going dark another 12 months before my next public presentation. People must have noticed me stick my head up to do TechEd, I&#8217;ve been asked about presenting at seven conferences that all happen in the next six months. I&#8217;ll do a few &#8211; I hope to gravitate to the ones close to campus and don&#8217;t require me to be gone very long &#8211; but my problem with presenting right now&nbsp;is that I&#8217;m still talking theory. I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/06/15/Moving+On.aspx">left evangelism</a> because I wanted to build something. We&#8217;re still getting started on that &#8220;build something&#8221; thing, so I don&#8217;t have anything to show, just stuff we&#8217;re thinking about building. Hopefully, by conference season next year, I&#8217;ll actually have something to show.</p>
<p>My session yesterday went ok &#8211; I think it could have been better, but the audience seemed to get a lot out of it. It was a larger crowd Monday, but only one customer came up afterwards to discuss the talk with me. Yesterday, I had a half a dozen or so. I&#8217;d post slides for you dear reader, but I didn&#8217;t do any. However, I think on of the sessions I will be doing in the next few months is basically a breakout version of this talk, so I&#8217;ll need slides for that.</p>
<p>The attendee party was almost a bust due to rainstorm. When I got there around 8pm, the word was that <em>all</em>&nbsp;the rides but Spiderman were closed. So I rode Spiderman with a bunch of UK blokes I ended up hanging out with, and by the time we got out the rain had passed and almost everything was open again. Unfortunately, the one thing that didn&#8217;t reopen was Hulk, which I was really looking to ride again. I got to ride it two years ago at TechEd 2005 as part of&nbsp;a special trip the TechEd core team took. But I did get to ride Spiderman, Dueling Dragons, Jurassic Park and Ripsaw Falls (I got drenched) which is pretty much all the big rides but Hulk.</p>
<p>I did take a little time out yesterday before the expo closed to go on a Swag Hunt, mostly to get little trinkets for my kids. I picked up my <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/Evil_Mastermind_Shirts.html">Sourcegear Evil Mastermind</a> shirt on Monday (the only piece of swag I actually wanted). Mostly, it was the usual assortment of little flashlights, yo-yo&#8217;s, and the like. I do want to give a shout out to the <a href="http://www.nsoftware.com/">/n software</a> folks, who were giving away a custom painted Xbox 360 with the Powershell logo. That was cool. Seemed almost every booth had some type of hi-tech gadget giveaway, but that was the coolest by far. They also gave me a copy of their <a href="http://www.nsoftware.com/powershell/">new NetCmdlets</a> product, which Dale has apparently <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/06/07/Morning+Doughnuts+10.aspx">been playing with</a>. The question is, which will Dale be more jealous of: my copy of NetCmdlets or the cool PowerShell sticker I got for my laptop?</p>
