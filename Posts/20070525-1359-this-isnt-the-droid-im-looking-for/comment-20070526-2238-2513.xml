  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Two responses to point #1 above:

First, as I pointed out in my update, Fielding specifically allows the author to choose resource identifiers as they see fit. So I might argue (if it came to down to an argument) that maybe you're not "doing REST" if you can't interop with a REST as Protocol system.

Second, in theory people may find it harder to grok, but in reality are we really worried about that? Is Tim's airline example really that much harder to understand than Atom Publishing? I don't think so.]]></wp:comment_content>
