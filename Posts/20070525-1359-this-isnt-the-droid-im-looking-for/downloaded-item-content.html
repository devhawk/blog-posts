<p>Since David Ing responded to my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/24/REST+Is+Neither+CRUD+Nor+CRAP.aspx">REST/CRUD/CRAP</a> entry&nbsp;<a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=2dbee669-07fd-435e-a5f9-51f709ef183f">on his blog</a>, I guess that means I respond to his response here, right?</p>
<p>Actually, this is going to be very short(*) because I mostly agree with what David wrote. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">If we say stuff like &#8216;REST shall/must replace all foolish WS-* SOAP systems (insert Nelson-style HaHa here)&#8217; then we are just repeating the same lessons as before &#8211; One size won&#8217;t fit all and there is no One Ring to Bind Them illusion in REST as well. If you have something complex that fits the WS-* style then maybe REST isn&#8217;t the droid you are looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this begs the question &#8220;what is complex?&#8221; David described complex as &#8220;long running transaction updating multiple distributed stores&#8221;. Personally, I&#8217;d replace &#8220;stores&#8221; with &#8220;systems&#8221; and I hate term &#8220;long running transaction&#8221; so I would have written &#8220;long running operation&#8221; or &#8220;business process&#8221;, but grammatical nitpicking aside that certainly seems like a fair description. Certainly, most of the scenarios I&#8217;m looking at in my day job could be described as being long running and updating multiple systems. David says later that he thinks &#8220;a lot of apps don&#8217;t need to be modeled that way&#8221;, but I&#8217;m not aware of the alternatives so I&#8217;ll let him expand on this on his own blog. I&#8217;ll try to get to writing about my thoughts around protocol state next week. </p>
<p>I did disagree with this one point:</p>
<blockquote><p>We may <em>say</em> REST is really about a protocol state and not CRUD, but unless the rest of the world gravitates to that view then I&#8217;m afraid it just won&#8217;t be. If, say, through some ongoing groundswell of common usage, people start modelling entities as dereferenceable URI&#8217;s and using POST to do Create and Updates, then REST <em>will</em> be about CRUD by default. This is all very unacademic and unjust, but thems the breaks peachy. The lesson from SOAP is not to fight it by trying to re-educate the masses after they get a perception in their head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it doesn&#8217;t really matter how the rest of the world gravitates, it only matters how you as the the service provider choose to expose your service. If you&#8217;re doing something simple like ATOM publishing, you can probably get away with REST as CRUD. (Would that be hi or lo REST?) If you&#8217;re doing something more complex, either in terms of being long running or needing multiple updates in one atomic operation like <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2007/04/27/47031.aspx">Tim&#8217;s airline example</a>, you&#8217;ll probably need to gravitate towards REST as protocol state. But can&#8217;t the two models can co-exist nicely, even in the same app? No re-education required.</p>
<p>UPDATE &#8211; From <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Fielding&#8217;s Dissertation</a>: &#8220;REST relies instead on the author choosing a resource identifier that best fits the nature of the concept being identified&#8221;. My point exactly.</p>

<p>(*) Wow, this post wasn&#8217;t that short at all. Can you imagine how long this would have been if I had mostly disagreed with David?</p>
