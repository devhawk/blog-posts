<p __designer:dtid="281474976710660">Now that I&#8217;m an <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/01/24/Architect+On+The+Edge.aspx" __designer:dtid="281474976710661">Architect on the Edge</a> (I&#8217;m thinking of putting that on my business card. Good idea or bad idea?) of course the first order of business is taking a closer look at &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;. One thing leaps out at me right away &#8211; I hate the name &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;. </p>
<p __designer:dtid="281474976710662">First off, it&#8217;s a pure marketing buzzword. It was originally coined as a <a href="http://www.web2con.com/" __designer:dtid="281474976710663">conference name</a>. In a way, the fact that is has no underlying meaning is a good thing, because it gives people <a href="http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=88" __designer:dtid="281474976710664">argue</a> whether it <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=805" __designer:dtid="281474976710665">really</a><a href="http://www.scripting.com/2005/12/19.html#busted" __designer:dtid="281474976710666">exists</a> or <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/web_20_is_dead.php/" __designer:dtid="281474976710667">not</a>. In a way, it&#8217;s like the word &#8220;multimedia&#8221; back when we were first putting CD-ROMs into computers. There used to be lots of discussion if one thing or another truly was &#8220;multimedia&#8221;. Now, we don&#8217;t really worry about categorizing it as the marketing buzz around the term is long gone.</p>
<p __designer:dtid="281474976710668">Secondly, I think it&#8217;s wildly arrogant to claim we&#8217;re only on version 2.0. The Internet has been around for 36 years. So everything before mid 2004 was Web 1.0 or earlier? And people are already talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_3.0" __designer:dtid="281474976710669">Web 3.0</a>. Come on, let&#8217;s get real. The technologies that are driving the current revolution have been percolating for more than one major version of the underlying technology.</p>
<p __designer:dtid="281474976710670">Finally, what&#8217;s with the version number anyway? One of the core principles Tim O&#8217;Reilly <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html" __designer:dtid="281474976710671">outlined</a> was the &#8220;End of the Software Release Cycle&#8221;. Why are we using a holdover from the software release cycle days to indicate the end of the software release cycle? </p>
<p __designer:dtid="281474976710672">Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I strongly believe that there is dramatic change happening in this industry. The way I explain my new job is to consider that one of the most basic axioms of distributed computing has been overturned. </p>
<p __designer:dtid="281474976710673">From day one, all the computing power has been focused in the center. At first, the machines on the edge had no power at all &#8211; they were just dumb terminals. Slowly but surely, those machines at the edge started to become powerful in their own right. However, it&#8217;s only in the last seven to ten years that commodity hardware that was pervasive on the edge grew powerful enough to power the center. And it&#8217;s only in the last two or three years that the connection between the center and the edge grew fast and pervasive enough to make that edge power relevant. </p>
<p __designer:dtid="281474976710674">The rules have changed. The power has shifted from the center to the edge. And we&#8217;re only just beginning to see the effects. </p>
<p __designer:dtid="281474976710675">Maybe we should call it WebNT? <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"> </p>
