<p>TechEd is almost upon us &#8211; just over one week to go. We had our last track owner meeting yesterday. I&#8217;m chasing down speakers for slides (I actually have some already!) and figuring out what seems like a million final details for our track cabana. In addition to the great sessions, we&#8217;ve got some cool stuff happening at TechEd this year. Some I can&#8217;t quite talk about yet (watch this space) but I did want to remind all TechEd attendees&nbsp;about the <a href="http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp">Architect Road Rally</a>&nbsp;happening Sunday night, after the precons. Space is limited and subject to first come, first served registration, so <a href="http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp">register</a> right away!</p>
