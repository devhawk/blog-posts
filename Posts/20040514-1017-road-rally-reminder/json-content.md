TechEd is almost upon us – just over one week to go. We had our last
track owner meeting yesterday. I’m chasing down speakers for slides (I
actually have some already!) and figuring out what seems like a million
final details for our track cabana. In addition to the great sessions,
we’ve got some cool stuff happening at TechEd this year. Some I can’t
quite talk about yet (watch this space) but I did want to remind all
TechEd attendees about the [Architect Road
Rally](http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp) happening
Sunday night, after the precons. Space is limited and subject to first
come, first served registration, so
[register](http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp) right
away!
