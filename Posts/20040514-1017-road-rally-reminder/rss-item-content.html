We had our last track owner meeting yesterday. I'm chasing down speakers for slides (I actually have some already!) and figuring out what seems like a million final details for our track cabana. In addition to the great sessions, we've got some cool stuff happening at TechEd this year. Some I can't quite talk about yet (watch this space) but I did want to remind all TechEd attendees about the <a href="http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp">Architect Road Rally</a> happening Sunday night, after the precons. Space is limited and subject to first come, first served registration, so <a href="http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp">register</a> right away!</p>
