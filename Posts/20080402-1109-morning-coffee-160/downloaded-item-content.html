<p>I took most of last week between jobs and have spent much of this week getting machines setup, access to builds, etc. Furthermore, RSS Bandit ate my feedlist and I am still soldiering on sans mobile phone so I was pretty much unconnected for about a week and a half.</p>
<h4>IPy Stuff</h4>
<ul>
<li>Laurence Moroney <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/webnext/archive/2008/03/30/silverlight-dynamic-languages-in-visual-studio.aspx">demonstrates</a> how to configure a web site project in VS08 to use <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/">Dynamic Silverlight&#8217;s</a> development web server Chiron. I looked at turned it into an exported template, but I think the Start Options are stored in the suo file and I&#8217;m not sure how to include that in the template. Maybe it could be set w/ a macro or at worst a GAX recipe?  </li>
<li>If you&#8217;re a regular reader, you might as well get used to the name &#8220;Michael Foord&#8221;. He&#8217;s a developer @ <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/">Resolver Systems</a>, makers of the IPy based <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/products/resolver-one.php">Resolver One</a> app/spreadsheet hybrid I&#8217;ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/01/31/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx">written about before</a>. He&#8217;s also the author of the upcoming <a href="http://www.ironpythoninaction.com/">IronPython in Action</a> book and the maintainer of <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/planet/">Planet IronPython</a> and the <a href="http://www.ironpython.info/">IronPython Cookbook</a>. I&#8217;m going to try very hard to only link to Michael at most once per day. Frankly, that&#8217;ll be tough.  </li>
<li>Today&#8217;s Michael Foord Link: Michael turned his PyCon talk on IPy + SL2 into a series of articles entitled <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2008_03_22.shtml#e949">IronPython &amp; Silverlight 2 Tutorial with Demos and Downloads</a>.  </li>
<li>Ken Levy (who now sits just down the hall from me) <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vsxteam/archive/2008/03/31/ironpython-studio-1-0-for-isolated-and-integrated-vs-shell.aspx">clued me</a> into the 1.0 release of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPythonStudio">IronPython Studio</a>, which is a free IDE based on the VS08 Shell for IronPython (based on code from the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/vsx/">VS SDK</a>). Big new feature in this release is support for the integrated VS08 Shell, which means it&#8217;ll snap into your existing VS08 installation (well, not express) rather than forcing you to install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=ACA38719-F449-4937-9BAC-45A9F8A73822&displaylang=en">300 MB isolated shell</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Stuff</p>
<ul>
<li>Caps had a <a href="http://www2.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=1189&season=20072008&gameType=2">BIG win last night</a> when they needed it most. Now they&#8217;re tied with Carolina for the SE division lead, but they lose the tiebreaker so unfortunately, they can&#8217;t make the playoffs without help. &#8216;Canes have to head back home last night to play Tampa Bay, they have to win tonight and Friday to clinch. Loss in either gives the Caps control of their own destiny. Caps are only one game back of Ottawa, Boston and Philly, none of whom have played well down the stretch. It does mean I have to root for the frakking Penguins to beat Philly, twice. </li>
<li>Now that I&#8217;m in a job where I&#8217;ll be traveling occasionally, I really appreciated Scott Hanselman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/10GuerillaAirlineTravelTipsForTheGeekMindedPerson.aspx">travel tips</a>, though I&#8217;m not sure &#8220;Don&#8217;t look like a schlub&#8221; is in the cards for me. </li>
<li>Unless you&#8217;ve been living under a rock, you&#8217;re probably aware that Scott Guthrie <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/03/21/asp-net-mvc-source-code-now-available.aspx">blogged</a> that the ASP.NET MVC Source Code is <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet">available on CodePlex</a>. The project name is &#8220;aspnet&#8221; not &#8220;aspnetmvc&#8221; which makes me wonder if they might release the source to more ASP.NET stuff over time.  </li>
<li>Speaking of Scott Guthrie, today he blogged about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/04/02/unit-testing-with-silverlight.aspx">unit testing in SilverLight</a>. Jeff Wilcox appears to have the <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/03/31/silverlight2-unit-testing/">definitive post</a> on the subject, including links to the SilverLight testing framework (it&#8217;s included in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=EA93DD89-3AF2-4ACB-9CF4-BFE01B3F02D4&displaylang=en">SL Controls source code release</a>). He also provides a prebuilt &#8220;SilverLight Test&#8221; project template for easy download. Personally, I really like the in-browser test runner. I wonder how hard it would be to hook that up to <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/">DySL</a> so you could write your tests in IPy? (given that IPy doesn&#8217;t have attributes, I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;d be at least a bit of work involved in making this happen)  </li>
<li>Speaking of SilverLight, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/apr08/04-01WM61PR.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases">apparently</a> the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/6-1/default.mspx">next version of Windows Mobile</a> (i.e. 6.1) will support it. Since I&#8217;m in the market for a new phone anyway, I&#8217;m thinking of getting one of these. Also, it&#8217;s nice to see a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/6-1/default.mspx">marketing site for WM 6.1</a> using Silverlight instead of Flash like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/6/default.mspx?WT.mc_ID=wmhome_WM6">WM 6.0 marketing site</a> does.(via <a href="http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2008/04/01/at-ctia-wireless-microsoft-unveils-windows-mobile-6-1-new-version-of-internet-explorer-mobile.aspx">LiveSide</a>) </li>
<li>Ted Neward turns the news that MSFT is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=3356AF19-A36E-4D6D-9D13-C37DB81EE607&displaylang=en">releasing XAML under the OSP</a> into a <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/04/02/Is+Microsoft+Serious.aspx">long and fascinating history lesson</a> that is well worth the read. I&#8217;m going to skip commenting on it, beyond advising you dear reader to read this if you haven&#8217;t already, except to wonder: how many sides does a &#8220;Redmondagon&#8221; have?</li>
