I looked at turned it into an exported template, but I think the Start Options are stored in the suo file and I\u2019m not sure how to include that in the template. Maybe it could be set w\/ a macro or at worst a GAX recipe?  <\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re a regular reader, you might as well get used to the name \u201cMichael Foord\u201d. He\u2019s a developer @ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.resolversystems.com\/\">Resolver Systems<\/a>, makers of the IPy based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.resolversystems.com\/products\/resolver-one.php\">Resolver One<\/a> app\/spreadsheet hybrid I\u2019ve <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/01\/31\/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx\">written about before<\/a>. He\u2019s also the author of the upcoming <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ironpythoninaction.com\/\">IronPython in Action<\/a> book and the maintainer of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.voidspace.org.uk\/ironpython\/planet\/\">Planet IronPython<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ironpython.info\/\">IronPython Cookbook<\/a>. I\u2019m going to try very hard to only link to Michael at most once per day. Frankly, that\u2019ll be tough.  <\/li>\n<li>Today\u2019s Michael Foord Link: Michael turned his PyCon talk on IPy + SL2 into a series of articles entitled <a href=\"http:\/\/www.voidspace.org.uk\/python\/weblog\/arch_d7_2008_03_22.shtml#e949\">IronPython &amp; Silverlight 2 Tutorial with Demos and Downloads<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Ken Levy (who now sits just down the hall from me) <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/vsxteam\/archive\/2008\/03\/31\/ironpython-studio-1-0-for-isolated-and-integrated-vs-shell.aspx\">clued me<\/a> into the 1.0 release of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/IronPythonStudio\">IronPython Studio<\/a>, which is a free IDE based on the VS08 Shell for IronPython (based on code from the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/vsx\/\">VS SDK<\/a>). Big new feature in this release is support for the integrated VS08 Shell, which means it\u2019ll snap into your existing VS08 installation (well, not express) rather than forcing you to install the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyId=ACA38719-F449-4937-9BAC-45A9F8A73822&amp;displaylang=en\">300 MB isolated shell<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Other Stuff<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Caps had a <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.nhl.com\/nhl\/app?service=page&amp;page=Recap&amp;gameNumber=1189&amp;season=20072008&amp;gameType=2\">BIG win last night<\/a> when they needed it most. Now they\u2019re tied with Carolina for the SE division lead, but they lose the tiebreaker so unfortunately, they can\u2019t make the playoffs without help. \u2018Canes have to head back home last night to play Tampa Bay, they have to win tonight and Friday to clinch. Loss in either gives the Caps control of their own destiny. Caps are only one game back of Ottawa, Boston and Philly, none of whom have played well down the stretch. It does mean I have to root for the frakking Penguins to beat Philly, twice. <\/li>\n<li>Now that I&#8217;m in a job where I&#8217;ll be traveling occasionally, I really appreciated Scott Hanselman&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/10GuerillaAirlineTravelTipsForTheGeekMindedPerson.aspx\">travel tips<\/a>, though I&#8217;m not sure &#8220;Don&#8217;t look like a schlub&#8221; is in the cards for me. <\/li>\n<li>Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you\u2019re probably aware that Scott Guthrie <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2008\/03\/21\/asp-net-mvc-source-code-now-available.aspx\">blogged<\/a> that the ASP.NET MVC Source Code is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/aspnet\">available on CodePlex<\/a>. The project name is \u201caspnet\u201d not \u201caspnetmvc\u201d which makes me wonder if they might release the source to more ASP.NET stuff over time.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Scott Guthrie, today he blogged about <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2008\/04\/02\/unit-testing-with-silverlight.aspx\">unit testing in SilverLight<\/a>. Jeff Wilcox appears to have the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jeff.wilcox.name\/2008\/03\/31\/silverlight2-unit-testing\/\">definitive post<\/a> on the subject, including links to the SilverLight testing framework (it\u2019s included in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyId=EA93DD89-3AF2-4ACB-9CF4-BFE01B3F02D4&amp;displaylang=en\">SL Controls source code release<\/a>). He also provides a prebuilt \u201cSilverLight Test\u201d project template for easy download. Personally, I really like the in-browser test runner. I wonder how hard it would be to hook that up to <a href=\"http:\/\/dynamicsilverlight.net\/\">DySL<\/a> so you could write your tests in IPy? (given that IPy doesn\u2019t have attributes, I\u2019m guessing there\u2019d be at least a bit of work involved in making this happen)  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of SilverLight, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/press\/2008\/apr08\/04-01WM61PR.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases\">apparently<\/a> the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsmobile\/6-1\/default.mspx\">next version of Windows Mobile<\/a> (i.e. 6.1) will support it. Since I&#8217;m in the market for a new phone anyway, I&#8217;m thinking of getting one of these. Also, it&#8217;s nice to see a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsmobile\/6-1\/default.mspx\">marketing site for WM 6.1<\/a> using Silverlight instead of Flash like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsmobile\/6\/default.mspx?WT.mc_ID=wmhome_WM6\">WM 6.0 marketing site<\/a> does.(via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.liveside.net\/blogs\/main\/archive\/2008\/04\/01\/at-ctia-wireless-microsoft-unveils-windows-mobile-6-1-new-version-of-internet-explorer-mobile.aspx\">LiveSide<\/a>) <\/li>\n<li>Ted Neward turns the news that MSFT is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyId=3356AF19-A36E-4D6D-9D13-C37DB81EE607&amp;displaylang=en\">releasing XAML under the OSP<\/a> into a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/04\/02\/Is+Microsoft+Serious.aspx\">long and fascinating history lesson<\/a> that is well worth the read. I\u2019m going to skip commenting on it, beyond advising you dear reader to read this if you haven\u2019t already, except to wonder: how many sides does a \u201cRedmondagon\u201d have?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I took most of last week between jobs and have spent much of this week getting machines setup, access to builds, etc. Furthermore, RSS Bandit ate my feedlist and I am still soldiering on sans mobile phone so I was pretty much unconnected for about a week and a half.
