<p>My pal Chris <a href="http://blahgkarma.blogspot.com/">started a blog</a> over the weekend - I've been <a href="http://blahgkarma.blogspot.com/2004/12/welcome.html">bugging him</a> to do so for quite a while. I've know Chris for several years - he used to be an officer in a company that I helped migrate over to .NET. The company got sold, but Chris hasn't blogged what he does now so I'm not going to spoil the surprise (hint - he did blog about <a href="http://blahgkarma.blogspot.com/2004/12/all-i-want-for-christmas-is.html">automatic external defibrillators</a>). </p><p>So far, Chris is doing a lot of ranting - his <a href="http://blahgkarma.blogspot.com/2004/12/i-miss-obyrnes-pub.html">favorite pub in Edmonton</a> (which I've been to), <a href="http://blahgkarma.blogspot.com/2004/12/amazon-amazing.html">Amazon Theater</a>, and <a href="http://blahgkarma.blogspot.com/2004/12/tis-season-for-ripoff.html">reselling livestrong bracelets</a>. Personally, I think it's funny that <a href="http://blahgkarma.blogspot.com/2004/12/little-good-karma-anyone.html">Chris can build</a> a <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/115/2519/200/5.jpg">wearyellow livestrong flair</a> for his blog template, but <a href="http://blahgkarma.blogspot.com/2004/12/syndication.html">he hasn't built</a> an XML flair that points to his <a href="http://blahgkarma.blogspot.com/atom.xml">syndication feed</a>. </p><p>Chop busting aside, I'm glad to see Chris posting. When I first met Chris, I was transitioning from consultant to technical sales, and I've learned a bunch from Chris about how business works that has come in very handy now that I work with architects. Chris, can't wait to see more from you. But when are you coming to Seattle for a visit?</p>
