I&#8217;ve know Chris for several years &#8211; he used to be an officer in a company that I helped migrate over to .NET. The company got sold, but Chris hasn&#8217;t blogged what he does now so I&#8217;m not going to spoil the surprise (hint &#8211; he did blog about <a href=\"http:\/\/blahgkarma.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/all-i-want-for-christmas-is.html\">automatic external defibrillators<\/a>). <\/p>\n<p>So far, Chris is doing a lot of ranting &#8211; his <a href=\"http:\/\/blahgkarma.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/i-miss-obyrnes-pub.html\">favorite pub in Edmonton<\/a> (which I&#8217;ve been to), <a href=\"http:\/\/blahgkarma.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/amazon-amazing.html\">Amazon Theater<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/blahgkarma.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/tis-season-for-ripoff.html\">reselling livestrong bracelets<\/a>. Personally, I think it&#8217;s funny that <a href=\"http:\/\/blahgkarma.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/little-good-karma-anyone.html\">Chris can build<\/a> a <a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/img\/115\/2519\/200\/5.jpg\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group489\">wearyellow livestrong flair<\/a> for his blog template, but <a href=\"http:\/\/blahgkarma.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/syndication.html\">he hasn&#8217;t built<\/a> an XML\u00a0flair that points to his <a href=\"http:\/\/blahgkarma.blogspot.com\/atom.xml\">syndication feed<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Chop busting aside, I&#8217;m glad to see Chris posting. When I first met Chris, I was transitioning from consultant to technical sales, and I&#8217;ve learned a bunch from Chris about how business works that has come in very handy now that I work with architects. Chris, can&#8217;t wait to see more from\u00a0you. But when are you coming to Seattle for a visit?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>My pal Chris started a blog over the weekend -\u00a0I&#8217;ve been bugging him to do so for quite a while.
