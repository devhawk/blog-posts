  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[RSS didn't make sense for a lot of reasons. We were paving cowpaths, and RSS for playlists was very much not a cowpath. Playlists are about sequence, while RSS has no concept of sequence except reverse chronological order. We needed abstractions to deal with the fact that music and movies frequently don't have URLs, and RSS didn't have them. If not starting from scratch was critical, HTML preceded RSS and would be the default to work from. ]]></wp:comment_content>
