<p>Marc Canter seems pretty excited that Songbird is going to support XSPF. While Marc has written about it many times, I had no idea what it was. It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.xspf.org/">XML Shareable Playlist Format</a> (pronounced &#8220;spiff&#8221;). It&#8217;s designed to be simple and open and built on XML. Typically, that&#8217;s coolness but while reading the <a href="http://www.xspf.org/xspf-v1.html">spec</a>, I had a strong sense of deja-vu. XSPF defines a list of songs for a playlist, much the same way that <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-2-0">RSS</a> defines a list of blog entries. </p>
<p>So that begs the question, why didn&#8217;t XSPF just use RSS instead of starting from scratch? RSS is simple, open, built on XML and is massively popular? Remember when Adam Bosworth that <a href="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=337&page=4">pointed out</a> that RSS and Atom are &#8220;both support a base schema that provides a model for sets&#8221;. I&#8217;m all for a simple, open and extensible playlist format, but I&#8217;m not excited that XSPF has gone of an reinvented the concept of &#8220;list&#8221; in order to do it. </p>
