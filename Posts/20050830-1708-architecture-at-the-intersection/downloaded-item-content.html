<p><a href="http://www.rgoarchitects.com/blog">Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz</a> left a <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,1629f5d2-1504-436c-aa43-91419955fb5d.aspx">comment</a> yesterday disagreeing with my characterization of engineering vs. architecture problems:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t say I totally agree that it is the software architect&#8217;s role to come up with the list of functional requirements. That&#8217;s what business analysts or requirement engineers do. The role of the architect is to identify which requirements are important and to surface the significant quality attributes (non-functional requirements) of the system (again, the architect is not the source of the quality attributes but his role is to determine which the most important ones are). </p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad Arnon responded. His blog looks pretty interesting and he&#8217;s working with Architect MVP <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/">Udi Dahan</a>. Subscribed. </p>
<p>However, I wasn&#8217;t talking about architects, I was talking about architecture. That may seem like a subtle difference, but between the wide variance in the definition of architecture and the wide variance in types of companies, trying to figure out a general description of architect across all that variance seems like chasing your tail. </p>
<p>So with that in mind, here&#8217;s an interesting distinction between building architects and engineers. I think Pat Helland told me this, but I forget. If you know the origin of this comment, please <a href="mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com">drop me a line</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Engineering is about walls. Architecture is about the space between the walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love that distinction. That leads to my personal definition about architecture in the enterprise and/or software realm:</p>
<blockquote><p>Architecture is the intersection between business and IT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Most</i> of what I see passed off as architecture lives purely in the realm of IT. For example, as much as I like <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Fowler&#8217;s</a><a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/books.html#eaa">PoEAA</a>, I would argue that those are engineering patterns as they have little to do with business. If you&#8217;re building a system for an enterprise, there&#8217;s a business driver funding that system construction. The business folks don&#8217;t really care which domain logic or data access patterns you use. <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html">Domain Model</a> vs. <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/tableModule.html">Table Module</a>? <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/tableDataGateway.html">Table Data Gateway</a> vs. <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/rowDataGateway.html">Row Data Gateway</a>? Come on, you think business people care about that?</p>
<p>If a decision doesn&#8217;t effect a business person, it&#8217;s not an architecture decision. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s not important &#8211; I think the role of the software engineer is critical in large-scale enterprise system design and construction. And I will readily admit that often a single person is responsible for both architecture and engineering. But that doesn&#8217;t make them the same activity. As long as we continue to confuse the two disciplines, we hold them both back. </p>
<p>Tomorrow, who&#8217;s doing all this architecting?</p>
