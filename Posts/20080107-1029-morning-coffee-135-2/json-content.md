-   Bill Gates does his last [CES](http://www.microsoft.com/ces)
    Keynote, and we announce a PC that [looks like a
    purse](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2008/jan08/01-07fashionpcs.mspx)?
-   News that Warner Brothers is [going exclusively
    Blu-Ray](http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/boost-for-blu-ray-warner-bros-will-release-high-def-titles-exclusively-in-that-format/)
    is disappointing. However, I’m convinced that neither side will win
    this format war but that online downloads will trump both.
    Obviously, [XBLM](http://www.xbox.com/live/marketplace/moviestv) is
    a significant player in this space, but the market is crowding up
    quickly. Netflix apparently will [unveil a new set-top
    box](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/netflix-lg-team-up-bring/story.aspx?guid=%7B524C1C79-666C-49FD-AD1A-75E4D3B5878B%7D)
    @ CES to let you watch HD movies via the Internet.
-   Don Syme has a [roundup of
    posts](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/01/05/learning-wpf-through-f-and-vice-versa-by-john-liao.aspx)
    by [John Liao](http://jyliao.blogspot.com) about F\#. Mostly, WPF +
    F\# with a couple of ASP.NET 2.0 posts and one on XML .
-   Speaking of F\#, Stephan Tolksdorf has been working on an F\# port
    of MS Research’s [Parsec
    library](http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/parsec.html)
    called [FParsec](http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/index.html). Parsec
    is a “monadic parser combinator library”, something I have little
    experience with, so I’ve gone back to some [source
    research](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh//monparsing.pdf) on the
    topic, which I hope to blog at length about soon.
-   Steve Vinoski talks about serendipitous reuse in his latest
    [Internet Computing
    article](http://computer.org/portal/pages/dsonline/2008/02/w1tow.xml).
    I’m not a believer in reuse in the enterprise, serendipitous or
    otherwise, but I liked the conclusion to Steve’s article when he
    wrote “It’s highly ironic that many enterprise architects seek to
    impose centralized control over their distributed organizations. In
    many cases, such centralization is a sure recipe for failure.” Also,
    his point that “control without controlling” works sounds [vaguely
    familiar](http://devhawk.net/2007/10/25/The+Worst+Of+Both+Worlds.aspx).
-   Update – This is really Morning Coffee 136, but I don’t want to
    change the title since it’s part of the URL
