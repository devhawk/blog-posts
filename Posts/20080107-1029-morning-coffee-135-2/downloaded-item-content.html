<li>Bill Gates does his last <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ces" target="_blank">CES</a> Keynote, and we announce a PC that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2008/jan08/01-07fashionpcs.mspx" target="_blank">looks like a purse</a>? </li>
<li>News that Warner Brothers is <a href="http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/boost-for-blu-ray-warner-bros-will-release-high-def-titles-exclusively-in-that-format/" target="_blank">going exclusively Blu-Ray</a> is disappointing. However, I&#8217;m convinced that neither side will win this format war but that online downloads will trump both. Obviously, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/live/marketplace/moviestv" target="_blank">XBLM</a> is a significant player in this space, but the market is crowding up quickly. Netflix apparently will <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/netflix-lg-team-up-bring/story.aspx?guid=%7B524C1C79-666C-49FD-AD1A-75E4D3B5878B%7D" target="_blank">unveil a new set-top box</a> @ CES to let you watch HD movies via the Internet. </li>
<li>Don Syme has a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/01/05/learning-wpf-through-f-and-vice-versa-by-john-liao.aspx" target="_blank">roundup of posts</a> by <a href="http://jyliao.blogspot.com" target="_blank">John Liao</a> about F#. Mostly, WPF + F# with a couple of ASP.NET 2.0 posts and one on XML . </li>
<li>Speaking of F#, Stephan Tolksdorf has been working on an F# port of MS Research&#8217;s <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/parsec.html" target="_blank">Parsec library</a> called <a href="http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/index.html" target="_blank">FParsec</a>. Parsec is a &#8220;monadic parser combinator library&#8221;, something I have little experience with, so I&#8217;ve gone back to some <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh//monparsing.pdf" target="_blank">source research</a> on the topic, which I hope to blog at length about soon. </li>
<li>Steve Vinoski talks about serendipitous reuse in his latest <a href="http://computer.org/portal/pages/dsonline/2008/02/w1tow.xml" target="_blank">Internet Computing article</a>. I&#8217;m not a believer in reuse in the enterprise, serendipitous or otherwise, but I liked the conclusion to Steve&#8217;s article when he wrote &#8220;It&#8217;s highly ironic that many enterprise architects seek to impose centralized control over their distributed organizations. In many cases, such centralization is a sure recipe for failure.&#8221; Also, his point that &#8220;control without controlling&#8221; works sounds <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/10/25/The+Worst+Of+Both+Worlds.aspx" target="_blank">vaguely familiar</a>.</li>
<li>Update &#8211; This is really Morning Coffee 136, but I don&#8217;t want to change the title since it&#8217;s part of the URL</li>
