I just got a chance to check out the [latest Coding4Fun
article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun05302003.asp)
on MSDN. The article is about writing macros for VS.NET and one of the
examples in the article shows how to build a macro to insert regions
into your code by selection. What a great idea! Why didn’t I think of
that? :wink:

Seriously, thanks [Duncan](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma) for the link
to my [region insertion macro](art_addregion.aspx) and for calling it
“much more detailed”. It wouldn’t be without Richard Childress, John St.
Clair, [Yves Hanoulle](http://www.hanoulle.be/) and [Tim
Walters](http://dotnetweblogs.com/TWalters/) who contributed bug fixes,
support for VB.NET and undo contexts.
