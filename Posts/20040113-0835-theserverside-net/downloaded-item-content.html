<p>The <a href="http://www.middleware-company.com/">Middleware Company</a> has launched <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/">TheServerSide .NET</a>, a community for enterprise .NET development. Of course, it&#8217;s a complement to their existing enterprise Java site simply called <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/">TheServerSide</a>. Generally, <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.jsp?thread_id=23253">the reaction</a> on TheServerSide to the new .NET site is positive &#8211; only one negative comment as I blog this.</p>
<p>Various teams at Microsoft are contributing content. There&#8217;s a smart client <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/studies/study.aspx?l=ThomsonOne">case study</a> from a project my by team. Patterns and Practices have a <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/booksinreview/pag.aspx">public book review</a>. And there are <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/talks/index.aspx">tech talks</a> from Don Box and Scott Guthrie. Look for more in the future.</p>
<p>Other great content on the site includes an <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/articles/article.aspx?l=UnitTesting">article on unit testing</a>, a <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/talks/library.aspx#NatarajanJaneva">tech talk</a> from a Borland engineer and an <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/articles/article.aspx?l=AutonomousServices">article on autonomous services</a>. </p>
<p>Major congrats to Floyd Marinescu (GM of Server Side Communities) and <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/articles/article.aspx?l=Welcome">Ted Neward</a> (Editor in Chief of TSS.NET). Looks like it&#8217;s going to be a great site &#8211; though the sign up process seems to have a few bugs in it this morning.</p>
