Two new architect bloggers to note. [Jim
Clark](http://blogs.msdn.com/jimclark) is a business architect on the
Architecture Strategy Team. Jim spends a lot of time with what he calls
“Red River” – identification and definition of business architectures,
ontologies and environments that promote trusted business solutions. His
first post is about [Familiarity and
Trust](http://blogs.msdn.com/jimclark/archive/2004/10/11/240905.aspx).
[Steve Cook](http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook) is a contributor to
[Software Factories](http://www.softwarefactories.com/TheBook.html) and
works for Keith. Steve is [looking forward to
OOPSLA](http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook/archive/2004/10/13/241843.aspx).
So am I.
