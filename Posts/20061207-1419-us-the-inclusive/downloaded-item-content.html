<p>With the real and serious problem we face in this country &#8211; the civil war in Iraq, the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, rebuilding New Orleans, etc.&nbsp;- it boggles the mind that we waste any time at all on faux controversies such as the so-called &#8220;War on Christmas&#8221;. Getting <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=2642061">Wal-Mart</a> to use &#8220;Christmas&#8221; instead of &#8220;Holiday&#8221; in their marketing seems like a dubious accomplishment at best. </p>
<p>But where I rail against such stupidity, my brilliant <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/">wife</a> writes poetry. One of Julie&#8217;s conservative friends sent her an insipid&nbsp;poem that&#8217;s been making the rounds on the Internet called &#8220;How The &#8216;Left&#8217; Stole Christmas&#8221;. I must have missed Wolf Blitzer changing his name to &#8220;Wolf Blitzen&#8221; or the Senate passing legislation to take away Christian&#8217;s faith and forbid them to speak of salvation and grace. </p>
<p>My response would have simply been &#8220;Read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">First Amendment</a>, idiot!&#8221;. My wife, however, wrote a <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!552.entry">poem of her own in response</a>. Check it out. </p>
