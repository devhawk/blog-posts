Getting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.abcnews.go.com\/Business\/wireStory?id=2642061\">Wal-Mart<\/a> to use &#8220;Christmas&#8221; instead of &#8220;Holiday&#8221; in their marketing seems like a dubious accomplishment at best. <\/p>\n<p>But where I rail against such stupidity, my brilliant <a href=\"http:\/\/techiewife.spaces.live.com\/\">wife<\/a> writes poetry. One of Julie&#8217;s conservative friends sent her an insipid\u00a0poem that&#8217;s been making the rounds on the Internet called &#8220;How The &#8216;Left&#8217; Stole Christmas&#8221;.
