<p>I normally keep this blog clear of personal and political commentary, saving that talk for my <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/devhawk">personal blog on MSN Spaces</a>. But this time I had to make an exception. Check out this awesome picture of my daughter Rileyanne in a field of buttercups. Isn&#8217;t she cute? <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group749" alt=":)"> </p>
