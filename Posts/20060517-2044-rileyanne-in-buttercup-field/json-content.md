I normally keep this blog clear of personal and political commentary,
saving that talk for my [personal blog on MSN
Spaces](http://spaces.msn.com/devhawk). But this time I had to make an
exception. Check out this awesome picture of my daughter Rileyanne in a
field of buttercups. Isnâ€™t she cute?
