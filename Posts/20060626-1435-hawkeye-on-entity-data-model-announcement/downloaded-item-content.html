<p>My pal <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/timmall">Tim</a> dropped me an email last week to let me know they (the ADO.NET team) were publishing their <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dataaccess/archive/2006/06/20/638378.aspx">vNext vision around entities</a>. Of course, they picked the week when I&#8217;m in San Diego! So I didn&#8217;t get a chance to look at it until today. In a nutshell, they are raising the level of abstraction for databases. Regular DevHawk readers know I talk about <a href="http://devhawk.net/SearchView.aspx?q=abstraction">abstraction</a> a lot around here. In fact, one of my earliest posts on this blog &#8211; 1 house, 2 kids and 5 jobs ago &#8211; was on <a class="TitleLinkStyle" href="http://devhawk.net/2003/01/17/Disruptive+Programming+Language+Technologies.aspx">Disruptive Programming Language Technologies</a>. So this is a topic near and dear to my heart. </p>
<p>This is an amazingly good thing. Think of the impact VB had on the development industry, but bigger. The abstraction level of databases hasn&#8217;t been raised in decades. It&#8217;s about freaking time we did.</p>
<p>My only problem with the article is that it&#8217;s pretty obtuse. Referring to this as &#8220;Making the Conceptual Level Real&#8221; makes it sound much less exciting than it really is. Nobody refers to C# as a &#8220;conceptual&#8221; programming language. But if you use the terminology from the vision article, that&#8217;s exactly what it is. Machine code is the physical level, IL is the logical layer and C# would then be the conceptual layer. But lets say you build a compiler that compiles C# directly to machine code. Would it suddenly become the logical layer? Who knows? Who cares? Let&#8217;s just raise the level of abstraction and not get all caught up naming the level we&#8217;re currently at.</p>
<p>VB was introduced <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2006/05/24/12200.aspx">15 years ago</a> in 1991. Most developers in the industry are aware and remember the impact VB had (if you don&#8217;t, check out <a href="http://ftponline.com/weblogger/forum.aspx?id=18">Billy Hollis</a>&#8216; <a href="http://dotnetmasters.com/historyofbasic.htm">History of BASIC</a>). The relational model was <a href="http://www.acm.org/classics/nov95/toc.html">introduced 36 years ago</a>, The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics_Relational_Data_Store">first RDBMS</a> was introduced in 28 years ago. I&#8217;d bet the majority of developers in the industry today don&#8217;t remember a time before databases. Hell, I was introduced 36 years old myself. (I&#8217;m sure my dad remembers programming before databases, but he doesn&#8217;t code much these days.)</p>
<p>As I said, this is going to be big and it&#8217;s about freaking time. So hats off to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dataaccess/default.aspx">ADO.NET team</a>. Can&#8217;t wait to see this running. <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=488135&SiteID=1">According to this</a>, first CTP drop is August, so you don&#8217;t even have to wait too long. </p>
