<p>Based on the feedback I&#8217;ve gotten since my <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/KEY01#time=1h35m39s">keynote appearance @ Build</a> &#8211; both in person and via email &amp; twitter &#8211; there are a lot of folks who are excited about the Brokered WinRT Component feature. However, I&#8217;ve been advising folks to hold off a bit until the new VS templates were ready. Frankly, the developer experience for this feature is a bit rough and the VS template makes the experience much better. Well, hold off no longer! My old team has published the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/527286e4-b06a-4234-adde-d313c9c3c23e">Brokered WinRT Component Project Templates</a> up on the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio Gallery</a>!</p>
<p>Now that the template is available, I&#8217;ve written a step-by-step guide demonstrating how to build a &#8220;Hello World&#8221; style brokered component. Hopefully, this will help folks in the community take advantage of this cool new feature in Windows 8.1 Update.</p>
<p>To keep it readable, I&#8217;ve broken it into three separate posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://devhawk.net/2014/04/25/brokered-winrt-components-step-one">Step&nbsp;One &#8211; Build the brokered WinRT component</a></li>
<li><a href="http://devhawk.net/2014/04/25/brokered-winrt-components-step-two">Step&nbsp;Two &#8211; Build the proxy/stub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://devhawk.net/2014/04/25/brokered-winrt-components-step-three">Step&nbsp;Three &#8211; Build the client WinRT app</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note, this walkthrough assumes you&#8217;re running Windows 8.1 Update, Visual Studio 2013 with <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/2014-apr-2-vs#VS2013Update2RC">Update 2 RC</a> (or later) and the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/527286e4-b06a-4234-adde-d313c9c3c23e">Brokered WinRT Component Project Templates</a> installed.</p>
