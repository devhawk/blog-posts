However, I\u2019ve been advising folks to hold off a bit until the new VS templates were ready. Frankly, the developer experience for this feature is a bit rough and the VS template makes the experience much better. Well, hold off no longer! My old team has published the <a href=\"http:\/\/visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com\/527286e4-b06a-4234-adde-d313c9c3c23e\">Brokered WinRT Component Project Templates<\/a> up on the <a href=\"http:\/\/visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com\/\">Visual Studio Gallery<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Now that the template is available, I\u2019ve written a step-by-step guide demonstrating how to build a \u201cHello World\u201d style brokered component. Hopefully, this will help folks in the community take advantage of this cool new feature in Windows 8.1 Update.<\/p>\n<p>To keep it readable, I\u2019ve broken it into three separate posts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2014\/04\/25\/brokered-winrt-components-step-one\">Step\u00a0One \u2013 Build the brokered WinRT component<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2014\/04\/25\/brokered-winrt-components-step-two\">Step\u00a0Two \u2013 Build the proxy\/stub<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2014\/04\/25\/brokered-winrt-components-step-three\">Step\u00a0Three \u2013 Build the client WinRT app<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note, this walkthrough assumes you\u2019re running Windows 8.1 Update, Visual Studio 2013 with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visualstudio.com\/en-us\/news\/2014-apr-2-vs#VS2013Update2RC\">Update 2 RC<\/a> (or later) and the <a href=\"http:\/\/visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com\/527286e4-b06a-4234-adde-d313c9c3c23e\">Brokered WinRT Component Project Templates<\/a> installed.<\/p>\n<p>I hope this series helps you take advantage of brokered WinRT components.
