The last session I went to @ PDC on Wed was on [Building Media Center
Applications](http://www.mymsevents.com/MyMSEvents/search.aspx?s=1&keywords=CLI360&keywordtype=1)
([PPT](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/PDC/4278/CLI360.ppt)). You can
download the [MCE
SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=11184DC4-EF15-4973-A945-57D7C7CED518&displaylang=en)
from the [MCE Developer
Center](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/developer/) which
isnâ€™t on MSDN (go figure).
