[Jeff Schlimmer](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/jeffsch) has [the
latest](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/jeffsch/default.aspx?key=2003-06-12T08:43:15Z)
on the new [drafts of WSDL 1.2](http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/desc/). Given
my [general
issues](http://devhawk.net/2003/01/20/wsdl-soapaction-issues/) with
WSDL, Iâ€™m very excited about the changes. Port Type -\> Interface.
Service/Port -\> Service/End Point. Plus a whole new document on message
patterns. Want to read, but for now, I must sleep.
