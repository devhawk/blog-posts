<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/jeffsch">Jeff Schlimmer</a> has <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/jeffsch/default.aspx?key=2003-06-12T08:43:15Z"> the latest</a> on the new <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/desc/">drafts of WSDL 1.2</a>. Given my <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=c2eeb3f8-ca88-4627-bea7-ec49e75f0a1f">general issues</a> with WSDL, I'm very excited about the changes. Port Type -&gt; Interface. Service/Port -&gt; Service/End Point. Plus a whole new document on message patterns. Want to read, but for now, I must sleep.
