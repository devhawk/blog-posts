<p>It&#8217;s been a while &#8211; and a team name change -&nbsp;but another one of my teammates has made the leap into the blogosphere. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon">John Evdemon</a> is a member of our vertical industry architecture team focusing on near and long term web service solutions as well as regulatory compliance solutions. Furthermore, he&#8217;s a co-chair of the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsbpel">OASIS BPEL TC</a>. He <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2004/06/09/152347.aspx">blogged a presentation</a> on BPEL he did at SD West. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/Rss.aspx">Subscribed</a> and added to my list of <a href="http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx">Architecture Strategy and Evangelist Blogs</a></p>
<p>Actually, this isn&#8217;t John&#8217;s first foray into blogging &#8211; he&#8217;s got a personal blog&nbsp; <a href="http://www.xmlhacker.org/blogs/">&lt;Well-Formed/&gt;</a>. There, he describes himself as &#8220;an XML hacker and standards geek for a large software vendor.&#8221; Always nice to have a standards geek around&#8230;Plus, he&#8217;s a big Hitchcock (his new blog is named &#8220;Vertigo&#8221;). Do I feel a Hitch movie marathon coming on?</p>
