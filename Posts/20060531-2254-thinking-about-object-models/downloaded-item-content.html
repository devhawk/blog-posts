<p>I&#8217;m doing some experiments with Amazon&#8217;s S3 Service. Very cool service, I might add. Anyway, the sample C# REST code basically wraps the network requests with a single connection class that has individual methods for each type of service interaction (list all my buckets, list all objects in a bucket, create a bucket, create an object, you get the idea). </p>
<p>However, S3&#8242;s service is a natural hierarchy. The Service contains many Buckets, which in turn contain many Objects. So another way to wrap the service interaction is with a series of objects that are related to one another and only implement the service interactions relevant to that class. (Service would implement List My Buckets and perhaps Create Bucket. Bucket would implement List Objects and Delete Bucket. Again, you get the idea.)</p>
<p>For an interface as relatively simple as S3 (the SOAP interface has a grand total of 13 operations) it probably doesn&#8217;t matter one way or the other. Furthermore, it&#8217;s probably a question of personal preference. My question: What&#8217;s <em>your</em> personal preference? A single object with many methods or a hierarchy of objects each with fewer methods?</p>
