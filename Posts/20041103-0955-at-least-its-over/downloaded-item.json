You&#8217;re right about the conservative election in Australia and the &#8220;fantasy&#8221; comment. <\/p>\n<p>My point about increasing voter turnout was not an attempt to swing to vote to the Democrats &#8211; as I pointed out in my previous post, we had massive turnout this time (highest since &#8217;68 I read somewhere) but the convential wisdom that higher turnout favors Democrats didn&#8217;t hold.
