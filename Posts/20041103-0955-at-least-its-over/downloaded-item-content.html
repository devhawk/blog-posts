<p>While I was driving into work this morning, Kerry conceded. While he hasn&#8217;t made his speech yet as I write this, I&#8217;m assuming he&#8217;ll be magnanimous though in reality he&#8217;s being a realist. Not enough provo votes to overcome the current Bush lead. Maybe it&#8217;s better for Kerry anyway &#8211; as I wrote last night, even if he won Ohio and the election, he&#8217;d be facing an impossible task of uniting the country, fixing Iraq and digging the country out of the economic tarpit that it&#8217;s currently mired in all without the mandate of the popular vote. </p>
<p>Secondly, according to MSNBC, turnout estimation is 59%. That&#8217;s still a failing grade. <a class="commentPermalinkStyle" href="http://www.rodtempleton.net/"><font color="#000080">Rod</font></a><a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView.aspx?guid=8ee683d6-94ff-4d0f-882f-73ba780ad3d5">commented</a> that in Australia, voting is mandatory. I like that idea, but he also pointed out that it would &#8220;never fly&#8221; in the US. Never say never&#8230;</p>
<p>With the result no longer in doubt, I&#8217;m imposing a personal media blackout for the next month or so. The closest I&#8217;m willing to get to politics for a while is is <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/index.html">The West Wing</a>. </p>
