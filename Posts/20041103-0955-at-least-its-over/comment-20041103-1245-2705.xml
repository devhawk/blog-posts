  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ted, you might have seen a server error, but I didn't ban your IP. I don't ban any IP sites on this blog (though I have deleted derogatory comments at times). You're right about the conservative election in Australia and the "fantasy" comment. 

My point about increasing voter turnout was not an attempt to swing to vote to the Democrats - as I pointed out in my previous post, we had massive turnout this time (highest since '68 I read somewhere) but the convential wisdom that higher turnout favors Democrats didn't hold. I doubt that a higher turnout could have overcome Bush's 4 million popular vote lead.

As for the being content with a fantasy, let me make it very clear - I'm not content at all. However, I am burnt out. I need a little R&R before returning to take this head on. But make no mistake, I will be returning.

Sorry you thought I banned your IP. We may disagree, but that doesn't mean I want you to piss off.
