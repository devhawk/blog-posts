<p>My team owns the architect track for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/teched">TechEd 2004</a>. We're hoping to build on the very successful Architecture Symposium from PDC. As part of that effort, I own that community efforts for the architect track. I'm working on the plan now. Obviously, we'll have "the usual" events: Ask the Experts, Birds of a Feather, Speaker Lounge, Attendee Party, etc. Any other suggestions?
