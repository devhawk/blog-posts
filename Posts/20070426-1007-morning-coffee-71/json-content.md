-   It’s been almost four months [since I
    started](http://devhawk.net/2007/01/02/Morning+Coffee+1.aspx) these
    morning coffee posts. I like the regularity – there’s been 84
    weekdays so far this year, so 84 – (71 + 6 days missed from
    vacation) = only seven missed morning coffees. On the other hand, I
    think my daily blogging fix is keeping me from digging deeper into
    some issues. So I’m going to start cutting back to only three
    morning coffee posts per week, with the hope of three deeper
    technical posts and one wildcard post per week.
-   Speaking of cutting back, my parents are in town this weekend so I
    doubt I’ll get a post out tomorrow or Monday. Have a good weekend
    anyway.
-   Windows Server “Longhorn” [Beta
    3](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/longhorn/default.mspx) is
    out. Now is time to start getting serious with it.
-   Joe McKendrick is
    [reporting](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=863) that
    Gartner has given the green light to spending more on SOA. Maybe
    it’s because I work for a technology savvy company, but I’ve never
    understood outsourcing critical business decisions about technology
    adoption to a consulting company.
-   It’s a Joe McKendrick twofer: He [also
    reports](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=864) that IBM
    [is calling
    for](http://www.itweek.co.uk/vnunet/news/2188598/ibm-calls-soa-discovery)
    a new SOA directory / discovery / registry standard to replace UDDI.
    I totally get the need a “new UDDI”, though I’d wager that my
    issues with UDDI are very different than Big Blue’s.
-   Yesterday, I [made a
    crack](http://devhawk.net/2007/04/25/Enterprise+Service+Bus+Give+Me+An+Extra+Special+Bitter+Instead.aspx)
    about how un-scalable the Internet would be if every cFonnection
    went thru a central hub. Two days ago, Clemens has [a long
    post](http://blogs.msdn.com/clemensv/archive/2007/04/25/internet-service-bus.aspx)
    about the implications of an Internet Service Bus. First, I can’t
    wait to see how [that thing](http://servicebus.biztalk.net/) works.
    Second, it’s fairly obvious that not all traffic will go thru this
    bus (since the bus ain’t out yet and yet you’re still reading this
    via the Internets), so maybe that answers [my
    question](http://devhawk.net/2007/04/25/Enterprise+Service+Bus+Give+Me+An+Extra+Special+Bitter+Instead.aspx)
    about ESB’s and centralization? That is to day, use the bus where
    you it’s useful, otherwise don’t bother?
