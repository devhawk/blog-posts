<li>It&#8217;s been almost four months <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/02/Morning+Coffee+1.aspx">since I started</a> these morning coffee posts. I like the regularity &#8211; there&#8217;s been 84 weekdays so far this year, so 84 &#8211; (71 + 6 days missed from vacation) = only seven missed morning coffees. On the other hand, I think my daily blogging fix is keeping me from digging deeper into some issues. So I&#8217;m going to start cutting back to only three morning coffee posts per week, with the hope of three deeper technical posts and one wildcard post per week.</li>
<li>Speaking of cutting back, my parents are in town this weekend so I doubt I&#8217;ll get a post out tomorrow or Monday. Have a good weekend anyway.</li>
<li>Windows Server &#8220;Longhorn&#8221; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/longhorn/default.mspx">Beta 3</a> is out. Now is time to start getting serious with it.</li>
<li>Joe McKendrick is <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=863">reporting</a> that Gartner has given the green light to spending more on SOA. Maybe it&#8217;s because I work for a technology savvy company, but I&#8217;ve never understood outsourcing critical business decisions about technology adoption to a consulting company.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a Joe McKendrick twofer: He <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=864">also reports</a> that IBM <a href="http://www.itweek.co.uk/vnunet/news/2188598/ibm-calls-soa-discovery">is calling for</a> a new SOA directory / discovery / registry standard to replace UDDI. I totally get the need a &#8220;new UDDI&#8221;, though I&#8217;d wager that my issues&nbsp;with UDDI are very different than Big Blue&#8217;s. </li>
<li>Yesterday, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/04/25/Enterprise+Service+Bus+Give+Me+An+Extra+Special+Bitter+Instead.aspx">made a crack</a> about how un-scalable the Internet would be&nbsp;if every cFonnection went thru a central hub. Two days ago, Clemens has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/clemensv/archive/2007/04/25/internet-service-bus.aspx">a long post</a> about the implications of an Internet Service Bus. First, I can&#8217;t wait to see how <a href="http://servicebus.biztalk.net/">that thing</a> works. Second, it&#8217;s fairly obvious that not all traffic will go thru this bus (since the bus ain&#8217;t out yet and yet you&#8217;re still reading this via the Internets), so maybe that answers <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/04/25/Enterprise+Service+Bus+Give+Me+An+Extra+Special+Bitter+Instead.aspx">my question</a> about ESB&#8217;s and centralization? That is to day, use the bus where you it&#8217;s useful, otherwise don&#8217;t bother?</li>
