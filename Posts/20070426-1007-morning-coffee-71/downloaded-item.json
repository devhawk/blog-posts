I like the regularity &#8211; there&#8217;s been 84 weekdays so far this year, so 84 &#8211; (71 + 6 days missed from vacation) = only seven missed morning coffees. On the other hand, I think my daily blogging fix is keeping me from digging deeper into some issues. So I&#8217;m going to start cutting back to only three morning coffee posts per week, with the hope of three deeper technical posts and one wildcard post per week.<\/li>\n<li>Speaking of cutting back, my parents are in town this weekend so I doubt I&#8217;ll get a post out tomorrow or Monday. Have a good weekend anyway.<\/li>\n<li>Windows Server &#8220;Longhorn&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsserver\/longhorn\/default.mspx\">Beta 3<\/a> is out. Now is time to start getting serious with it.<\/li>\n<li>Joe McKendrick is <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.zdnet.com\/service-oriented\/?p=863\">reporting<\/a> that Gartner has given the green light to spending more on SOA. Maybe it&#8217;s because I work for a technology savvy company, but I&#8217;ve never understood outsourcing critical business decisions about technology adoption to a consulting company.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a Joe McKendrick twofer: He <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.zdnet.com\/service-oriented\/?p=864\">also reports<\/a> that IBM <a href=\"http:\/\/www.itweek.co.uk\/vnunet\/news\/2188598\/ibm-calls-soa-discovery\">is calling for<\/a> a new SOA directory \/ discovery \/ registry standard to replace UDDI. I totally get the need a &#8220;new UDDI&#8221;, though I&#8217;d wager that my issues\u00a0with UDDI are very different than Big Blue&#8217;s. <\/li>\n<li>Yesterday, I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/04\/25\/Enterprise+Service+Bus+Give+Me+An+Extra+Special+Bitter+Instead.aspx\">made a crack<\/a> about how un-scalable the Internet would be\u00a0if every cFonnection went thru a central hub. Two days ago, Clemens has <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/clemensv\/archive\/2007\/04\/25\/internet-service-bus.aspx\">a long post<\/a> about the implications of an Internet Service Bus. First, I can&#8217;t wait to see how <a href=\"http:\/\/servicebus.biztalk.net\/\">that thing<\/a> works. Second, it&#8217;s fairly obvious that not all traffic will go thru this bus (since the bus ain&#8217;t out yet and yet you&#8217;re still reading this via the Internets), so maybe that answers <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/04\/25\/Enterprise+Service+Bus+Give+Me+An+Extra+Special+Bitter+Instead.aspx\">my question<\/a> about ESB&#8217;s and centralization? That is to day, use the bus where you it&#8217;s useful, otherwise don&#8217;t bother?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>It&#8217;s been almost four months since I started these morning coffee posts.
