<ul><li>It's been almost four months <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/02/Morning+Coffee+1.aspx">since I started</a> these morning coffee posts. I like the regularity - there's been 84 weekdays so far this year, so 84 - (71 + 6 days missed from vacation) = only seven missed morning coffees. On the other hand, I think my daily blogging fix is keeping me from digging deeper into some issues. So I'm going to start cutting back to only three morning coffee posts per week, with the hope of three deeper technical posts and one wildcard post per week.</li><li>Speaking of cutting back, my parents are in town this weekend so I doubt I'll get a post out tomorrow or Monday. Have a good weekend anyway.</li><li>Windows Server "Longhorn" <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/longhorn/default.mspx">Beta 3</a> is out. Now is time to start getting serious with it.</li><li>Joe McKendrick is <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=863">reporting</a> that Gartner has given the green light to spending more on SOA. Maybe it's because I work for a technology savvy company, but I've never understood outsourcing critical business decisions about technology adoption to a consulting company.</li><li>It's a Joe McKendrick twofer: He <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=864">also reports</a> that IBM <a href="http://www.itweek.co.uk/vnunet/news/2188598/ibm-calls-soa-discovery">is calling for</a> a new SOA directory / discovery / registry standard to replace UDDI. I totally get the need a "new UDDI", though I'd wager that my issues with UDDI are very different than Big Blue's. </li><li>Yesterday, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/04/25/Enterprise+Service+Bus+Give+Me+An+Extra+Special+Bitter+Instead.aspx">made a crack</a> about how un-scalable the Internet would be if every cFonnection went thru a central hub. Two days ago, Clemens has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/clemensv/archive/2007/04/25/internet-service-bus.aspx">a long post</a> about the implications of an Internet Service Bus. First, I can't wait to see how <a href="http://servicebus.biztalk.net/">that thing</a> works. Second, it's fairly obvious that not all traffic will go thru this bus (since the bus ain't out yet and yet you're still reading this via the Internets), so maybe that answers <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/04/25/Enterprise+Service+Bus+Give+Me+An+Extra+Special+Bitter+Instead.aspx">my question</a> about ESB's and centralization? That is to day, use the bus where you it's useful, otherwise don't bother?</li></ul>
