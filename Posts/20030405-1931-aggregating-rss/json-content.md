I really like [Jesse Ezell’s](http://dotnetweblogs.com/Jezell/)[.net
Weblog Archives](http://www.activehead.com/DotNetWeblogs/) (even though
he didn’t spell my name right at first!

Here’s my feature request: Filtering.
[I]()[already](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox)[subscribe](http://radio.weblogs.com/0108971)[to](http://www.inkblog.com)[many](http://www.simplegeek.com)[of](http://objective.mine.nu)[the](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747)[currently](http://www.ingorammer.com/weblog)[archived](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/tewald)[feeds](http://msdn.microsoft.com).
I’d love to be able to filter those out of the RSS feed. Since RSS
retrieval is a simple GET, the list of filtered feeds would need to be
stored on the server side. Or you POST up the list of filtered feeds and
get back the filtered aggregate RSS. Aggregating and archiving RSS seems
to be
[hot](http://www.dotnetweblogs.com)[right](http://www.feedster.com/)
now, so a standard mechanism for filtering would be appreciated. My
vote: lets expose a web service to retrieve aggregate RSS information.
