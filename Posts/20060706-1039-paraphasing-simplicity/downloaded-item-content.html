<p>Albert Einstein is often credited with saying &#8220;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler&#8221;. However, in <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">researching the quote</a> on Wikiquote, I discovered the full quote is actually:</p>
<blockquote><p>The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it&#8217;s funny that the canonical quote on simplicity is actually a simplified version of a significantly more verbose quote.</p>
