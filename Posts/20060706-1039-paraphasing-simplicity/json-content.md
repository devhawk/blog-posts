Albert Einstein is often credited with saying “Everything should be made
as simple as possible, but no simpler”. However, in [researching the
quote](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) on Wikiquote, I
discovered the full quote is actually:

> The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic
> elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender
> the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.

I think it’s funny that the canonical quote on simplicity is actually a
simplified version of a significantly more verbose quote.
