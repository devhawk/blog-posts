All of them have been development related in one way or another. Development consulting, developer evangelism, architecture evangelism, IT architect, etc. For the past six years, I\u2019ve been a program manager for a developer related technology &#8211; first for <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/03\/11\/joining-the-dynamic-languages-team\/\">IronPython<\/a> and later for <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2009\/10\/26\/joining-windows\/\">Windows Runtime<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a good run, but I\u2019m taking the opportunity to move from a \u201cdevelopment related\u201d job to just being a pure\u00a0developer.<\/p>\n<p>I can\u2019t talk much the new gig, other than to say I am working with an all-star cast of braniacs including the likes of <a href=\"http:\/\/joeduffyblog.com\/\">Joe Duffy<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/b\/toub\/\">Stephen Toub<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.adamnathan.net\/\">Adam Nathan<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/b\/kcwalina\/\">Krzysztof Cwalina<\/a>. Just the knowledge osmosis opportunity alone is enough to make my head spin. Luckily, after four years on the Windows Runtime team, I&#8217;m already quite used to working around a bunch of braniacs &#8211; though arguably a less well known in the community bunch once you get beyond than the unestimable <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/b\/larryosterman\/\">Larry Osterman<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As for this blog, I <em>hope<\/em> to be blogging more in the future. No promises, but certainly I can\u2019t blog much less than I have for the past several years (<a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2013\/\">zero posts for all of 2013<\/a> is kind of depressing). In particular, I&#8217;ve been away from production development for many, many, <em>many <\/em>years so I figure there is lots of interesting topics to focus on as I make this transition. In particular, I don&#8217;t have a classic &#8220;algorithms and data structures&#8221; computer science background. Based on the interview questions I got &#8211; all related to linked lists and binary search trees &#8211; I&#8217;m guessing this is an area where I really need to sharpen the saw.<\/p>\n<p>Hope you all have liked the various technology I&#8217;ve worked on so far. Here&#8217;s hoping you like what comes next even more.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I\u2019ve done a lot of different jobs in my 15+ years at Microsoft.
