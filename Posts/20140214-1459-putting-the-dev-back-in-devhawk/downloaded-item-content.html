<p>I&#8217;ve done a lot of different jobs in my 15+ years at Microsoft. All of them have been development related in one way or another. Development consulting, developer evangelism, architecture evangelism, IT architect, etc. For the past six years, I&#8217;ve been a program manager for a developer related technology &#8211; first for <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/03/11/joining-the-dynamic-languages-team/">IronPython</a> and later for <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/10/26/joining-windows/">Windows Runtime</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a good run, but I&#8217;m taking the opportunity to move from a &#8220;development related&#8221; job to just being a pure&nbsp;developer.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t talk much the new gig, other than to say I am working with an all-star cast of braniacs including the likes of <a href="http://joeduffyblog.com/">Joe Duffy</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/toub/">Stephen Toub</a>, <a href="http://blog.adamnathan.net/">Adam Nathan</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kcwalina/">Krzysztof Cwalina</a>. Just the knowledge osmosis opportunity alone is enough to make my head spin. Luckily, after four years on the Windows Runtime team, I&#8217;m already quite used to working around a bunch of braniacs &#8211; though arguably a less well known in the community bunch once you get beyond than the unestimable <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/">Larry Osterman</a>.</p>
<p>As for this blog, I <em>hope</em> to be blogging more in the future. No promises, but certainly I can&#8217;t blog much less than I have for the past several years (<a href="http://devhawk.net/2013/">zero posts for all of 2013</a> is kind of depressing). In particular, I&#8217;ve been away from production development for many, many, <em>many </em>years so I figure there is lots of interesting topics to focus on as I make this transition. In particular, I don&#8217;t have a classic &#8220;algorithms and data structures&#8221; computer science background. Based on the interview questions I got &#8211; all related to linked lists and binary search trees &#8211; I&#8217;m guessing this is an area where I really need to sharpen the saw.</p>
<p>Hope you all have liked the various technology I&#8217;ve worked on so far. Here&#8217;s hoping you like what comes next even more.</p>
