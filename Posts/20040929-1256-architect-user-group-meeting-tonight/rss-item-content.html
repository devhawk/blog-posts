<p>It's late notice, but tonight is the inaugural meeting of the <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_pane/lkjkjhs-7k34j-89kjh23vjhg">Puget Sound chapter</a> of the <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/">International Association of Software Architects</a>. Steven Houglum, MS architect evangelist for the Pacific NW, is presenting on SOA and Software Factories. The meeting is on the MS campus from 6:30-8:30 and you can get <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_peid/789nkj34-kjws789-nmkjhiu?meeting_id=18&amp;mode=View">all the details</a> from the IASA site. As I <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a2ca81d9-8049-44f4-9888-750609312eaa">wrote yesterday</a>, I'm interested to see the general response to software factories, so I'm going to be there.</p><p>IASA is a relatively new organization with seven chapters in the US as well as one in Australia. It started as an architect user group in <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_pane/107">Austin</a> - their <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_peid/P-fb6170c0cd-10006?meeting_id=6&amp;mode=View">first meeting</a> was almost a year ago. The overarching IASA organization started about six months ago, <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/blogs/index.php?p=7">according to</a> the IASA <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/blogs/index.php">weblog</a>. I've spoken to the founder and director Paul Preiss on several occasions and hung out with the Twin Cities chapter president <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/n_alex/">Alex Rupp</a> at TechEd. I think they are doing a great job build a <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/blogs/index.php?p=4">technology agnostic</a> user group community and it's great to see our local field architects supporting it. </p><p>As I said, the first meeting is tonight and that's pretty late notice. If you're interested and can't make it tonight, there are two more meetings scheduled for the Puget Sound group in the next three months. Of course, the <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_pane/105">other chapters</a> are on different schedules, so maybe you can find a meeting in a city near you. If there isn't a chapter near you, I'm sure IASA would be interested if you wanted to <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_pane/106">start one</a>.</p>
