<p>It&#8217;s late notice, but tonight is the inaugural meeting of the <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_pane/lkjkjhs-7k34j-89kjh23vjhg">Puget Sound chapter</a> of the <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/">International Association of Software Architects</a>. Steven Houglum, MS architect evangelist for the Pacific NW, is presenting on SOA and Software Factories. The meeting is on the MS campus from 6:30-8:30 and you can get <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_peid/789nkj34-kjws789-nmkjhiu?meeting_id=18&mode=View">all the details</a> from the IASA site. As I <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a2ca81d9-8049-44f4-9888-750609312eaa">wrote yesterday</a>, I&#8217;m interested to see the general response to software factories, so I&#8217;m going to be there.</p>
<p>IASA is a relatively new organization with seven chapters in the US as well as one in Australia. It started as an architect user group in <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_pane/107">Austin</a> &#8211; their <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_peid/P-fb6170c0cd-10006?meeting_id=6&mode=View">first meeting</a> was almost a year ago. The overarching IASA organization started about six months ago, <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/blogs/index.php?p=7">according to</a> the IASA <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/blogs/index.php">weblog</a>. I&#8217;ve spoken to the founder and director Paul Preiss on several occasions and hung out with the Twin Cities chapter president <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/n_alex/">Alex Rupp</a> at TechEd. I think they are doing a great job build a <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/blogs/index.php?p=4">technology agnostic</a> user group community and it&#8217;s great to see our local field architects supporting it. </p>
<p>As I said, the first meeting is tonight and that&#8217;s pretty late notice. If you&#8217;re interested and can&#8217;t make it tonight, there are two more meetings scheduled for the Puget Sound group in the next three months. Of course, the <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_pane/105">other chapters</a> are on different schedules, so maybe you can find a meeting in a city near you. If there isn&#8217;t a chapter near you, I&#8217;m sure IASA would be interested if you wanted to <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/PFS/portal/media-type/html/user/anon/page/default.psml/js_pane/106">start one</a>.</p>
