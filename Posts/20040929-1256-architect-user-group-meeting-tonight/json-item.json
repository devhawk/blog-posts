The meeting is on the MS campus from 6:30-8:30 and you can get <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iasarchitects.org\/PFS\/portal\/media-type\/html\/user\/anon\/page\/default.psml\/js_peid\/789nkj34-kjws789-nmkjhiu?meeting_id=18&amp;mode=View\">all the details<\/a> from the IASA site. As I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a2ca81d9-8049-44f4-9888-750609312eaa\">wrote yesterday<\/a>, I&#8217;m interested to see the general response to software factories, so I&#8217;m going to be there.<\/p>\n<p>IASA is a relatively new organization with seven chapters in the US as well as one in Australia. It started as an architect user group in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iasarchitects.org\/PFS\/portal\/media-type\/html\/user\/anon\/page\/default.psml\/js_pane\/107\">Austin<\/a> &#8211; their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iasarchitects.org\/PFS\/portal\/media-type\/html\/user\/anon\/page\/default.psml\/js_peid\/P-fb6170c0cd-10006?meeting_id=6&amp;mode=View\">first meeting<\/a> was almost a year ago. The overarching IASA organization started about six months ago, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iasarchitects.org\/blogs\/index.php?p=7\">according to<\/a> the IASA <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iasarchitects.org\/blogs\/index.php\">weblog<\/a>. I&#8217;ve spoken to the founder and director Paul Preiss on several occasions and hung out with the Twin Cities chapter president <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.java.net\/blog\/n_alex\/\">Alex Rupp<\/a> at TechEd. I think they are doing a great job build a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iasarchitects.org\/blogs\/index.php?p=4\">technology agnostic<\/a> user group community and it&#8217;s great to see our local field architects supporting it. <\/p>\n<p>As I said, the first meeting is tonight and that&#8217;s pretty late notice. If you&#8217;re interested and can&#8217;t make it tonight, there are two more meetings scheduled for the Puget Sound group in the next three months. Of course, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iasarchitects.org\/PFS\/portal\/media-type\/html\/user\/anon\/page\/default.psml\/js_pane\/105\">other chapters<\/a> are on different schedules, so maybe you can find a meeting in a city near you. If there isn&#8217;t a chapter near you, I&#8217;m sure IASA would be interested if you wanted to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iasarchitects.org\/PFS\/portal\/media-type\/html\/user\/anon\/page\/default.psml\/js_pane\/106\">start one<\/a>.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>It&#8217;s late notice, but tonight is the inaugural meeting of the Puget Sound chapter of the International Association of Software Architects.
