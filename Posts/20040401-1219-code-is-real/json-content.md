After several weeks of using NewsGator’s [online
services](http://services.newsgator.com/) to read blogs, I’m finally got
app reinstalled (machine switching and paving – you know the drill).
While the web-based reader is nice in a pinch, it’s not as convient as
the Outlook-based reader, so I got way behind on blog reading (which is
partly why I’ve been behind on blog writing). So there may be a few
things that made the rounds in the past few weeks that I’m only getting
to now. [Like
this](http://weblogs.asp.net/mattwar/archive/2004/03/18/91749.aspx).

True.
