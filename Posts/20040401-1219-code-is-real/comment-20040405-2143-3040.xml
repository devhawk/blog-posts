  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nice to see you're still working on improving the product Greg. :) Most of the issue was not having Outlook running, but there were two things I'd like to see in the online version.

#1 - OPML export from online service. I would like to have been able to set up some other reader in the short term until I could get Outlook (and thus NewsGator) back up and running.

#2 - The ability to delete single posts. You can delete all or leave all alone. It would be nice to delete single posts. It would also be nice to provide a check box for each post (along with a check all and uncheck all option) so you can delete a subset without having to do each one manually or deleting all of them.]]></wp:comment_content>
