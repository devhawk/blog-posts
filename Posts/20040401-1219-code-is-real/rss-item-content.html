<p>After several weeks of using NewsGator's <a href="http://services.newsgator.com/">online services</a> to read blogs, I'm finally got app reinstalled (machine switching and paving - you know the drill). While the web-based reader is nice in a pinch, it's not as convient as the Outlook-based reader, so I got way behind on blog reading (which is partly why I've been behind on blog writing). So there may be a few things that made the rounds in the past few weeks that I'm only getting to now. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mattwar/archive/2004/03/18/91749.aspx">Like this</a>. </p><p>True.</p>
