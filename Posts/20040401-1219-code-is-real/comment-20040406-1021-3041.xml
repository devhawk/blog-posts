  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[#1 - you can actually do this today - NGOS will automatically expose your OPML if you so choose...for example, here's mine:

http://services.newsgator.com/ngws/opml.aspx?uid=2&mid=4

To set this up, go to:

http://services.newsgator.com/subscriber/Machines.aspx

in the subscriber site, edit (or create) a "machine" whose subscriptions you want to expose, and enable the public OPML exposure.  If you have some private subscriptions you don't want to expose, just create a new "machine", specify which subscriptions should apply to it, and expose the OPML.  This is what I do, so our internal feeds aren't exposed in my public OPML.

I even use this public OPML file to generate a blogroll on my weblog at 

http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog

This way, I don't have to worry about keeping it up to date - changes in Outlook and in NGOS are reflected automatically.

#2 - I couldn't agree more...this is on the short list of things to address.]]></wp:comment_content>
