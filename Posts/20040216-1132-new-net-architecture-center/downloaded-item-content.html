<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/steve_kirk/archive/2004/02/16/73931.aspx">Steve</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kpleas/archive/2004/02/16/73954.aspx">Keith</a> beat me too it (I was in a meeting), but let me blog the news anyway: We&#8217;ve relaunched the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/">MSDN .NET Architecture Center</a>. In addition to the much-improved look and feel, it improves our ability to get new content on the site. For example, we just posted the February edition of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/newsletter/">Architecture Update</a> featuing an article on smart clients by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dphill/">David Hill</a> and a new community article by yours truly (plus a new yet still horrific picture). We also have two <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/webcasts/default.aspx">webcasts</a> this week (actually, we have webcasts every week).</p>
<p><a href="mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com">Let me know</a> what you think of the new design plus what other content you&#8217;d like to see up there. </p>
<p>BTW, I&#8217;m aware that there is no RSS feed for the new Architecture Center yet. We&#8217;re working on that&#8230;</p>
