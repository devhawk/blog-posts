I didn’t join the midnight madness, but I did pick up [Halo
2](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/halo2) at the company store today. There
was a line around the building before the store opened this morning, but
by lunchtime it was down to a 15 minute wait. Like many others, I was on
the multiplayer beta, but I’m guessing nothing compares to the real
deal. I’m not going to get a chance to play until tonight
![:(](http://devhawk.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif) but I
sure am looking forward to it. Quick reminder – my
[gamertag](http://xbox.com/live) is RayTracer, though I’ll probably
start off w/ the single player campain.

I wonder how many Xbox owners called in sick today?
