<p>I didn&#8217;t join the midnight madness, but I did pick up <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/halo2">Halo 2</a> at the company store today. There was a line around the building before the store opened this morning, but by lunchtime it was down to a 15 minute wait. Like many others, I was on the multiplayer beta, but I&#8217;m guessing nothing compares to the real deal. I&#8217;m not going to get a chance to play until tonight <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_sad.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group473" alt=":(">  but I sure am looking forward to it. Quick reminder &#8211; my <a href="http://xbox.com/live">gamertag</a> is RayTracer, though I&#8217;ll probably start off w/ the single player campain.</p>
<p>I wonder how many Xbox owners called in sick today? </p>
