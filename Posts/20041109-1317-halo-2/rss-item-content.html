<p>I didn't join the midnight madness, but I did pick up <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/halo2">Halo 2</a> at the company store today. There was a line around the building before the store opened this morning, but by lunchtime it was down to a 15 minute wait. Like many others, I was on the multiplayer beta, but I'm guessing nothing compares to the real deal. I'm not going to get a chance to play until tonight :( but I sure am looking forward to it. Quick reminder - my <a href="http://xbox.com/live">gamertag</a> is RayTracer, though I'll probably start off w/ the single player campain.</p><p>I wonder how many Xbox owners called in sick today? </p>
