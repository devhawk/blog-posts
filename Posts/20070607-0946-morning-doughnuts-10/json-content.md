-   I am a big fan of
    [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx),
    and I know Harry likes it as well. Of course I have aliased many of
    the commands so they appear more Unix like. I mention this because
    [David Aiken](http://blogs.msdn.com/daiken/default.aspx) mentions a
    new
    [product](http://blogs.msdn.com/daiken/archive/2007/06/06/n-software-netcmdlets-and-a-powershell-sticker.aspx)
    for PowerShell called
    [NetCmdlets](http://www.nsoftware.com/powershell/) produced by N
    Software. I downloaded a trial and have been impressed so far. If
    you use PowerShell it might be worth giving this a look.
-   The [New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/) has an interesting
    [article](http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2007/05/28/070528ta_talk_surowiecki)
    about feature choices in technology. Basically it comes down to
    customers choose products with more features and customization
    options if given the choice, but when they actually have to use the
    products they prefer simplicity. I think that is something lost on
    those of us who design things. Giving users every possible option
    can make our products seem more difficult to use over simpler less
    feature rich choices. (via [Coding

-   Well it took longer than some may have guessed, but Microsoft has
    been
    [sued](http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/06/06/ms-sued-over-vista-name_1.html)
    over the name Vista by a French TV company. Apparently they were
    going to launch a television station with the same name. I wonder
    what the courts will decide since apparently the TV company didnâ€™t
    register the name in the software category.
