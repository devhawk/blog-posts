<p>As I&#8217;ve done the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/09/04/The+DevHawk+2007+World+Tour.aspx">past</a><a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/05/16/DevHawk+World+Tour+2008.aspx">two</a> years, here&#8217;s a list of all the places I&#8217;m going in the next fiscal year. Traditionally, I&#8217;ve done this post by calendar year, but all MSFT planning is done by FY and so invariably I miss events early in the calendar year but late in the fiscal (like PyCon last year). I&#8217;ll be updating this post periodically as I get tapped for more presentations. There are several other conferences I&#8217;m considering, submitting sessions for, in discussions with, but these are the ones that are confirmed. </p>
<p><strong><u>Danish University Tour, Sept 7-11</u></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/danmark/mdcc/news/ironpython.mspx"><img class="grouped_elements" style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: 0px" title="250px-Dannebrog" border="0" alt="250px-Dannebrog" align="right" src=".\250px-Dannebrog_3.jpg" rel="tc-fancybox-group1285" width="150" height="112"></a> My FY10 travels first take me to Copenhagen, where I was invited by the local subsidiary to present at four different universities in a single week. Don&#8217;t know how much sightseeing I&#8217;ll get done, but I&#8217;ll sure be talking a lot. My host <a href="http://twitter.com/martinesmann">Martin Esmann</a> writes <a href="http://www.computerworld.dk/blog/studblog">Stud.blog</a> for Danish ComputerWorld and <a href="http://www.computerworld.dk/blog/studblog/1931">has a post</a> (in Danish) about my visit. Personally, I am just excited about being featured in something called &#8220;Stud.blog&#8221;! <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group1285" alt=":)">  Actually, Stud here means &#8220;Student&#8221; not &#8220;<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stud">slender, upright members of wood</a>&#8221; or any other definition of the term &#8220;stud&#8221;. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be visiting <a href="http://en.aau.dk/">Aalborg University</a>, <a href="http://www.au.dk/en">Aarhus University</a>, <a href="http://www.sdu.dk/?sc_lang=en">University of Southern Denmark</a> and <a href="http://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copehhagen</a> as well as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/danmark/mdcc/news/ironpython.mspx">delivering a TechTalk</a> at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/danmark/mdcc/">Microsoft Development Center Copenhagen</a>, which is Microsoft&#8217;s biggest development center in Europe. I&#8217;ll primarily be delivering my Iron Languages introductory talk &#8220;Pumping Iron&#8221;, but there&#8217;s also some interest in language development on the DLR so I&#8217;ll be talking on that topic as well.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong><em><a href="http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2009/west2009.aspx">patterns &amp; practices Summit Redmond 2009</a></em></strong>, Oct 12-16</u></strong></p>
<p><a class="grouped_elements" href=".\n79454152413_3738_2.png" rel="tc-fancybox-group1285"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: 0px" title="n79454152413_3738" border="0" alt="n79454152413_3738" align="right" src=".\n79454152413_3738_thumb.png" width="100" height="83"></a> This will be my third p&amp;p Summit in a row and fourth in five years. This year, I&#8217;m doing a talk called &#8220;Not Everything is a new Nail() : How Languages Influence Design&#8221;. I was supposed to deliver this talk last year, but got side track with my day job and ended up talking about IronPython instead. <a href="http://twitter.com/keithpleas">Keith</a> has made it VERY clear he doesn&#8217;t want another last minute substitution again this year.</p>
<blockquote><p>Turing award winner Alan Perlis is credited with saying &#8216;A language that doesn&#8217;t affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.&#8217; Yet, most programmers rarely venture outside of the comfort zone of statically-typed object-oriented languages. Our heavy use of object-oriented languages influences our thinking to the point that we can?t see alternative approaches at all. This isn?t to say the object-oriented languages are bad, but as is typical in most things, there is no one &#8216;best&#8217; way for all situations. In this talk, VS Languages PM Harry Pierson will look at a given software development scenario from both the object-oriented and functional perspectives, in order to see how much on an influence language really has on our engineering efforts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.msteched.com/europe/Public/default.aspx"><strong><u>Tech&#183;Ed Europe 2009</u></strong></a><strong><u>, Nov 9-13</u></strong></p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: 0px" title="TechEd_Europe_2009" border="0" alt="TechEd_Europe_2009" align="right" src=".\TechEd_Europe_2009_3.png" width="180" height="122"> I knew I was going to be updating this post over time, but I didn&#8217;t expect to have to update it so soon! Literally the day after I posted this, I got the speaker invite for Tech&#183;Ed Europe 2009. My session hasn&#8217;t been posted yet, but this is the abstract we submitted:</p>
<blockquote><p><u>Dynamic Languages on the Microsoft .NET Framework        <br></u>The Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) adds a shared dynamic type system, a standard hosting model, and support for generating fast dynamic code to the CLR. IronPython and IronRuby are Microsoft&#8217;s dynamic language implementations on .NET. In this talk, we&#8217;ll show you how to interactively create great .NET applications using dynamic languages. You&#8217;ll walk away knowing why dynamic languages deserve a spot in your toolbox! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of generic, but given that most of the audience probably hasn&#8217;t seen IronPython or IronRuby, having broad latitude in my presentation topic is a good thing. I&#8217;ll probably deliver a variant of my standard &#8220;Pumping Iron&#8221; talk like I&#8217;m doing in Denmark. I delivered it recently at an internal event with <a href="http://twitter.com/jschementi">Jimmy</a>, so there&#8217;s lots more IronRuby content than there used to be.</p>
<p>The only bummer about doing Tech&#183;Ed Europe is that I&#8217;m only doing one measly talk. I&#8217;m asking around &#8211; I&#8217;d love to do a .NET user group or university talk while I&#8217;m in town. Any takers?</p>

<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; display: inline" alt="Find out what's next" align="right" src=".\PDC09Bling_General_WhatsNext_136.jpg">Update: Tech&#183;Ed Europe and PDC are on back-to-back weeks this year so we&#8217;ll be sending a teammate-to-be-determined to PDC in my stead. My family is very pleased I won&#8217;t be gone for two weeks straight.</p>
<p><strike>Last year, I was on the content team for PDC. This year, that PITA responsibility belongs to someone else so I might actually get real work done in the four weeks leading up to PDC. My team will tell you, last year PDC sucked up 100% of my time for a month as we were driving towards our 2.0 release. </strike></p>
<p><strike>Technically, I haven&#8217;t had a talk for PDC accepted yet. But I submitted three and two are looking good (though I assume only one will make it to the actual show) so I thought I&#8217;d just go ahead and include it on this post. If/when my talks get accepted, I&#8217;ll post links and abstracts. Also, if one of my PDC talks is accepted, I&#8217;ll probably submit a talk for </strike><a href="http://www.lacodecamp.com/"><strike>SoCal Code Camp</strike></a><strike> as well.</strike></p>

I finally feel like I might have something interesting to present at PyCon this year. Last year <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/86/">Dino</a> and <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/25/">Jim</a> handled the presentation duties from our team (with Michael Foord and Jonathan Hartley <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2009/tutorials/schedule/1AM3/">delivering a tutorial</a> and Sarah Sutkiewicz <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/83/">speaking on FePy</a>). We already have one announcement that I think is pretty significant lined up and might have a second depending on how hard I can push LCA and management between now and then. Talk proposals are due October 1st, so any suggestions would be appreciated!</p>
