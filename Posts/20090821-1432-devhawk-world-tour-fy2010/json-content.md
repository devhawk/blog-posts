As I’ve done the
[past](http://devhawk.net/2007/09/04/the-devhawk-2007-world-tour/)[two](http://devhawk.net/2008/05/16/devhawk-world-tour-2008/)
years, here’s a list of all the places I’m going in the next fiscal
year. Traditionally, I’ve done this post by calendar year, but all MSFT
planning is done by FY and so invariably I miss events early in the
calendar year but late in the fiscal (like PyCon last year). I’ll be
updating this post periodically as I get tapped for more presentations.
There are several other conferences I’m considering, submitting sessions
for, in discussions with, but these are the ones that are confirmed.

**Danish University Tour, Sept 7-11**

My FY10 travels first take me to Copenhagen, where I was invited by the
local subsidiary to present at four different universities in a single
week. Don’t know how much sightseeing I’ll get done, but I’ll sure be
talking a lot. My host [Martin Esmann](http://twitter.com/martinesmann)
writes [Stud.blog](http://www.computerworld.dk/blog/studblog) for Danish
ComputerWorld and [has a
post](http://www.computerworld.dk/blog/studblog/1931) (in Danish) about
my visit. Personally, I am just excited about being featured in
something called “Stud.blog”!
:smile:
Actually, Stud here means “Student” not “[slender, upright members of
wood](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stud)” or any other
definition of the term “stud”.

I’ll be visiting [Aalborg University](http://en.aau.dk/), [Aarhus
University](http://www.au.dk/en), [University of Southern
Denmark](http://www.sdu.dk/?sc_lang=en) and [University of
Copehhagen](http://www.ku.dk/english/) as well as [delivering a
TechTalk](http://www.microsoft.com/danmark/mdcc/news/ironpython.mspx) at
the [Microsoft Development Center
Copenhagen](http://www.microsoft.com/danmark/mdcc/), which is
Microsoft’s biggest development center in Europe. I’ll primarily be
delivering my Iron Languages introductory talk “Pumping Iron”, but
there’s also some interest in language development on the DLR so I’ll be
talking on that topic as well.

*****[patterns & practices Summit Redmond
2009](http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2009/west2009.aspx)***, Oct 12-16**

[![n79454152413\_3738](http://s3.amazonaws.com/devhawk_images/WindowsLiveWriter/DevHawkWorldTourFY2010_C89F/n79454152413_3738_thumb.png "n79454152413_3738")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/devhawk_images/WindowsLiveWriter/DevHawkWorldTourFY2010_C89F/n79454152413_3738_2.png)
This will be my third p&p Summit in a row and fourth in five years. This
year, I’m doing a talk called “Not Everything is a new Nail() : How
Languages Influence Design”. I was supposed to deliver this talk last
year, but got side track with my day job and ended up talking about
IronPython instead. [Keith](http://twitter.com/keithpleas) has made it
VERY clear he doesn’t want another last minute substitution again this
year.

[**Tech·Ed Europe
2009**](https://www.msteched.com/europe/Public/default.aspx)**, Nov
9-13**

![TechEd\_Europe\_2009](http://s3.amazonaws.com/devhawk_images/WindowsLiveWriter/DevHawkWorldTourFY2010_C89F/TechEd_Europe_2009_3.png "TechEd_Europe_2009")
I knew I was going to be updating this post over time, but I didn’t
expect to have to update it so soon! Literally the day after I posted
this, I got the speaker invite for Tech·Ed Europe 2009. My session
hasn’t been posted yet, but this is the abstract we submitted:

> Dynamic Languages on the Microsoft .NET Framework\
> The Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) adds a shared dynamic type system,
> a standard hosting model, and support for generating fast dynamic code
> to the CLR. IronPython and IronRuby are Microsoft’s dynamic language
> implementations on .NET. In this talk, we’ll show you how to
> interactively create great .NET applications using dynamic languages.
> You’ll walk away knowing why dynamic languages deserve a spot in your
> toolbox!

It’s kind of generic, but given that most of the audience probably
hasn’t seen IronPython or IronRuby, having broad latitude in my
presentation topic is a good thing. I’ll probably deliver a variant of
my standard “Pumping Iron” talk like I’m doing in Denmark. I delivered
it recently at an internal event with
[Jimmy](http://twitter.com/jschementi), so there’s lots more IronRuby
content than there used to be.

The only bummer about doing Tech·Ed Europe is that I’m only doing one
measly talk. I’m asking around – I’d love to do a .NET user group or
university talk while I’m in town. Any takers?

[**~~Microsoft Professional Developers Conference
2009~~**](http://microsoftpdc.com/)**~~, Nov 17-19~~**

![Find out what's
next](http://microsoftpdc.com/content/images/creative/PDC09Bling_General_WhatsNext_136.jpg)Update:
Tech·Ed Europe and PDC are on back-to-back weeks this year so we’ll be
sending a teammate-to-be-determined to PDC in my stead. My family is
very pleased I won’t be gone for two weeks straight.

~~Last year, I was on the content team for PDC. This year, that PITA
responsibility belongs to someone else so I might actually get real work
done in the four weeks leading up to PDC. My team will tell you, last
year PDC sucked up 100% of my time for a month as we were driving
towards our 2.0 release.~~

~~Technically, I haven’t had a talk for PDC accepted yet. But I
submitted three and two are looking good (though I assume only one will
make it to the actual show) so I thought I’d just go ahead and include
it on this post. If/when my talks get accepted, I’ll post links and
abstracts. Also, if one of my PDC talks is accepted, I’ll probably
submit a talk for~~ [~~SoCal Code Camp~~](http://www.lacodecamp.com/)
~~as well.~~

**[PyCon 2010](http://us.pycon.org/2010/about/), Feb 19-21**

[![pycon\_logo](http://s3.amazonaws.com/devhawk_images/WindowsLiveWriter/DevHawkWorldTourFY2010_C89F/pycon_logo_thumb.gif "pycon_logo")](http://s3.amazonaws.com/devhawk_images/WindowsLiveWriter/DevHawkWorldTourFY2010_C89F/pycon_logo_2.gif)
This will also be my third PyCon in a row, though PyCon last year was a
bit of a whirlwind since I had literally just joined the IronPython
team. I finally feel like I might have something interesting to present
at PyCon this year. Last year
[Dino](http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/86/) and
[Jim](http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/25/) handled
the presentation duties from our team (with Michael Foord and Jonathan
Hartley [delivering a
tutorial](http://us.pycon.org/2009/tutorials/schedule/1AM3/) and Sarah
Sutkiewicz [speaking on
FePy](http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/83/)). We
already have one announcement that I think is pretty significant lined
up and might have a second depending on how hard I can push LCA and
management between now and then. Talk proposals are due October 1st, so
any suggestions would be appreciated!
