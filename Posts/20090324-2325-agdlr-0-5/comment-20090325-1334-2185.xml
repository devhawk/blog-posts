1. Chrion is extensible in that you can add dynamic languages and change the default AppManifest.xaml file that gets generated. Check out Chiron.exe.config for more information.

2. No, when you use XapHttpHandler you're loading Chiron as a library - yes, even though Chiron's an EXE. It's kinda wierd, but the only difference between a managed DLL and EXE is the inclusion of an entrypoint in the EXE. 

3. Given that it's only recommended for use in your dev environment, I haven't done any perf testing on it at all. If you needed something faster, you could always take the source code and make your own improvements.

Good luck with your project. I'd love to hear more about it when you get a chance. ]]></wp:comment_content>
