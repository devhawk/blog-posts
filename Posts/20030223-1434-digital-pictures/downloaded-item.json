The problem with the MSN sites (esp. MSN Groups) is that they are laden with advertising. But the upside is that they are really easy to use. They even have a really easy upload control so you can browse your local machine and select multiple pictures at once. Photos are automatically resized during the upload process to minimize page load size (though you can include a &#8220;print-quality&#8221; version that&#8217;s full sized). Thumbnails automatically get generated (though that seems to be broken on MSN Groups right now). It would be really nice to have an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.asp.net\">ASP.NET<\/a> photo library with a comparable feature set.<\/p>\n<p>Second question &#8211; has anyone used <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/plus\/dme\/Photo.asp\">Plus! Photo Story<\/a>, part of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/plus\/DME\/dmehome.asp\">Plus! Digital Media Edition<\/a>? Unlike the original <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/plus\/windowsxp\/\">Plus<\/a>!, Plus!
