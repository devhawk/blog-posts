While this is my “personal” blog, I do typically keep the topic on
computers in general and CLR in particular (with a
[few](http://devhawk.net/2003/01/25/l-a-funk/)[notable](http://devhawk.net/2003/02/01/response-to-space-shuttle-loss/)[exceptions](http://devhawk.net/2003/02/16/thoughts-on-iraq/)).
So instead of posting a bunch of pictures here, I’ll just point to my
[MSN
Photos](http://photos.msn.com/viewing/album.aspx?m7A!X9U3q6bynoZEhFj0U9CnAD!ZxNyWvtpCrq0vrz6p4X*UcOo9sOL3V4XeypKBqdq6MoyzkJ88oaxvoFIJaqkpMS*H3S3CyWLCJAUkVfdfxhAR0kJAjg$$)
and [MSN
Groups](http://groups.msn.com/HarryPiersonPhotos/patrickharoldpierson.msnw)
sites where I’m posting pictures.

This does lead to a technical question, however: Is there a good
pre-existing photo library web application? The problem with the MSN
sites (esp. MSN Groups) is that they are laden with advertising. But the
upside is that they are really easy to use. They even have a really easy
upload control so you can browse your local machine and select multiple
pictures at once. Photos are automatically resized during the upload
process to minimize page load size (though you can include a
“print-quality” version that’s full sized). Thumbnails automatically get
generated (though that seems to be broken on MSN Groups right now). It
would be really nice to have an [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net) photo
library with a comparable feature set.

Second question – has anyone used [Plus! Photo
Story](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/plus/dme/Photo.asp), part of
[Plus! Digital Media
Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/plus/DME/dmehome.asp)? Unlike
the original [Plus](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/plus/windowsxp/)!,
Plus! DME actually looks like its got some
[fairly](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/plus/dme/Music.asp#analog)[interesting](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/plus/dme/HomeMovies.asp)[utilities](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/plus/dme/Music.asp#partymode)
included.
