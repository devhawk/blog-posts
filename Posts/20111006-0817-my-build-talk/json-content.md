I just realized that while I posted the [demo
steps](http://devhawk.net/2011/09/15/using-winrt-from-csharp-build-demo/) from
my //build talk, I never posted the talk itself here on DevHawk.
Consider that oversight rectified with this post.

scale to the width of my blog automatically. If not, head on over to the
[official
page](http://channel9.msdn.com/events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-531T) for the
talk over on Channel 9)
