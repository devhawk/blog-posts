I just realized that while I posted the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2011/09/15/using-winrt-from-csharp-build-demo/">demo steps</a> from my //build talk, I never posted the talk itself here on DevHawk. Consider that oversight rectified with this post.

(Note, the static image below appears cut-off, but the video should scale to the width of my blog automatically. If not, head on over to the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-531T">official page</a> for the talk over on Channel 9)
