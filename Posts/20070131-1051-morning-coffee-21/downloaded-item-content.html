<li>With this post, I will have posted 31 times in January. I doubt I will average a post a day for the rest of the year, but I&#8217;ve averaged less than half a post for a day for the past two years.

<li>LINQ to whatever is the new hotness. The ADO.NET team blogged about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2007/01/26/querying-datasets-introduction-to-linq-to-dataset.aspx">LINQ to DataSet</a>&nbsp;last week. Of course, there&#8217;s also <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479865.aspx#linqprojec_topic6">LINQ to SQL</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479865.aspx#linqprojec_topic7">LINQ to XML</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2006/08/15/701479.aspx">LINQ to Entities</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xmlteam/archive/2006/11/27/typed-xml-programmer-welcome-to-linq.aspx">LINQ to XSD</a>. Am I missing any other LINQ&#8217;s? (Would that be the missing LINQ? har har har)

<li>Joe McKendrick writes on <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=809">&#8220;rogue&#8221; systems in the enterprise</a>. In typical pundit fashion, he doesn&#8217;t bother to take a stand on the subject, going so far in this case of having a reader poll rather than offering up his own opinion (wouldn&#8217;t want to be wrong, would we?). However, I thought it was interesting that the three poll answers were &#8220;No rogue services&#8221;, &#8220;Sometimes rogue services are OK&#8221; and &#8220;Why fight it?&#8221;. Where&#8217;s &#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s directly empower the users&#8221; in that list?

<li>I finally got around to installing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/powershell">PowerShell</a> on both my laptop and workstation. I love the concept, but so far I just haven&#8217;t had the time to dig into it or found a good problem to solve with it.

<li>Windows Live now has it&#8217;s own <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb264574.aspx">SDK</a>. According to the <a href="http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2007/01/27/94.aspx">Windows Live Dev News</a>, the new and updated areas of the unified SDK include <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb251794.aspx">Search</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259752.aspx">Alerts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa983013.aspx">adCenter</a>.&nbsp;(via <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/webservices/Windows_Live_SDK_released">DotNetKicks</a>)

<li>Speaking of DotNetKicks, is it just me or are a lot of the links submitted by their original authors? <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/users/stevenmcohn">Steven Cohn</a> on <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/webservices/Service_Layer_Transparency">Service Layer Transparency</a>, <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/users/keyvan">Keyvan Nayyeri</a> on <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/wwf/How_to_Write_a_Validator_for_Custom_Workflow_Activity">How to Write Validators for Custom WF Activities</a>, <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/users/madskristensen">Mads Kristensen</a> on <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/csharp/Universal_data_type_checker">Universal Data Type Checker</a>&nbsp;just to name three of the top four articles currently on the DNK home page. Seems fishy to blow your own horn like that, but since SNK <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/docs/earnmoney">shares advertising revenue</a> with story submitters, it sorta makes sense.</li>
