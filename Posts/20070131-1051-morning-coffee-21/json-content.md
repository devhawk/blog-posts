-   With this post, I will have posted 31 times in January. I doubt I
    will average a post a day for the rest of the year, but I’ve
    averaged less than half a post for a day for the past two years.
-   LINQ to whatever is the new hotness. The ADO.NET team blogged about
    [LINQ to
    DataSet](http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2007/01/26/querying-datasets-introduction-to-linq-to-dataset.aspx) last
    week. Of course, there’s also [LINQ to
    SQL](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479865.aspx#linqprojec_topic6),
    [LINQ to
    XML](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479865.aspx#linqprojec_topic7),
    [LINQ to
    Entities](http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2006/08/15/701479.aspx) and
    [LINQ to
    XSD](http://blogs.msdn.com/xmlteam/archive/2006/11/27/typed-xml-programmer-welcome-to-linq.aspx).
    Am I missing any other LINQ’s? (Would that be the missing LINQ? har
    har har)
-   Joe McKendrick writes on [“rogue” systems in the
    enterprise](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=809). In
    typical pundit fashion, he doesn’t bother to take a stand on the
    subject, going so far in this case of having a reader poll rather
    than offering up his own opinion (wouldn’t want to be wrong, would
    we?). However, I thought it was interesting that the three poll
    answers were “No rogue services”, “Sometimes rogue services are OK”
    and “Why fight it?”. Where’s “Yes, let’s directly empower the users”
    in that list?
-   I finally got around to installing
    [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/powershell) on both my laptop
    and workstation. I love the concept, but so far I just haven’t had
    the time to dig into it or found a good problem to solve with it.
-   Windows Live now has it’s own
    [SDK](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb264574.aspx).
    According to the [Windows Live Dev
    News](http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2007/01/27/94.aspx),
    the new and updated areas of the unified SDK include
    [Search](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb251794.aspx),
    [Alerts](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259752.aspx) and [adCenter](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa983013.aspx). (via

-   Speaking of DotNetKicks, is it just me or are a lot of the links
    submitted by their original authors? [Steven
    Cohn](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/users/stevenmcohn) on [Service
    Layer
    Transparency](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/webservices/Service_Layer_Transparency),
    [Keyvan Nayyeri](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/users/keyvan) on [How to
    Write Validators for Custom WF
    Activities](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/wwf/How_to_Write_a_Validator_for_Custom_Workflow_Activity),
    [Mads Kristensen](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/users/madskristensen)
    on [Universal Data Type
    Checker](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/csharp/Universal_data_type_checker) just
    to name three of the top four articles currently on the DNK home
    page. Seems fishy to blow your own horn like that, but since SNK
    [shares advertising
    revenue](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/docs/earnmoney) with story
    submitters, it sorta makes sense.
