Two weeks ago was Strategic Architect Forum as well as the second face-to-face meeting of the Microsoft Architecture Advisory Board this year (the first was <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/community\/newsletter\/022004newsletter.aspx#au2\">reported<\/a> in the February Architecture Center Update newsletter). I&#8217;ll have much more to say on the MAAB later, but having SAF and MAAB the same week is tough &#8211; I worked seven days in a row including four 12+ hour days. <\/p>\n<p>This past week, I was in leadership training with a bunch of teammates and p&amp;p folks. Spent quite a bit of time \u201cin the circle\u201c with <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/edjez\/\">Ed<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/c2.com\/cgi\/wiki?WardCunningham\">Ward<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jamesnewkirk\">Jim<\/a> from p&amp;p plus <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/dphill\/\">David<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/chriskeyser\">Chris<\/a> and Javed from my team (note to self &#8211; lean on Javed to get a blog). The sessions were intense and I learned quite a bit. I agree <a href=\"http:\/\/atlasbrandview.blogspot.com\/2004\/10\/very-short-entry-late-at-night-after.html\">with Norman<\/a>\u00a0(who was also in the training but not in my group)\u00a0that we&#8217;re very fortunate to work for a company willing to invest so much in it&#8217;s employees. However, it was two more 12+ hour days and a total of six over nine days. That&#8217;s now I&#8217;ve started re-reading <a href=\"http:\/\/www.softwareforyourhead.com\/\">Software for Your Head<\/a>, which seems to share many of the same learnings from the leadership training course. Maybe we can start using SFYH in practice in my team &#8211; last time I read it I was part of a distributed team working more as a collections of lone wolves. <\/p>\n<p>Next week, of course, is <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/community\/events\/oopsla2004\/\">OOPSLA<\/a> in Vancouver. I&#8217;m driving up Sunday morning and working the booth in the afternoon. I&#8217;ll be there all week and in the MSFT booth off and on during the conference, so stop by and say hi. I hear you can get flu shots in Canada, so I&#8217;m worried traffic going across the border will stink. It&#8217;ll be a long week, but at least I get next Friday off.\u00a0 <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>It&#8217;s been quiet around here as the last three weeks of October are insane for me this year.
