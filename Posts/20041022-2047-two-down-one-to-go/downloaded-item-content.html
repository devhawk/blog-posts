<p>It&#8217;s been quiet around here as the last three weeks of October are insane for me this year. Two weeks ago was Strategic Architect Forum as well as the second face-to-face meeting of the Microsoft Architecture Advisory Board this year (the first was <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/newsletter/022004newsletter.aspx#au2">reported</a> in the February Architecture Center Update newsletter). I&#8217;ll have much more to say on the MAAB later, but having SAF and MAAB the same week is tough &#8211; I worked seven days in a row including four 12+ hour days. </p>
<p>This past week, I was in leadership training with a bunch of teammates and p&amp;p folks. Spent quite a bit of time &#8220;in the circle&#8220; with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/edjez/">Ed</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk">Jim</a> from p&amp;p plus <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dphill/">David</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chriskeyser">Chris</a> and Javed from my team (note to self &#8211; lean on Javed to get a blog). The sessions were intense and I learned quite a bit. I agree <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/2004/10/very-short-entry-late-at-night-after.html">with Norman</a>&nbsp;(who was also in the training but not in my group)&nbsp;that we&#8217;re very fortunate to work for a company willing to invest so much in it&#8217;s employees. However, it was two more 12+ hour days and a total of six over nine days. That&#8217;s now I&#8217;ve started re-reading <a href="http://www.softwareforyourhead.com/">Software for Your Head</a>, which seems to share many of the same learnings from the leadership training course. Maybe we can start using SFYH in practice in my team &#8211; last time I read it I was part of a distributed team working more as a collections of lone wolves. </p>
<p>Next week, of course, is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/events/oopsla2004/">OOPSLA</a> in Vancouver. I&#8217;m driving up Sunday morning and working the booth in the afternoon. I&#8217;ll be there all week and in the MSFT booth off and on during the conference, so stop by and say hi. I hear you can get flu shots in Canada, so I&#8217;m worried traffic going across the border will stink. It&#8217;ll be a long week, but at least I get next Friday off.&nbsp; </p>
