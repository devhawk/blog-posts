<p>BTW, I ended up watching the three episodes of <a href="http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/home.do">Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!</a> on the flight home from Tech&#183;Ed. I made this a seperate post since I wasn&#8217;t sure how much the MSDN folks would appreciate the &#8220;foul&#8221; lanugage on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/">Architecture Center</a>. Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00019PDNY/104-7563528-7076700">spells it</a> &#8220;Bullsh*t&#8221; but I don&#8217;t get the whole changing one letter thing. I mean, if you&#8217;re offended by the word &#8220;Bullshit&#8221;, are your really going to be placated by a fucking asterisk? <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group371" alt=":)"> </p>
