  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[of course you're right in principle:

 the set of people not offended by bullsh*t IS 
 the set of people not offended by bullshit 

AND

 the set of people offended by bullshit IS 
 the set of people offended by bullsh*t 


some people (such as me) are stuck behind corporate internet connections that give you nasty "blocked" messages (example here: http://www.secretgeek.net/zgeek.asp) if they detect certain sets of characters... hence, these simple replacements mid-stream can make a site accessible to people like me, without providing too much distortion of the original intent.

two wrongs making a sort of almost right.
