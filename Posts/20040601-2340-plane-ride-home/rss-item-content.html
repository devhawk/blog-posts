<p>BTW, I ended up watching the three episodes of <a href="http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/home.do">Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!</a> on the flight home from Tech·Ed. I made this a seperate post since I wasn't sure how much the MSDN folks would appreciate the "foul" lanugage on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/">Architecture Center</a>. Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00019PDNY/104-7563528-7076700">spells it</a> "Bullsh*t" but I don't get the whole changing one letter thing. I mean, if you're offended by the word "Bullshit", are your really going to be placated by a fucking asterisk? :)</p>
