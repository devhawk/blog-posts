There are still a couple of posts to go in my [Practical Parsing in F\#
series](http://devhawk.net/2007/12/10/practical-parsing-in-f/). But
with Christmas and my parents on their way, I’m taking the rest of the
year off.

I’ve stuck the code as it currently stands [up on my
SkyDrive](http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/Projects/Practical%20Parsing%20in%20F%7C3).
Conveniently enough, [xUnit.net](http://www.codeplex.com/xunit) released
[their RC1
build](http://www.codeplex.com/xunit/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8080)
yesterday, which includes supports for static test methods. I’ve
included the RC1 build in the zip file on SkyDrive, as well as simple
batch file so you can run the tests yourself.

Taking a break from this project will give me a good opportunity to
figure out where to take it next. As the code stands, it’s not very
useful – it simply builds a PEG AST from a PEG grammar. That’s just the
first phase of a typical compiler. Without those other phases (you know,
like “generate binary code”) this is just an interesting sample.

Since I’m in the “future pondering” phase, now’s the time to make your
opinion known. What do you, dear reader, think I should do with this
code? Bonus points for wanting to get involved.
