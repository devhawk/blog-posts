<p><a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/">Terra Nova</a> is not the usual place I go to get news around programming language improvements. But <a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2006/02/troubles_with_t.html">they linked</a> to a great presentation from <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/popl/06/">POPL 2006</a> by Tim Sweeney of <a href="http://epicgames.com/">Epic Games</a>. Tim&#8217;s talk is called <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/popl/06/Tim-POPL.ppt">The Next Mainstream Programming Language:&nbsp;A Game Developer&#8217;s Perspective</a> and it talks at great length the major issues facing game developers today. As Nate Combs&nbsp;at Terra Nova remarked, most of these issues are not specific to the game industry, but will likely be seen there first.</p>
<p>Most interesting (to me) was the issue of concurrency. Tim uses <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/g/gearsofwar/">Gears of War</a> for all his examples. Of course, Gears of War is an Xbox 360 exclusive. Xbox 360, as many of you probably know, has&nbsp;three hyper-threaded CPUs for a total capactiy of six hardware threads. Herb Sutter talked about this in his DDJ article <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm">The Free Lunch Is Over</a>. Tim points out &#8211; rightly so &#8211; that &#8220;C++ is ill-equipped for concurrency&#8221;. C#, Java and VB aren&#8217;t much better. Tim conculdes that we&#8217;ll need a combination of effects-free non-imperative code (which can safely be executed in parallel) and software transactional memory (to manage parallel modifications to system state).
</p>
<p>Tim also touches on topics of performance, modularity and reliability. And he has an eye on the practical at all times. For example, he points out that even a four times performance overhead of software transactional memory is acceptable, if it allows the code to scale to many threads.
</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s a great read so check it out. Also, MS Research has a <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~mph/sxm.htm">software transactional memory project</a> you can download if you&#8217;re so inclined. </p>
