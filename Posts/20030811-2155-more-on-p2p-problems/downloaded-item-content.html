<p>I discovered a <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/F/1/2F1A22FD-E838-4BC6-AC40-FBDBCC3A17A4/ANP_FAQ.htm">FAQ</a> for the WinXP Advanced Networking Pack Among other FAQ&#8217;s (including &#8220;What is a F.A.Q.?&#8221;) are &#8220;What is a PNRP seed server?&#8221; and &#8220;How do I know if I can contact the Microsoft hosted PNRP seed server?&#8221;. A seed server is a bootstrap for a PNRP &#8220;cloud&#8221;. PNRP is supposed to be serverless, but there has to be some way for the system to be bootstrapped. MSFT runs a seed server at a well known address (well known to the P2P system, since no one told me). To see if you can reach said seed server, you can run &#8220;netsh p2p pnrp diag ping seed&#8221;. If the number is one or greater, all is good. In my case, that command raises Error 0x800706d9: &#8220;There are no more endpoints available from the endpoint mapper&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure what that means, but I&#8217;m guessing that explains why I can&#8217;t <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=ce69b89e-2f35-48e0-912a-d7ba3919dc43">resolve PNRP names</a>.</p>
