A seed server is a bootstrap for a PNRP &#8220;cloud&#8221;. PNRP is supposed to be serverless, but there has to be some way for the system to be bootstrapped. MSFT runs a seed server at a well known address (well known to the P2P system, since no one told me). To see if you can reach said seed server, you can run &#8220;netsh p2p pnrp diag ping seed&#8221;. If the number is one or greater, all is good. In my case, that command raises Error 0x800706d9: &#8220;There are no more endpoints available from the endpoint mapper&#8221;.
