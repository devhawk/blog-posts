To use my last post as an example, building a central repository of system audit information is an architectural decision. A bad one IMHO &#8211; at least the way Dilbert\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pointy-Haired_Boss\">PHB<\/a> described it &#8211; but an architectural decision all the same. It was a decision about what kind of system to build, part of an overall application portfolio, as opposed to a decision about how to build the system.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve held this opinion of architecture for a long time. Four years (and three jobs) ago, I wrote <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2005\/08\/29\/What+Is+Architecture.aspx\">the following<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>IMO, building a system that has a set of functional requirements (track customers, process orders, etc) and non-functional constraints (sub-second response time, support 10,000 concurrent users, use Microsoft Windows platform, etc) is an engineering problem. Coming up with the lists of functional requirements and non-functional constraints is the architecture problem.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Working with dynamic languages has dramatically changed my view of engineering and design of individual systems. But from the pure architecture perspective, I want to be able to treat individual systems as black boxes as much as possible. That means the programming language is an implementation detail that shouldn\u2019t matter to the architect.<\/p>\n<p>Note the significant bet-hedging language in the paragraph above. I\u2019m using phrases like \u201cshouldn\u2019t matter\u201d and \u201cas much as possible\u201d because we all know that there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cpure architecture perspective\u201d. Unlike building architecture, software architecture is in constant flux at every level. At the enterprise level, there are always new regulatory obligations, new competitors and new partners to consider. At the end-to-end process level, there are always new systems or new version of existing systems coming on line. And at the individual system level, there are always new \u2013 or at least new versions &#8211; of tools, frameworks and languages being released. <\/p>\n<p>Once you introduce time into your architecture perspective, individual system engineering will affect the overall architecture, since system engineering affects the rate of change. Language choice will certainly have some engineering impact. However, in my experience language choice is rarely high on the list of concerns relative to things like project scope and team experience. <\/p>\n<p>So my \u201cNo\u201d answer to Michael\u2019s question is predicated on the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>As an architect, I want to consider individual systems as black boxes where implementation details like language choice are completely irrelevant. <\/li>\n<li>As a practical architect, I realize that some system implementation details are relevant \u2013 especially over time &#8211; but in my experience language choice isn\u2019t one of them. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>On the other hand, most IT shops try to standardize on one programming language \u2013 certainly MS IT did \u2013 so maybe language choice would be more architecturally relevant in a mixed language shop. I\u2019d love to hear from folks who have multiple standard languages in their IT shop \u2013 especially if you have both static and dynamic languages on your standards list.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In the comments from yesterday\u2019s post, IronPython MVP and author extraordinaireMichael Foord asked: Has your view on architecture as a discipline separate from coding changed since working with dynamic languages?
