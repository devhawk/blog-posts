<p>If you like C++ and CLI, you&#8217;re going to love <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org">ECMA</a> TG5 of TC39. Task Group 5 of Technical Committee 39 is going to tackle <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/news/ecma-TG5-PR.htm">C++ bindings for CLI</a>. Since it&#8217;s starting from a draft to be submitted by Microsoft, I assume they will be using all the existing keywords like __gc, __value and __property. I wonder if they&#8217;ll strip out the double underscore prefix?</p>
<p>BTW, if you think the C++ / CLI combination is a waste of time, I say don&#8217;t knock it &#8217;till you try it. If you&#8217;re wrapping an existing codebase with a C or C++ API, it&#8217;s much easier to expose a managed interface with MC++ than C#. Don&#8217;t believe me? Go take a complicated C structure like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winsock/winsock/wsaqueryset_2.asp"> WSAQUERYSET</a> and implement it via C#.</p>
