<p>So now that I&#8217;m back, we&#8217;re beginning work in earnest on my project. For those <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/06/15/Moving+On.aspx">not following along at home</a>, my project is to deliver shared service oriented infrastructure for Microsoft&#8217;s internal IT department. We&#8217;ve spent the time since I moved over working on our business justification, and now we&#8217;re moving into specifications and prototyping. That is, I get to starting getting my hands dirty.</p>
<p>As part of the prototyping efforts, we&#8217;re looking to build some sample business services on top of our prototype infrastructure. The idea being to both illustrate what we&#8217;re building as well as have a playground where we can experiment with new ideas. During the prototyping, I&#8217;ll be pretty involved with the development. But once we start writing production code, the dev team will take that over but I will continue to own the service playground. I&#8217;ve been kicking a playground idea like this around for several years, so I&#8217;m pretty excited about it.</p>
<p>The question is, what kind of business scenario should we build? I want the sample business services to be something interesting and real-world-esque. But of course, it can&#8217;t be too complex since I wasn&#8217;t hired to build a playground as my primary job function.</p>
<p>So far, we have two primary ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise Management System: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms124659.aspx">AdventureWorks</a> is the primary sample database that ships with SQL Server. They have <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms124825.aspx">business scenarios</a> around Sales &amp; Marketing, Product Management, Purchasing and Manufacturing. This sounds&nbsp;suspiciously&nbsp;like an ERP/CRM/SFA type enterprise system. On the plus side, MS is an enterprise so things like ERP/CRM/SFA are the types of solutions we need/use/buy/build internally. On the negative side, it&#8217;s complex to do real-world and teams that actually do ERP/CRM/SFA inside Microsoft might dismiss the infrastructure if the playground isn&#8217;t real-world enough.
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market">Prediction Market</a>: If you&#8217;ve ever seen <a href="http://www.hsx.com/">Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX)</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://www.tradesports.com/">Tradesports</a>, those are prediction markets. The basic idea is that you trade on predictions, rather than companies like you would in a stock market. Using HSX as an example, you get 2 million &#8220;Hollywood Dollars&#8221; (i.e. play money) to invest in <a href="http://movies.hsx.com/moviestockindex.htm">upcoming movies</a> and / or <a href="http://movies.hsx.com/starbondindex.htm">movie stars</a>. Those movies and stars pay out based on the money they make at the box office. They also have <a href="http://movies.hsx.com/movies/servlet/SecuritySearch?advancedSearch=yes&securityType=option&name=&tickerSymbol=&priceRange=&tradingStatus=ALL&ipoDate=&submit=submit">derivatives</a> for opening weekend, <a href="http://movies.hsx.com/special/bb2k6/">blockbusters</a> and the Oscars. HSX even sells <a href="http://www.hsxresearch.com/offerings.htm">forecasting and prediction services</a> based on the HSX market. Of course, I can&#8217;t build something quite so extensive, but we could get pretty far with this idea. The upside is that it&#8217;s relatively simple (compared to enterprise management systems) and there&#8217;s little conflict with existing systems inside Microsoft. The downside also is that it&#8217;s relatively simple and not like anything we&#8217;re building inside Microsoft. </li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m leaning towards the prediction market, as it sounds more fun to build and experiment with. What do you think?</p>
