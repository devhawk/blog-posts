For those <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/06\/15\/Moving+On.aspx\">not following along at home<\/a>, my project is to deliver shared service oriented infrastructure for Microsoft&#8217;s internal IT department. We&#8217;ve spent the time since I moved over working on our business justification, and now we&#8217;re moving into specifications and prototyping. That is, I get to starting getting my hands dirty.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the prototyping efforts, we&#8217;re looking to build some sample business services on top of our prototype infrastructure. The idea being to both illustrate what we&#8217;re building as well as have a playground where we can experiment with new ideas. During the prototyping, I&#8217;ll be pretty involved with the development. But once we start writing production code, the dev team will take that over but I will continue to own the service playground. I&#8217;ve been kicking a playground idea like this around for several years, so I&#8217;m pretty excited about it.<\/p>\n<p>The question is, what kind of business scenario should we build? I want the sample business services to be something interesting and real-world-esque. But of course, it can&#8217;t be too complex since I wasn&#8217;t hired to build a playground as my primary job function.<\/p>\n<p>So far, we have two primary ideas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enterprise Management System: <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ms124659.aspx\">AdventureWorks<\/a> is the primary sample database that ships with SQL Server. They have <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ms124825.aspx\">business scenarios<\/a> around Sales &amp; Marketing, Product Management, Purchasing and Manufacturing. This sounds\u00a0suspiciously\u00a0like an ERP\/CRM\/SFA type enterprise system. On the plus side, MS is an enterprise so things like ERP\/CRM\/SFA are the types of solutions we need\/use\/buy\/build internally. On the negative side, it&#8217;s complex to do real-world and teams that actually do ERP\/CRM\/SFA inside Microsoft might dismiss the infrastructure if the playground isn&#8217;t real-world enough.\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prediction_market\">Prediction Market<\/a>: If you&#8217;ve ever seen <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hsx.com\/\">Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX)<\/a>\u00a0or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tradesports.com\/\">Tradesports<\/a>, those are prediction markets. The basic idea is that you trade on predictions, rather than companies like you would in a stock market. Using HSX as an example, you get 2 million &#8220;Hollywood Dollars&#8221; (i.e. play money) to invest in <a href=\"http:\/\/movies.hsx.com\/moviestockindex.htm\">upcoming movies<\/a> and \/ or <a href=\"http:\/\/movies.hsx.com\/starbondindex.htm\">movie stars<\/a>. Those movies and stars pay out based on the money they make at the box office. They also have <a href=\"http:\/\/movies.hsx.com\/movies\/servlet\/SecuritySearch?advancedSearch=yes&amp;securityType=option&amp;name=&amp;tickerSymbol=&amp;priceRange=&amp;tradingStatus=ALL&amp;ipoDate=&amp;submit=submit\">derivatives<\/a> for opening weekend, <a href=\"http:\/\/movies.hsx.com\/special\/bb2k6\/\">blockbusters<\/a> and the Oscars. HSX even sells <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hsxresearch.com\/offerings.htm\">forecasting and prediction services<\/a> based on the HSX market. Of course, I can&#8217;t build something quite so extensive, but we could get pretty far with this idea. The upside is that it&#8217;s relatively simple (compared to enterprise management systems) and there&#8217;s little conflict with existing systems inside Microsoft. The downside also is that it&#8217;s relatively simple and not like anything we&#8217;re building inside Microsoft. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m leaning towards the prediction market, as it sounds more fun to build and experiment with. What do you think?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So now that I&#8217;m back, we&#8217;re beginning work in earnest on my project.
