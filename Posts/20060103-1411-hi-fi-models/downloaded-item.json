Slowly being the operative word here.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/stuart_kent\/\">Stuart<\/a> has a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/stuart_kent\/archive\/2005\/12\/22\/506687.aspx\">great post<\/a> on the process by which we build models. And he&#8217;s not talking theoretically here, he&#8217;s working on a model for the designer definition file in the DSL toolkit. (Which is good news in and of itself as hand-writing the XML dsldd file is a pain in the butt. Though until then there&#8217;s the great <a href=\"http:\/\/www.modelisoft.com\/Dmd2dd.aspx\">Dm2Dd tool<\/a> from Modelisoft). The iterative process he describes certainly looks a lot like development, in the same way that C# development looks like C development. Similar steps taken on different concepts. Additionally, he&#8217;s working bottom up &#8211; the output of the model will eventually be a working program (a designer in this case) which is the point I made in <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2005\/12\/20\/Abstraction+Gap+Leapfrog.aspx\">Abstraction Gap Leapfrog<\/a>. There are existing abstractions that work now (i.e. the code generated from the existing dsldd file) and he&#8217;s trying to building something one level up from there. <\/p>\n<p>I also like Stuart&#8217;s use of &#8220;fidelity&#8221; instead of my use of &#8220;complete&#8221;. Stuart uses it as an indication of how correct a given model is. That&#8217;s what I was implying when I said &#8220;complete&#8221; but &#8220;fidelity&#8221; captures the idea much better. I could imagine both lo-fidelity and hi-fidelity models for a given domain, though I would imagine you would always want to use the highest fidelity model available. The difference would be the amount of custom code you have to write &#8211; the higher the model fidelity, the less code you write by hand. And I would imagine the model&#8217;s fidelity would evolve over time, which introduces interesting questions regarding language evolution as well as the evolution of projects built with those languages.<\/p>\n<p>I hope Stuart keeps blogging about this project.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m slowly but surely working through my holiday backlog of email and weblogs.
