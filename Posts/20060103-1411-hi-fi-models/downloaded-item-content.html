<p>I&#8217;m slowly but surely working through my holiday backlog of email and weblogs. Slowly being the operative word here.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/">Stuart</a> has a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2005/12/22/506687.aspx">great post</a> on the process by which we build models. And he&#8217;s not talking theoretically here, he&#8217;s working on a model for the designer definition file in the DSL toolkit. (Which is good news in and of itself as hand-writing the XML dsldd file is a pain in the butt. Though until then there&#8217;s the great <a href="http://www.modelisoft.com/Dmd2dd.aspx">Dm2Dd tool</a> from Modelisoft). The iterative process he describes certainly looks a lot like development, in the same way that C# development looks like C development. Similar steps taken on different concepts. Additionally, he&#8217;s working bottom up &#8211; the output of the model will eventually be a working program (a designer in this case) which is the point I made in <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/12/20/Abstraction+Gap+Leapfrog.aspx">Abstraction Gap Leapfrog</a>. There are existing abstractions that work now (i.e. the code generated from the existing dsldd file) and he&#8217;s trying to building something one level up from there. </p>
<p>I also like Stuart&#8217;s use of &#8220;fidelity&#8221; instead of my use of &#8220;complete&#8221;. Stuart uses it as an indication of how correct a given model is. That&#8217;s what I was implying when I said &#8220;complete&#8221; but &#8220;fidelity&#8221; captures the idea much better. I could imagine both lo-fidelity and hi-fidelity models for a given domain, though I would imagine you would always want to use the highest fidelity model available. The difference would be the amount of custom code you have to write &#8211; the higher the model fidelity, the less code you write by hand. And I would imagine the model&#8217;s fidelity would evolve over time, which introduces interesting questions regarding language evolution as well as the evolution of projects built with those languages.</p>
<p>I hope Stuart keeps blogging about this project.</p>
