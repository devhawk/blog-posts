<p>My brother sent me this <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3957094422427700341">great compliation video</a> of <a href="http://www.washingtoncaps.com/team/player.asp?player_id=17">Alexander Ovechkin&#8217;s</a> first year in the NHL. In the words of Barry Melrose, the <a href="http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/trophies/calder.html">Calder Trophy</a> has been a one man race for some time now. Congrats to Alex on being only the second rookie to score 50 goals and 100 points his first season. </p>
