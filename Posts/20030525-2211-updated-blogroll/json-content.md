[ScottW](http://aspnetweblog.com/)[pointed
out](http://aspnetweblog.com/posts/7554.aspx) that [Martin
Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/) has started a
[blog](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/) (or as he calls it, a ‘bliki’).
[Rss](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/bliki.rss) Subscribed. Martin also
provides a feed for [updates](http://martinfowler.com/updates.rss) to
his site.

I took the opportunity to update my blogroll. Many new MSFT bloggers, a
few new non-MSFT bloggers. The two lists are about the same length (for
now).
