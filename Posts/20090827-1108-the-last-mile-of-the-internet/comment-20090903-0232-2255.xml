  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[How about using Jabber (or alike) protocol for relaying?
It works in distributed way just like email, while it has real-time capabilities, also each user can have infinitely many resource locators (and each user has full control over their addresses), then just setup different apps to listen to a different resource name which is subscribed to whatever publisher.
In the end, if your mail/NAT/whatever-publicaly-facing server is Jabber-capable, you have the real-time relay infrastructure in place already. 
Moreover this setup works *everytime* you move your netbook away from home network!
Google uses XMMP even for voice/video communication.
So what are we reinventing?]]></wp:comment_content>
