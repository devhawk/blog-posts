<p>On Monday, I primarily talked to customers and partners. Yesterday, I spent most of my time talking to other Microsofties that I hadn&#8217;t seen or spoken to in a while. For example, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/timmall/">Tim Mallalieu</a> was there talking about the Entity Data Model. I worked with Tim a few years back &#8211; I did his first interview when he came to Microsoft. We didn&#8217;t talk much EDM, but it sure was good to see him.</p>
<p>I finally met <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/">Gareth Jones</a> in person. Gareth &#8211; along with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook">Steve</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/">Stuart</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alan_cameron_wills">Alan</a> &#8211; have a <a href="http://www.domainspecificdevelopment.com/">new book out</a> on the DSL toolkit. Neither stealing nor cajoling worked, I&#8217;ll have to go get my own copy or <a href="http://safari.informit.com/9780321398208">read it on Safari</a>. Gareth and I talked a while about language evolution &#8211; how DSLs come to be. One of the subjects we talked about was <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/21/Internal+DSLs+In+PowerShell.aspx">internal DSLs</a>&nbsp;- I&#8217;ll be interested in Gareth&#8217;s non-immediate reaction. Gareth also <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2007/06/05/teched-day-one-visual-studio-2008-shell.aspx">blogged</a> yesterday about a TechEd announcement that I had missed: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vsxteam/archive/2007/06/05/Announcing-the-Visual-Studio-2008-Shell.aspx">VS 2008 Shell</a>.</p>
<p>I also spent a long time talking to various members of the DLR team. There seems to be quite a <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/RubyMicrosoft.html">stir brewing</a> about how the Ruby and Microsoft community can / will come together. I will wisely keep my opinions to myself &#8211; I&#8217;m already in the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/06/05/A+REST+Question.aspx">REST/SOAP fray</a>, no need to join another &#8211; though I will say that it&#8217;s encouraging to <a href="http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2007/06/there-can-be-only-one-tale-about-ruby.html">hear the call</a> for &#8220;a good, complete [Ruby language] specification&#8221; in order to support multiple implementations. </p>
