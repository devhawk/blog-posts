that I haven’t been dogfooding, but [Don’s

about programming without generics hit home. For example, look thru the
source code for [dasBlog](http://dasblog.net) and you’ll see a ton of
hand-written type-safe collection classes that Whidbey will just
eliminate en masse. So I loaded up an older laptop with Longhorn &
Whidbey. I have been more interested in Whidbey than Longhorn so far,
but I figured since I could dedicate hardware (LH runs much better on my
650MHz P3 than in a VPC on my 2GHz P4) I might as well go all the way.
Plus, an old friend who spent his Christmas vacation @ Whistler brought
me an authentic [Longhorn Saloon & Grill](http://www.longhornsaloon.ca/)
hat.
