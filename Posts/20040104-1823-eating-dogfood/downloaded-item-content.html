<p>I know <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8317cdbc-4e33-436c-8f61-47f07bfdee0c">I blogged</a> that I haven&#8217;t been dogfooding, but <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-01-01T11:26:43Z">Don&#8217;s post</a> about programming without generics hit home. For example, look thru the source code for <a href="http://dasblog.net">dasBlog</a>&nbsp;and you&#8217;ll see a ton of hand-written type-safe collection classes that Whidbey will just eliminate en masse. So I loaded up an older laptop with Longhorn &amp; Whidbey. I have been more interested in Whidbey than Longhorn so far, but I figured since I could dedicate hardware (LH runs much better on my 650MHz P3 than in a VPC on my 2GHz P4) I might as well go all the way. Plus, an old friend who spent his Christmas vacation @ Whistler brought me an authentic <a href="http://www.longhornsaloon.ca/">Longhorn Saloon &amp; Grill</a> hat.</p>
