In addition to the usual binary and source zip archives, we&#8217;re shipping an MSI installer that gives you the option to include the library files. I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/07\/17\/IronPython+Post+20+Roadmap.aspx\">mentioned<\/a> a couple of weeks ago that I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time with lawyers, and this is the first step towards making the IronPython project as open as possible. Note the use of the word &#8220;first&#8221; in that previous statement. In other words, I&#8217;ve got more lawyers to talk to.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve added a new standard library component category to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/IronPython\/WorkItem\/AdvancedList.aspx\">IronPython Issue Tracker<\/a>. So if you find any issues or incompatibilities with using the standard library with IronPython, please files bugs on them. We haven&#8217;t figured out what set of libraries we&#8217;re going to ship, but we don&#8217;t want to include ones that we know wont work. For example, Kevin Chu <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.ironpython.com\/pipermail\/users-ironpython.com\/2008-August\/007908.html\">reported on the mailing list<\/a> that importing the sqlite3 module fails. This is because we don&#8217;t have a managed version of the _sqlite3 C-based module. So that&#8217;s one we&#8217;ll probably remove outright. <\/p>\n<p>Also, this is the first release we&#8217;ve distributed as an MSI file, and it looks some folks on the mailing list have had some troubles with it. If you have issues, please file setup bugs as well.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Fans of Python use the phrase &#8220;batteries included&#8221; to describe the standard library, which covers everything from asynchronous processing to zip files.About Python I&#8217;m very happy to announce that as of IronPython Beta 4, we are including the Python standard library in an IronPython release.
