I saw from [Bruce Sterling’s blog](http://blog.wired.com/sterling/) that
he’s going to be at [Idea 2006](http://ideaconference.org/) next month
in Seattle. Bruce is at or near the top of the list of “folks I’d like
to chat with over a few good beers”. I saw him at
[ETech](http://devhawk.net/2006/03/07/etech-day-one/) and have since
read and thoroughly enjoyed both [Shaping
Things](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10603) and
[Tomorrow
Now](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679463224). I wonder
if I can make it to IDEA?
