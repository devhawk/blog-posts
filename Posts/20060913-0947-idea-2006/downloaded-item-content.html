<p>I saw from <a href="http://blog.wired.com/sterling/">Bruce Sterling&#8217;s blog</a> that he&#8217;s going to be at <a href="http://ideaconference.org/">Idea 2006</a> next month in Seattle. Bruce is at or near the top of the list of &#8220;folks I&#8217;d like to chat with over a few good beers&#8221;. I saw him at <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/08/ETech+Day+One.aspx">ETech</a> and have since read and thoroughly enjoyed both <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10603">Shaping Things</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679463224">Tomorrow Now</a>. I wonder if I can make it to IDEA?</p>
