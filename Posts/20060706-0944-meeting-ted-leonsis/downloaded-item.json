Long time DevHawk readers might remember that I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2004\/02\/19\/Doing+The+Unthinkable.aspx\">called Ted<\/a> &#8220;an abomination to the sport of hockey&#8221; in the wake of trading Peter Bondra in the &#8220;Great Caps Fire Sale of 2004&#8243; (Jagr, Lang, Nylander, Gonchar and Bondra). So I was somewhat surprised that wrote that he wanted to meet me since I blog a lot about the Caps. As I was in town, we arranged a meeting on short notice. I gotta say, it&#8217;s much easier to call someone an abomination on your blog than to their face. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group765\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>\u00a0I got to spend an hour chatting about hockey &#8211; both from a game and ownership standpoint. Not that I&#8217;m likely to own a hockey team any time soon, but it was cool to hear about. I agreed with the owners during the lockout before Ted&#8217;s hockey team math lesson, but it was useful to see all the numbers laid out. We also spoke about Web 2.0 and new media to some extent. I guess it&#8217;s not surprising that a vice chairman of AOL is acutely aware of the changing face of the media &#8211; hence his reaching out to bloggers, even ones that have said bad things about him.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, expect to see more hockey coverage on these pages in the future. And significantly less owner name calling, unless we trade <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhl.com\/trophies\/calder.html\">Calder Trophy<\/a> winner <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtoncaps.com\/team\/player.asp?player_id=17\">Alexander Ovechkin<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center\"><object height=\"350\" width=\"425\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/W5WCVSBmK3I\" \/><embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/W5WCVSBmK3I\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"><\/embed><\/object><\/div>\n","excerpt":"<p>By coincidence when I was in DC last spring, I got an email from Ted Leonsis, Vice Chairman of American Online and owner of the Washington Capitals.
