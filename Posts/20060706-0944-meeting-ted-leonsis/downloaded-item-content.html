<p>By coincidence when I was in DC last spring, I got an email from <a href="http://ted.aol.com/">Ted Leonsis</a>, Vice Chairman of American Online and owner of the <a href="http://www.washingtoncaps.com/">Washington Capitals</a>. Long time DevHawk readers might remember that I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/02/19/Doing+The+Unthinkable.aspx">called Ted</a> &#8220;an abomination to the sport of hockey&#8221; in the wake of trading Peter Bondra in the &#8220;Great Caps Fire Sale of 2004&#8243; (Jagr, Lang, Nylander, Gonchar and Bondra). So I was somewhat surprised that wrote that he wanted to meet me since I blog a lot about the Caps. As I was in town, we arranged a meeting on short notice. I gotta say, it&#8217;s much easier to call someone an abomination on your blog than to their face. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group765" alt=":)"> </p>
<p>&nbsp;I got to spend an hour chatting about hockey &#8211; both from a game and ownership standpoint. Not that I&#8217;m likely to own a hockey team any time soon, but it was cool to hear about. I agreed with the owners during the lockout before Ted&#8217;s hockey team math lesson, but it was useful to see all the numbers laid out. We also spoke about Web 2.0 and new media to some extent. I guess it&#8217;s not surprising that a vice chairman of AOL is acutely aware of the changing face of the media &#8211; hence his reaching out to bloggers, even ones that have said bad things about him.</p>
<p>Anyway, expect to see more hockey coverage on these pages in the future. And significantly less owner name calling, unless we trade <a href="http://www.nhl.com/trophies/calder.html">Calder Trophy</a> winner <a href="http://www.washingtoncaps.com/team/player.asp?player_id=17">Alexander Ovechkin</a>:</p>
