The 06-07 NHL season finally starts tonight. This offseason feels longer
than most, probably because I’ve been [more involved with
hockey](http://devhawk.net/2006/07/06/Meeting+Ted+Leonsis.aspx) this
past offseason. But the [opening night
rosters](http://www.washingtoncaps.com/news/news.asp?story_id=4207) are
set and the Sabres and Hurricanes face off in just over five hours. Here
are a few quick thoughts:

-   [NHL.com](http://www.nhl.com/) has gotten a make over. I don’t know
    who their designer is, but somewhat should clue them into “less is
    more”.
-   There’s a new beta service called [NHL
    Connect](http://fans.nhl.com/5A-groups/). Looks like forums and
    blogs and profiles right on NHL.com. Looks cool, but currently it’s
    [invite only](http://fans.nhl.com/5A-oem/html/account.html). I would
    hope it would open up soon. Nice to see Caps fans representing – the
    [Washington Capitals Official
    Group](http://fans.nhl.com/nhl_groups/Washington_Capitals_Official_Group/) is
    tied with the
    [Kings](http://fans.nhl.com/nhl_groups/Los_Angeles_Kings_Official_Group/)
    for most number of members (so far).

    Opinion](http://www.ericmcerlain.com/offwingopinion/archives/006560.php)
    I found [this
    article](http://washtimes.com/sports/20061003-114922-9831r.htm) by
    Dave Fay about the NHL’s point system. His recommendation: “winning
    a game in regulation should be worth three points, winning in
    overtime should be worth two, winning in a shootout should be worth
    one. Losing at any time should be what the reward has always been
    for losing — zero.” I could live with that. I’m also cool with two
    points for a win and none for a loss, regardless if it goes to
    overtime or shootout. I’d even be OK (but not elated) with three for
    a win in regulation, two for a win in overtime or shootout and one
    for a loss in overtime or shootout. But the idea that you had out
    more total points for an overtime game than a non overtime game is
    just stupid.
