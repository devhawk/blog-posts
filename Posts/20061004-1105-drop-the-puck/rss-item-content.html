<p>The 06-07 NHL season finally starts tonight. This offseason feels longer than most, probably because I've been <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/07/06/Meeting+Ted+Leonsis.aspx">more involved with hockey</a> this past offseason. But the <a href="http://www.washingtoncaps.com/news/news.asp?story_id=4207">opening night rosters</a> are set and the Sabres and Hurricanes face off in just over five hours. Here are a few quick thoughts:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.nhl.com/">NHL.com</a> has gotten a make over. I don't know who their designer is, but somewhat should clue them into "less is more". </li><li>There's a new beta service called <a href="http://fans.nhl.com/5A-groups/">NHL Connect</a>. Looks like forums and blogs and profiles right on NHL.com. Looks cool, but currently it's <a href="http://fans.nhl.com/5A-oem/html/account.html">invite only</a>. I would hope it would open up soon. Nice to see Caps fans representing - the <a href="http://fans.nhl.com/nhl_groups/Washington_Capitals_Official_Group/">Washington Capitals Official Group</a> is tied with the <a href="http://fans.nhl.com/nhl_groups/Los_Angeles_Kings_Official_Group/">Kings</a> for most number of members (so far). </li><li>Via <a href="http://www.ericmcerlain.com/offwingopinion/archives/006560.php">Off Wing Opinion</a> I found <a href="http://washtimes.com/sports/20061003-114922-9831r.htm">this article</a> by Dave Fay about the NHL's point system. His recommendation: "winning a game in regulation should be worth three points, winning in overtime should be worth two, winning in a shootout should be worth one. Losing at any time should be what the reward has always been for losing -- zero." I could live with that. I'm also cool with two points for a win and none for a loss, regardless if it goes to overtime or shootout. I'd even be OK (but not elated) with three for a win in regulation, two for a win in overtime or shootout and one for a loss in overtime or shootout. But the idea that you had out more total points for an overtime game than a non overtime game is just stupid. </li></ul>
