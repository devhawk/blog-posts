This offseason feels longer than most, probably because I&#8217;ve been <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/07\/06\/Meeting+Ted+Leonsis.aspx\">more involved with hockey<\/a> this past offseason.

I don&#8217;t know who their designer is, but somewhat should clue them into &#8220;less is more&#8221;. <\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s a new beta service called <a href=\"http:\/\/fans.nhl.com\/5A-groups\/\">NHL Connect<\/a>. Looks like forums and blogs and profiles right on NHL.com. Looks cool, but currently it&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fans.nhl.com\/5A-oem\/html\/account.html\">invite only<\/a>. I would hope it would open up soon. Nice to see Caps fans representing &#8211; the <a href=\"http:\/\/fans.nhl.com\/nhl_groups\/Washington_Capitals_Official_Group\/\">Washington Capitals Official Group<\/a>\u00a0is tied with the <a href=\"http:\/\/fans.nhl.com\/nhl_groups\/Los_Angeles_Kings_Official_Group\/\">Kings<\/a> for most number of members (so far). <\/li>\n<li>Via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericmcerlain.com\/offwingopinion\/archives\/006560.php\">Off Wing Opinion<\/a> I found <a href=\"http:\/\/washtimes.com\/sports\/20061003-114922-9831r.htm\">this article<\/a> by Dave Fay about the NHL&#8217;s point system. His recommendation: &#8220;winning a game in regulation should be worth three points, winning in overtime should be worth two, winning in a shootout should be worth one. Losing at any time should be what the reward has always been for losing &#8212; zero.&#8221; I could live with that. I&#8217;m also cool with\u00a0two points for a win and none for a loss, regardless if it goes to overtime or shootout. I&#8217;d even be OK (but not elated) with three for a win in regulation, two for a win in overtime or shootout and one for a loss in overtime or shootout. But the idea that you had out more total points for an overtime game than a non overtime game is just stupid. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>The 06-07 NHL season finally starts tonight.
