But I did see Scott Hanselman\u2019s post on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/BackToBasicsC4MethodOverloadingAndDynamicTypes.aspx\">method overloading and dynamic types<\/a> and Ted Neward\u2019s follow-on post <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2010\/02\/14\/Dont+Fear+The+DynamicVARIANTReaper.aspx\">static-typing fundamentalism<\/a>. Even though I\u2019ve moved on from the IronPython team, dynamic typing is a topic that\u2019s still <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zazzle.com\/you_had_me_at_dynamic_shirt-235421109922997983\">near and dear to my heart<\/a> so I can\u2019t resist throwing in my 2\u00a2.<\/p>\n<p>First off, I agree 100% with Ted\u2019s post &#8211; though not the over-the-top mocking tone. These static &gt; dynamic flame bait comments are so tired that they\u2019ve literally become clich\u00e9. I agree with Ted\u2019s points, but by answering fire with fire he\u2019s just perpetuating the flame war that he claims to be so tired of. I really am tired of it, so I\u2019m not going to bother to address any of the original anti-dynamic typing faux-arguments (fauxguments?) nor Ted\u2019s artful and devastatingly mocking takedown of them.<\/p>\n<p>But I do have a question for any static-typing fundamentalists in the audience: if static typing is so much better than dynamic typing, then how come dynamically typed languages are so popular? Doesn\u2019t natural selection apply to type systems?<\/p>\n<p>Those aren\u2019t rhetorical questions. Building software takes time and effort. While developers often donate time and effort to projects (see: open source) typically they work for money. That money has to come from somewhere \u2013 usually it comes from someone who needs the software built for some business reason. And the people footing the bill for software construction demand the highest return on investment they can get.<\/p>\n<p>If dynamic typing or VARIANT (which is actually weak not dynamic typing, but I digress) really did create \u201chorrific devastation\u201d, wouldn\u2019t that have caused a negative feedback loop where the business people who actually foot the bills for creating software became wary and untrusting of using VB as the language of choice for their projects in favor of strong and statically typed languages that helped developers \u201cmake good choices\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>Yet the opposite happened. VB was the most popular programming language in the world for the better part of a decade. And while VB\u2019s reign at the top is over, I\u2019d argue that these days the most popular programming languages are PHP and JavaScript, both of which are weakly typed dynamic languages too. <\/p>\n<p>Now clearly, popular != better. However, static-typing fundamentalism isn\u2019t an argument about which way is \u201cbetter\u201d so much as an argument about which way is \u201cworthy\u201d. But how can you argue that you\u2019re approach is the only worthy path when the opposite approach has been so successful? Remember, one developer\u2019s \u201chorrific devastation\u201d might be another businessman&#8217;s \u201csuccessful project because it helped me enter a new market faster than my competitors\u201d.\u00a0 <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I\u2019m not reading much in the way of blogs or twitter these days \u2013 way to heads down in my new job for that right now.
