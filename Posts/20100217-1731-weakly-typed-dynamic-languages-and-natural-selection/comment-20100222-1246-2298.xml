  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I generally leave out JavaScript whenever I talk about "popular dynamic languages" simply because there were NO other alternatives to writing client-side code in the web browser. I loves me some JavaScript, but if you're the only man left on an earth full of women, you're gonna get some lovin'.

PHP belongs on the popular list as does Python. People don't talk about Python a lot, but generally chugging away in academia or scientific research there's usually a bunch of Python scripts holding things together.

re: static typing - I always smirk when I attend a talk or read a blog post about the latest compiler gymnastics you can perform on the CLR to avoid having to pay homage to a dead typing system. 90% of all the current design patterns and best practices vanish when you use a dynamic language IMO.]]></wp:comment_content>
