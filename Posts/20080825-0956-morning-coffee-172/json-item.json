We had to trek to Monroe (about 30 minutes away) because it&#8217;s a special 3D movie, and it was only playing there and in downtown Seattle. The movie&#8217;s story is insipid &#8211; three flies stow away on Apollo 11 &#8211; but all the space shots were actually kinda cool. It sure felt like they wanted to be scientifically and historically accurate about the the actual mission (well, other than the part about the flies). Patrick really liked it (he wants to build a rocket in the back yard) and Riley sat thru the whole thing with a minimum of fussing.  <\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m a big fan of Joe Biden, so I&#8217;m really happy Obama <a href=\"http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/26365828\/\">picked him<\/a> to be his running mate.  <\/li>\n<li>I know it&#8217;s old news but what the frak was John Edwards thinking? I like his policies, but the arrogance it takes to run for president when you know you&#8217;ve got that skeleton in your closet is mind-boggling.  <\/li>\n<li>On the other hand, watching the Sean Hannity and guest&#8217;s hypocrisy on Edwards&#8217; affair, only to watch them <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Da4N-CTTRIM\">scramble like cockroaches<\/a> when Colmes points out McCain had admitted to having an affair was frakking hilarious. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>OK, onto geek stuff: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>My new boss Dave Remy has moved to a <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.remlog.net\/\">new blog<\/a>. If you&#8217;re curious what he was up to for the 10 months he was away from Microsoft, he&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.remlog.net\/?p=4\">happy to share<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>IPy and IRuby developer Curt Hagenlocher (aka Iron Curt) is <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/curth\/\">blogging<\/a>. Cue the Ozzy&#8230;I AM IRON CURT. Or don&#8217;t. Anyway, he dives in the deep end of the pool &#8211; no &#8220;hello world&#8221; lollyblogging for Iron Curt &#8211; digging into the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/curth\/archive\/2008\/07\/29\/stackoverflowexception-and-ironpython.aspx\">stack implications of rethrowing exceptions<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/curth\/archive\/2008\/08\/12\/viewing-emitted-il.aspx\">debugging emitted IL<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Srivatsn writes about <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/srivatsn\/archive\/2008\/08\/06\/static-compilation-of-ironpython-scripts.aspx\">static compilation of IPy scripts<\/a>. Note, we&#8217;re not talking about static typing &#8211; it&#8217;s still the same good-old dynamically typed IronPython, just packaged up as an assembly, rather than as a bunch of .py files. Note, if you&#8217;re interested in compiling IronPython, you should check out the PYC sample we published as part of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/IronPython\/Release\/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=14353\">Beta 4<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of IPy Beta 4, Shri Borde posts about the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/shrib\/archive\/2008\/07\/30\/idispatch-support-on-in-ironpython-beta-4.aspx\">COM dispatch support<\/a> which is enabled by default as of Beta 4. If you&#8217;re driving COM automation clients (like Office) from IPy, this is a huge improvement over the old mechanism.  <\/li>\n<li>Jeff Hardy has released a new version of NWSGI, a managed version of Python&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.python.org\/dev\/peps\/pep-0333\/\">Web <strike>Service<\/strike> Server Gateway Interface<\/a>. My understanding is that this would allow any Python web stack written against WSGI to run in IIS with IronPython (subject to IronPython&#8217;s compatibility with CPython). Jeff&#8217;s been <a href=\"http:\/\/jdhardy.blogspot.com\/\">documenting<\/a> his efforts getting Django running with NWSGI on his blog. Awesome work Jeff! (Thanks for the correction Seo!) <\/li>\n<li>I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/03\/08\/The+SoCalled+Attention+Economy.aspx\">never really bought into<\/a> the &#8220;Attention Economy&#8221;, but Chris Anderson&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.longtail.com\/the_long_tail\/2008\/08\/i-wish-people-w.html\">economic analysis<\/a> of his DIY Drones site traffic was fascinating.  <\/li>\n<li>Lutz announces &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.lutzroeder.com\/2008\/08\/future-of-net-reflector.html\">it is time to move on<\/a>&#8221; from Reflector and there was a collective horrified scream in the .NET community. He&#8217;s handing it over to Red Gate, who <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simple-talk.com\/opinion\/opinion-pieces\/the-future-of-reflector-\/\">promised<\/a> they &#8220;will continue to offer the tool for free to the community&#8221;.  <\/li>\n<li>I missed this when he posted it in June, but I really liked Nikhil Kothari <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nikhilk.net\/ViewModel-Pattern-DLR.aspx\">use of the DLR<\/a> in Silverlight to cut down on the XAML verbosity in his ViewModel action binding.  <\/li>\n<li>Brian McNamara previews the new <a href=\"http:\/\/lorgonblog.spaces.live.com\/Blog\/cns!701679AD17B6D310!307.entry\">Add Reference<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/lorgonblog.spaces.live.com\/Blog\/cns!701679AD17B6D310!347.entry\">file ordering<\/a> support in the upcoming F# CTP. I&#8217;m really looking forward to the project-to-project reference support. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve gotten burned because my main project recompiled but my test project didn&#8217;t. You just get used to hitting Rebuild All instead of Build. As for file ordering, it&#8217;s a bit of a bummer that F# requires it, but the new experience is hella better than editing the project file by hand. I&#8217;m <em>really <\/em>looking forward to the new CTP. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I took the kids to see Fly Me To The Moon recently.
