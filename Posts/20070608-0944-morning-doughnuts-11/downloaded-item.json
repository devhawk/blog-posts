I enjoyed that post because I just celebrated the end of my first year here at Microsoft. At this point I am not sure what I have contributed, but I have learned a great deal and want to apply that knowledge over the next year to help the company to succeed. We really do have great people and great technologies.<\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/sonics\/\">Seattle\/Oklahoma City Sonics<\/a> hired a GM who is only <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/sonics\/news\/presti070607.html\">30<\/a> years old. You know you must be getting old when the people running the sports teams are younger than you. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group983\" alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/>  He comes from the Spurs organization though so at least he has a background from a successful franchise.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/209.34.241.68\/benp\/about.aspx\">Ben Pearce<\/a> listed out his <a href=\"http:\/\/209.34.241.68\/benp\/archive\/2007\/06\/07\/tech-ed-2007-top-5-powershell-questions.aspx\">top 5 questions<\/a> about PowerShell this week at TechEd.

I for one am glad to hear that. The other day as I was trying to find some games my 4 year old with the broken leg could play I realized how many games I have that wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate for him. This is very good news in my opinion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Harry will be back on Monday so I will returning to blogging on my website, while I will let the expert return to his normal posts here (not that he really took a break).
