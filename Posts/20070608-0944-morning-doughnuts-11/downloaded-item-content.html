<p>Harry will be back on Monday so I will returning to blogging on my <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/">website</a>, while I will let the expert return to his normal posts here (not that he really took a break). I agree with Harry&#8217;s <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/06/08/TechEd+2007+Heading+Home.aspx">post</a> in that I really want to get something built so that we can talk about more than theoretical models. Like last time I appreciate the opportunity to sub for the master this last week. I hope that you found some of my entries interesting.</p>

<li><a href="http://codebetter.com/">Sam Gentile</a> wrote the other day why it&#8217;s great to be a Microsoft <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/06/07/what-s-great-about-being-a-microsoft-developer.aspx">developer</a>. I enjoyed that post because I just celebrated the end of my first year here at Microsoft. At this point I am not sure what I have contributed, but I have learned a great deal and want to apply that knowledge over the next year to help the company to succeed. We really do have great people and great technologies.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.nba.com/sonics/">Seattle/Oklahoma City Sonics</a> hired a GM who is only <a href="http://www.nba.com/sonics/news/presti070607.html">30</a> years old. You know you must be getting old when the people running the sports teams are younger than you. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group983" alt=":-)">  He comes from the Spurs organization though so at least he has a background from a successful franchise.</li>
<li><a href="http://209.34.241.68/benp/about.aspx">Ben Pearce</a> listed out his <a href="http://209.34.241.68/benp/archive/2007/06/07/tech-ed-2007-top-5-powershell-questions.aspx">top 5 questions</a> about PowerShell this week at TechEd. He also recommends the book &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windows-PowerShell-Action-Bruce-Payette/dp/1932394907/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-0291088-6669211?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181320712&sr=8-1">PowerShell in Action</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24OUCYOSFCKB8/ref=cm_blog_pdp/105-0291088-6669211">Bruce Payette</a>. I heartedly agree with this endorsement as the book is excellent.</li>
<li>It looks like there are going to be more family friendly <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601204&sid=an_wjSge1RpQ&refer=technology">games</a> for the XBOX360. I for one am glad to hear that. The other day as I was trying to find some games my 4 year old with the broken leg could play I realized how many games I have that wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate for him. This is very good news in my opinion.</li>
