Harry will be back on Monday so I will returning to blogging on my
[website](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/), while I will let the
expert return to his normal posts here (not that he really took a
break). I agree with Harry’s
[post](http://devhawk.net/2007/06/08/TechEd+2007+Heading+Home.aspx) in
that I really want to get something built so that we can talk about more
than theoretical models. Like last time I appreciate the opportunity to
sub for the master this last week. I hope that you found some of my
entries interesting.

-   [Sam Gentile](http://codebetter.com/) wrote the other day why it’s
    great to be a Microsoft
    [developer](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/06/07/what-s-great-about-being-a-microsoft-developer.aspx).
    I enjoyed that post because I just celebrated the end of my first
    year here at Microsoft. At this point I am not sure what I have
    contributed, but I have learned a great deal and want to apply that
    knowledge over the next year to help the company to succeed. We
    really do have great people and great technologies.
-   The [Seattle/Oklahoma City Sonics](http://www.nba.com/sonics/) hired
    a GM who is only
    [30](http://www.nba.com/sonics/news/presti070607.html) years old.
    You know you must be getting old when the people running the sports
    teams are younger than you.

    He comes from the Spurs organization though so at least he has a
    background from a successful franchise.
-   [Ben Pearce](http://209.34.241.68/benp/about.aspx) listed out his
    [top 5
    questions](http://209.34.241.68/benp/archive/2007/06/07/tech-ed-2007-top-5-powershell-questions.aspx)
    about PowerShell this week at TechEd. He also recommends the book
    “[PowerShell in
    Action](http://www.amazon.com/Windows-PowerShell-Action-Bruce-Payette/dp/1932394907/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-0291088-6669211?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181320712&sr=8-1)”

    Payette](http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24OUCYOSFCKB8/ref=cm_blog_pdp/105-0291088-6669211).
    I heartedly agree with this endorsement as the book is excellent.
-   It looks like there are going to be more family friendly
    [games](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601204&sid=an_wjSge1RpQ&refer=technology)
    for the XBOX360. I for one am glad to hear that. The other day as I
    was trying to find some games my 4 year old with the broken leg
    could play I realized how many games I have that wouldn’t be
    appropriate for him. This is very good news in my opinion.
