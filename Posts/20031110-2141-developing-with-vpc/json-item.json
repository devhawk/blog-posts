I used to have two machines, my &#8220;production&#8221; machine for email and other office productivity and the my &#8220;development&#8221; machine that I wouldn&#8217;t mind paving at a moments notice, if needed. Now, I only have one machine so I can&#8217;t afford to be able to pave with extreme prejudice. Since I have a honkin&#8217; laptop (2.4 GHz P4, 1GB RAM, 85GB HD) I decided to go the VPC approach. All I have installed in my host is Office 2003, SharpReader and VPC 2004 (it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/press\/2003\/nov03\/11-10VPC2004RTMPR.asp\"> went gold today<\/a>, so I upgraded). However, I have <i>six<\/i> VPC&#8217;s I&#8217;m managing. I can&#8217;t run them all at the same time of course, but it does give me a lot of flexibility. I run two primary VPC&#8217;s &#8211; one for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsxp\">WinXP<\/a> and one for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsserver2003\/default.mspx\">WS03<\/a>. I&#8217;m actually running the WinXP VPC in the background as I blog &#8211; I&#8217;m installing the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsipdev.com\">VSIP SDK<\/a> (with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsipdev.com\/extrasbeta\/default.aspx\">VSIP Extras Beta<\/a> on deck). Then I have three dogfood VPCs &#8211; Longhorn, Whidbey and Indigo. Finally, I have a WS03 VPC running <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsserver2003\/default.mspx\">WSS<\/a>. I need to upgrade my <a href=\"prj_sharepointsynd.aspx\"> SharePoint Syndication project <\/a>to support WSS RTM, but I just haven&#8217;t had the time.<\/p>\n<p>Internally, we have a group that produces demo images and VPC&#8217;s for the technical field. So if I&#8217;m going to demo BTS 2004, I don&#8217;t have to go thru all the install process &#8211; I can either run a VPC or image my machine. Typically, I just use their base image VPC&#8217;s and install what I need. <\/p>\n<p>Only downside to this approach &#8211; chews battery life like there is no tomorrow. I have two spare batteries and was completely drained of power going coast-to-coast a few weeks ago.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Peter blogged on my laptop dev config.
