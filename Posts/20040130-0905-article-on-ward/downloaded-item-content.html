<p>From <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/jalexander/">John Alexander&#8217;s Blog</a>, I found a link to an <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/158020_msftnotebook26.html">article in the Seattle PI</a> about <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> joining Microsoft. The article focuses primarily on descibing wikis, but it does mention he now works for PAG doing pattern work. I liked this quote:
</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"><p>&#8220;I write the seed of the idea and I come back in a week and see how the idea has grown.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s also&nbsp;interesting to see that it took a month and a half for the news to go from <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=6e7c2137-7b31-4494-bf37-a78f238b5512">blogs</a> to a &#8220;mainstream&#8221; news source.</p>
