<p>From <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/jalexander/">John Alexander's Blog</a>, I found a link to an <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/158020_msftnotebook26.html">article in the Seattle PI</a> about <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> joining Microsoft. The article focuses primarily on descibing wikis, but it does mention he now works for PAG doing pattern work. I liked this quote: 
</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>"I write the seed of the idea and I come back in a week and see how the idea has grown."</p></blockquote><p>It's alsoÂ interesting to see that it took a month and a half for the news to go from <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=6e7c2137-7b31-4494-bf37-a78f238b5512">blogs</a> to a "mainstream" news source.</p>
