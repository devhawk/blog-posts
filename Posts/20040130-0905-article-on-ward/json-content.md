From [John Alexander’s Blog](http://geekswithblogs.net/jalexander/), I
found a link to an [article in the Seattle
PI](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/158020_msftnotebook26.html)
about [Ward Cunningham](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham) joining
Microsoft. The article focuses primarily on descibing wikis, but it does
mention he now works for PAG doing pattern work. I liked this quote:

> “I write the seed of the idea and I come back in a week and see how
> the idea has grown.”

It’s also interesting to see that it took a month and a half for the
news to go from
[blogs](http://devhawk.net/2003/12/11/pattern-master-microsoft/) to a
“mainstream” news source.
