<p>After an extended absence, DevHawk is back on the air (so to speak). My pal Tom had a hardware failure and we&#8217;ve moved DevHawk onto a hosting service. As it turns out, Tom had the hosting service set up over a month ago and I just never got around to making the switch. So, I have no one to blame but myself for being offline so long.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s much to blog about, but I&#8217;ll get to that tomorrow. This is as much a test post as anything else.</p>
<p>One quick note, thanks to the relatively-new <a href="http://domains.live.com/">Windows Live Custom Domains</a>, my <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net">blog email</a> is also working again. </p>
