<p>Yesterday was my 39th birthday. Among other things I got a <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vasovagal-syncope/DS00806">vasovagal syncope</a> (aka I fainted), a trip to the hospital and an MRI. </p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve had better birthdays. But I&#8217;m feeling much better now.</p>
<p>Since Monday, I&#8217;ve been having weird numbness and tingling in my hands, feet and midsection. Ever have your foot fall asleep? You know how it feels when your foot wakes up again? It&#8217;s kinda like that. After three days of that, I decided it was time to go see the doctor. My doctor is right by my daughter&#8217;s school, so I try and schedule my appointments so I can drop her off and save my wife the trip. But the only appointment they had yesterday was thirty minutes before my daughter&#8217;s school starts, so I ended up going alone. That turned out to be a very good thing.</p>
<p>Diabetes is one of the things that can cause this numbness and tingling, so my wife and I figured that I shouldn&#8217;t eat anything in case the doctor wanted to check my blood sugar. Sure enough, they wanted to run a few blood tests. My wife called as they were drawing my blood &#8211; she had dropped off our daughter and wanted to know if I wanted her to stop by.&nbsp; I told her to stop by if she wanted, hung up, and promptly fainted. Luckily, Jules had decided she wanted to stop by so she was there when I came to.</p>
<p>Apparently, vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of fainting and having your blood drawn is a common trigger. I&#8217;ve never had that reaction to having my blood drawn, though I can&#8217;t remember ever having my blood drawn while fasting. But I tell you what, I don&#8217;t ever want to go thru that again. All I really remember was trying to get my brain to focus, and it wouldn&#8217;t. Pretty scary.</p>
<p>Playing it better safe than sorry, I was sent off to the hospital to spend two hours crammed in the MRI machine to get an scan of my brain and spine done. Also not a pleasant experience, but much better than fainting. There was much more ominous talk like &#8220;admitting for observation&#8221; and &#8220;lumbar puncture&#8221;, but apparently the MRI didn&#8217;t show anything requiring all that so I was sent home. </p>
<p>I still have the numbness and tingling, though it&#8217;s somewhat better today than yesterday. The good news is that it&#8217;s not diabetes or my thyroid or anything like that and they don&#8217;t think the fainting was related at all. Since the tingling and numbness is a little better today, I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s something like a pinched nerve. My doctor wants me to go see a specialist, so I&#8217;ve got an appointment with a neurologist in a couple of weeks. We&#8217;ll see how it feels by then &#8211; in the meantime, I&#8217;m taking it easy. I even skipped work again today &#8211; five day weekend FTW! </p>
<p>As for my birthday, we did decide to postpone my &#8220;<a href="http://twitter.com/JuliannePierson/status/1851811876">FANTASTIC surprise</a>&#8221;. Jules had arranged for us to go camping on Orcas island over the weekend. I&#8217;m really excited for the trip &#8211; it&#8217;ll be our first real camping trip outside of the back yard &#8211; but I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll be up for it this weekend. My parents sent me a bunch of Capitals gear as well as some money for new hockey equipment &#8211; I really need a new helmet and elbow pads. My kids both made me awesome cards &#8211; Patrick&#8217;s new thing is to make pop-up cards. He also made me a paper &#8220;cake&#8221; crown.</p>
<p>So even though that whole tingling/vasovagal/hospital/MRI thing was a less than fun way to spend the day, I still ended up having a pretty decent birthday. I&#8217;m especially thankful for my awesome wife, who does an amazing job taking care of me when I&#8217;m sick &#8211; much better than I am able to do for her when she&#8217;s sick I&#8217;m afraid. </p>
