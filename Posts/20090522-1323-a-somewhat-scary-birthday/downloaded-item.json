Among other things I got a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mayoclinic.com\/health\/vasovagal-syncope\/DS00806\">vasovagal syncope<\/a> (aka I fainted), a trip to the hospital and an MRI. <\/p>\n<p>Yeah, I\u2019ve had better birthdays. But I\u2019m feeling much better now.<\/p>\n<p>Since Monday, I\u2019ve been having weird numbness and tingling in my hands, feet and midsection. Ever have your foot fall asleep? You know how it feels when your foot wakes up again? It\u2019s kinda like that. After three days of that, I decided it was time to go see the doctor. My doctor is right by my daughter\u2019s school, so I try and schedule my appointments so I can drop her off and save my wife the trip. But the only appointment they had yesterday was thirty minutes before my daughter\u2019s school starts, so I ended up going alone. That turned out to be a very good thing.<\/p>\n<p>Diabetes is one of the things that can cause this numbness and tingling, so my wife and I figured that I shouldn\u2019t eat anything in case the doctor wanted to check my blood sugar. Sure enough, they wanted to run a few blood tests. My wife called as they were drawing my blood \u2013 she had dropped off our daughter and wanted to know if I wanted her to stop by.\u00a0 I told her to stop by if she wanted, hung up, and promptly fainted. Luckily, Jules had decided she wanted to stop by so she was there when I came to.<\/p>\n<p>Apparently, vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of fainting and having your blood drawn is a common trigger. I\u2019ve never had that reaction to having my blood drawn, though I can\u2019t remember ever having my blood drawn while fasting. But I tell you what, I don\u2019t ever want to go thru that again. All I really remember was trying to get my brain to focus, and it wouldn\u2019t. Pretty scary.<\/p>\n<p>Playing it better safe than sorry, I was sent off to the hospital to spend two hours crammed in the MRI machine to get an scan of my brain and spine done. Also not a pleasant experience, but much better than fainting. There was much more ominous talk like \u201cadmitting for observation\u201d and \u201clumbar puncture\u201d, but apparently the MRI didn\u2019t show anything requiring all that so I was sent home. <\/p>\n<p>I still have the numbness and tingling, though it\u2019s somewhat better today than yesterday. The good news is that it\u2019s not diabetes or my thyroid or anything like that and they don\u2019t think the fainting was related at all. Since the tingling and numbness is a little better today, I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s something like a pinched nerve. My doctor wants me to go see a specialist, so I\u2019ve got an appointment with a neurologist in a couple of weeks. We\u2019ll see how it feels by then &#8211; in the meantime, I\u2019m taking it easy. I even skipped work again today \u2013 five day weekend FTW! <\/p>\n<p>As for my birthday, we did decide to postpone my \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JuliannePierson\/status\/1851811876\">FANTASTIC surprise<\/a>\u201d. Jules had arranged for us to go camping on Orcas island over the weekend. I\u2019m really excited for the trip \u2013 it\u2019ll be our first real camping trip outside of the back yard &#8211; but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be up for it this weekend. My parents sent me a bunch of Capitals gear as well as some money for new hockey equipment \u2013 I really need a new helmet and elbow pads. My kids both made me awesome cards \u2013 Patrick\u2019s new thing is to make pop-up cards. He also made me a paper \u201ccake\u201d crown.<\/p>\n<p>So even though that whole tingling\/vasovagal\/hospital\/MRI thing was a less than fun way to spend the day, I still ended up having a pretty decent birthday. I\u2019m especially thankful for my awesome wife, who does an amazing job taking care of me when I\u2019m sick \u2013 much better than I am able to do for her when she\u2019s sick I\u2019m afraid. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Yesterday was my 39th birthday.
