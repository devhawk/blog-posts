I want to listen to my Nomad in my car. Turns out you can get a cable
that plugs into the CD Changer port on the back of the stock stereo in
my 2001 Chevy Blazer that converts it to an RCA jack for only \$60. Add
a \$5 miniplug to RCA cable and I figured I was golden. That is, until I
tried to install it.

A comedian named Rida Rutner once said she “only like cars because they
take me to clothes”. I’m not a big fan of clothes, but I don’t like cars
much either (I only like care because they take me to Fry’s?).
Apparently, this simple sounding DIY project of “plug in cable” requires
the disassembling of half the car. Well, half the dashboard anyway. I
didn’t realy expect that removing the radio would require “releas[ing]
the park brake release cable from the park brake lever”. Wow.

Of course, in my area of expertise I guess most non-experts would be
equally lost. I’m setting up a website for some friends, so I sent them
a quick email with the status, and the response came back “could you
write this again, but this time in English?”
