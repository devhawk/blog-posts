<p>I want to listen to my Nomad in my car. Turns out you can get a cable that plugs into the CD Changer port on the back of the stock&nbsp;stereo in my 2001 Chevy Blazer that converts it to an RCA jack for only $60. Add a $5 miniplug to RCA cable and I figured I was golden. That is, until I tried to install it.</p>
<p>A comedian named Rida Rutner once said she &#8220;only like cars because they take me to clothes&#8221;. I&#8217;m not a big fan of clothes, but I don&#8217;t like cars much either (I only like care because they take me to Fry&#8217;s?). Apparently, this simple sounding DIY project of &#8220;plug in cable&#8221; requires the disassembling of half the car. Well, half the dashboard anyway. I didn&#8217;t realy expect that removing the radio would require &#8220;releas[ing] the park brake release cable from the park brake lever&#8221;. Wow. </p>
<p>Of course, in my area of expertise I guess most non-experts would be equally lost. I&#8217;m setting up a website for some friends, so I sent them a quick email with the status, and the response came back &#8220;could you write this again, but this time in English?&#8221; <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"> </p>
