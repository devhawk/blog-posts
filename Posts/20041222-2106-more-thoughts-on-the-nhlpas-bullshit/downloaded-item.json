I was thinking a little bit more about the NHLPA&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhlpa.com\/Content\/Feature.asp?contentId=3400\">bullshit claim<\/a>\u00a0that the NHL should have used either their ten year revenue average of 9.4% or five year average of 7.8% instead of the 3% number they used when determining the impact of the NHLPA&#8217;s last proposal. I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=48c696d5-2ff6-4ab3-910f-ea02aa18f491\">debunked that<\/a> a few days ago, but I thought of another interesting angle -\u00a0 if the players association really believed that revenue average, then I think they would be willing to accept a salary cap. Here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n<p>Based on the NHLPA&#8217;s proposal, it&#8217;s pretty clear they want the average team payroll to be around $50 million. Their proposed payroll tax doesn&#8217;t even start until you get to $45 million and is a pretty lame 20% until you get to $50 million (at that rate, a $50 million payroll would be taxed only $1 million) The current average team payroll is around $50 million and would be $40 after the NHLPA&#8217;s proposed 24% salary rollback. (Note &#8211; I realize $40 million appears to be a rollback of 20%, but there are some components of team payroll like benefits and payroll bonuses that are unaffected by the rollback.) Now, under the NHL&#8217;s proposal, the salary cap would be linked to overall revenue &#8211; as revenue goes up, salary cap goes up too. If revenues really went up by 7.8% per year, in three years the team salary cap would go up to $49.7 million. At 9.4% growth, the salary cap in 07-08 would be $51.7 million! So you get the NHL&#8217;s cost certainty while still driving salaries up to a level that the players want.<\/p>\n<p>This disparity is really obvious when you look at the NHLPA&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhlpa.com\/Proposal\/Images\/attach3.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group509\">revenue projection<\/a> using five year historical league averages of revenue and player cost growth. In this model, revenue increases at 7.8% per year and player costs at 7.3%. If that were really true, wouldn&#8217;t the salary cap system actually be <i>better<\/i> for the players? Since their share of the overall revenue would stay the same, that would mean the total paid to players would also grow at 7.8% per year. At those rates, the NHL&#8217;s plan of linking player costs to revenue would mean nearly $20 million more for the players in 07-08 than their own plan.<\/p>\n<p>So either the NHLPA is <i>really <\/i>bad at math, they want the owners to make more or even they don&#8217;t believe their own bullshit. I&#8217;m guessing door #3.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Apparently, with no hockey to watch, I am passing the time running numbers in Excel.
