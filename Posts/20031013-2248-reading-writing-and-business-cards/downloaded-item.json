I&#8217;ve been doing a ton of reading, both on and off line. I saw a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.corante.com\/many\/archives\/2003\/10\/13\/powazek_on_moderation_and_secrets.php\">post<\/a> on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.corante.com\/many\/\">Many 2 Many<\/a> that lead me to <a href=\"http:\/\/designforcommunity.com\/\">Design for Community<\/a>. My copy is on the way. But mostly, I&#8217;m busy getting as much stuff done before PDC as I can. In addition to the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/events\/pdc\/architecture_symposium.aspx\">Architecture Symposium<\/a> @ <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/events\/pdc\">PDC<\/a>, my group is doing two other big events the following week, so things are a little crazy around here.<\/p>\n<p>One of the things that&#8217;s been taking up my time is getting my new machine configured. I&#8217;m doing a good job keeping my host WinXP install clean, while installing all my development tools into VPCs. One of the benefits of working on campus is that I now have access to Indigo and Longhorn. I&#8217;ve got one VPC with Longhorn already and I&#8217;m setting up an Indigo\/Whidbey VPC. I also want to kick the tires on Yukon, but I think I&#8217;m going to build a separate VPC for that.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, I got my new business cards. Our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/technet\/itsolutions\/msit\/infowork\/msmproc.asp\">e-procurement tool<\/a> includes a preview of what your business card will look like. My cards from my previous role first had the .NET logo, then I changed to the VS.NET logo. I decided to just go w\/ the vanilla logo cards this time.<\/p>\n<div style=\"BORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5px; BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; FILTER: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.DropShadow(color=#999999,offX=3,offY=3); PADDING-BOTTOM: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 3.5in; PADDING-TOP: 5px; BORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; HEIGHT: 2in; BACKGROUND-COLOR: white\">\n<div style=\"FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FLOAT: left; FONT-FAMILY: arial\">\n<div>\n<div>Microsoft Corporation<\/div>\n<div>One Microsoft Way<\/div>\n<div>Redmond, WA 98052-6399<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 10px\">\n<div>http:\/\/devhawk.net<\/div>\n<div>Tel (425) 705-6045<\/div>\n<div>Fax (425) 936-7329 <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 0.55in\">\n<div style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: arial\">Harry Pierson<\/div>\n<div>Software Architect, Community<\/div>\n<div>NET Enterprise Architecture Team<\/div>\n<div>hpierson @ microsoft .com<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 1in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 30px; TEXT-ALIGN: right\"><img src=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/MSLogoBIZ.gif\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Since I&#8217;m doing community, I figured I should post my contact info where the community can get it.
