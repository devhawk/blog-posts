They&#8217;re announcing two things: <a href=\"http:\/\/forums.xna.com\/ShowThread.aspx?PostID=46553\">XNA Game Studio 3.0<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/forums.xna.com\/ShowThread.aspx?PostID=46554\">Xbox LIVE Community Games<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Given that there was an XNA Game Studio 1.0 and 2.0, news that there will be a 3.0 version releasing this holiday season isn&#8217;t what veteran bloggers like myself call &#8220;a surprise&#8221;. However, the news that XNA GS 3.0 is going to support development of Zune based games was quite a surprise. Rumors of a Microsoft hand held gaming device crop up every few months, but there&#8217;s never been any substance to them. The Zune isn&#8217;t really a handheld gaming device like the DS or PSP &#8211; the <a href=\"http:\/\/forums.xna.com\/ShowThread.aspx?PostID=46553\">FAQ<\/a> points out that it will take &#8220;creative thinking&#8221; to build a game for a device with a 240&#215;320 display that&#8217;s designed for one hand use. Furthermore, Cesar &#8220;Zune Insider&#8221; Menendez points out that &#8220;Zune is a wireless music and video player first and foremost&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s pretty cool to think about what a Zune based game experience would be like. So far we know it&#8217;ll be 2D only and it have full access to any non-DRM music on the device. Also, it will be social &#8211; Zune XNA games will support wireless multiplayer with up to 8 players, though it doesn&#8217;t support cross-platform networking with Xbox and Windows. I can&#8217;t wait to see what the community does with this capability. I&#8217;ll definitely be getting a Zune now.<\/p>\n<p>As for the Xbox LIVE Community Games, it&#8217;s something the XNA folks have been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gamasutra.com\/php-bin\/news_index.php?story=16618\">hinting at since last year<\/a>. This is the announcement the XNA folks have been building towards since day one when they called XNA the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2006\/08\/14\/microsoft-planning-youtube-for-games\/\">YouTube for videogames<\/a>&#8220;. Very much unlike the retail or arcade Xbox channels, Community Games will be peer-reviewed by XNA Creators Club community members instead of Microsoft (though unsurprisingly, MS &#8220;reserves the right to reactively take down a game without prior notification&#8221;). You&#8217;ll even be able to sell your games, though details on that won&#8217;t be available until later in the year.<\/p>\n<p>Like XNA GS 3.0, Community Games will be available &#8220;during the holiday 2008 season.&#8221; However, for the next month, Microsoft is offering a preview of Community Games, offering seven community developed games for free, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/community\/news\/2007\/0813-dreambuildplaywinners.htm\">last year&#8217;s DreamBuildPlay co-winner<\/a> &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/skasoftware.wordpress.com\/category\/the-dishwasher\/\">The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai<\/a>&#8220;. I can&#8217;t wait to get home and try them out. <\/p>\n<p>IMO, this is a <em>huge<\/em> announcement. But what&#8217;s most impressive to me is how much they&#8217;ve accomplished in a fairly short time. XNA was only announced two and a half years ago. That&#8217;s amazing progress for a pretty small team. I can&#8217;t wait to see what they do next.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Shortly after posting today&#8217;s morning coffee, I notice two &#8220;blogging advisories&#8221; in my inbox from the XNA team.
