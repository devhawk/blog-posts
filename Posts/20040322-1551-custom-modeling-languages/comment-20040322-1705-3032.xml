  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'd very much like to see a tool that combines the ease of use of the Acid music tool and the Vegas Video tool created by Sonic Foundry (now owned by Sony).  In addition, there is a freeware tool out there named "Buzz" that inspired me to write my first IE-based VML modeling tool.

If we can somehow codify business requirements (and business solution technical requirements) into such an interface, I think that building the first 80% of the system would be very quick.

In addition, maybe we could intergrate it with DirectX and play the system as a piece of music. Hrmh, not funny.

Search the web for "Buzz music generator" and "Acid Pro" and "Vegas Video".  The first is a freeware program and the latter two have trials, if you're interested.

To shorten the trip, I can summarize that these tools allow you to create base elements and then "paint" with them.  I think software development like this would be sweet.]]></wp:comment_content>
