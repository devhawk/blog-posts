My main machine was getting pretty fragmented, so I ran [graphical disk
defrag
program](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/using/productdoc/en/snap_defrag.asp)
provided with XP. After it ran, my disk still had 27% file fragmentation
and it was recommending that I needed to defrag again. In my online
search for a better defrag utility, I discovered that there’s [command
line defrag
utility](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/using/productdoc/en/defrag.asp).
I tried it out, and now I’m at 0% fragmentation. I’m not sure why the
command-line utility did so much better than the GUI version, but safe
to say I’ll be using the command line version from now on.

I was going to try out the SysInternals [PageDefrag
utility](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pagedefrag.shtml) to
defrag my system files, but they’re already contiguous. Not sure if they
were that way before or if the windows defrag tool took care of them
too.
