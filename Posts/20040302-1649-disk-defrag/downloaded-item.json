Video Drivers using the render as well as the anylize to show in graph process. This would be my logic the command line calls upon less resources so thus would leave more  possible to defrag.I have also seen that by using a second OS to defrag the first idefrags more than when not in the OS. Also it could be a flaw in the program. I have seen that as well in command line utilities as well. It could represent 0% as being with resources current in use. Not to mention the one in the OS could start at true 0% before proccess running. Or it may ignore things like page file sizes and security description. <\/p>\n","parent":0}],"attachments":[],"comment_count":4,"comment_status":"closed","custom_fields":{"dasblog_entryid":["9b22b1d4-7c4a-4c3b-8aae-56803a8e7e7e"],"dasblog_compressedtitle":["Disk+Defrag"],"dasblog_compressedtitleunique":["2004\/03\/03\/Disk+Defrag"]}},"previous_url":"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2004\/02\/29\/finished-kotor\/","next_url":"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2004\/03\/04\/url-addressability\/"}
