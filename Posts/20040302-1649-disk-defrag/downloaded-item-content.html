<p>My main machine was getting pretty fragmented, so I ran <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/using/productdoc/en/snap_defrag.asp">graphical disk defrag program</a> provided with XP. After it ran, my disk still had 27% file fragmentation and it was recommending that I needed to defrag again. In my online search for a better defrag utility, I discovered that there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/using/productdoc/en/defrag.asp">command line defrag utility</a>. I tried it out, and now I&#8217;m at 0% fragmentation. I&#8217;m not sure why the command-line utility did so much better than the GUI version, but safe to say I&#8217;ll be using the command line version from now on.</p>
<p>I was going to try out the SysInternals <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pagedefrag.shtml">PageDefrag utility</a> to defrag my system files, but they&#8217;re already contiguous. Not sure if they were that way before or if the windows defrag tool took care of them too.</p>
