<p>Apparently, President Bush <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-06-13-bush-segway_x.htm">toppled off a Segway</a> last weekend. I thought that it was &#8220;<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/gizmos/0,1452,48788,00.html">virtually impossible</a>&#8221; to fall off one of those things. </p>
