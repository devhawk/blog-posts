  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I live in Baltimore and I had almost exactly the same thoughts about Bondra... the Caps owner is someone who shows everything that is wrong with owners in hockey currently, ALL ROLLED INTO ONE. If it was just the owners with problems, then maybe hockey could survive, but there are becoming more and more players with that "me first" attitude that every NBA player has and that is where they bump heads leading to this lockout. Hopefully after 6 months of no one making money, both sides will begin to change their way, but doubtful.]]></wp:comment_content>
