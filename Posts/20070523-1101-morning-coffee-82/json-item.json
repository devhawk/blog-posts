However, he then reiterates my point that MSFT is moving in on Adobe&#8217;s traditional stronghold (aka the web) while Adobe is moving in on MSFT&#8217;s traditional stronghold (aka the desktop). The upshot is that both companies are trying to deliver a unified &#8220;client&#8221; platform that spans desktop, devices and browser. That sounds like &#8220;platform competition&#8221; to me.  <\/li>\n<li>Apparently I&#8217;m missing the this years compiler dev lab. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/>  John Lam <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iunknown.com\/2007\/05\/compiler_dev_la.html\">is there<\/a>, with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iunknown.com\/files\/dlr_experiences.pdf\">slides from his talk<\/a> on the DLR.

Personally, on the scale between &#8220;I can&#8217;t see where Ruby is such hot shit&#8221; and &#8220;Ruby is the tits&#8221;, I&#8217;m somewhere near the middle, leaning towards tits. I love the expressiveness of Ruby&#8217;s syntax, but I miss the static typing.
