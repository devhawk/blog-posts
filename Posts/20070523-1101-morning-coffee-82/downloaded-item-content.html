But <a href="http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/?p=816">newly minted</a> Adobe RIA evangelist&nbsp;Ryan Stewart <a href="http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/?p=823">writes</a> that calling Silverlight vs. Apollo the next platform competition is overblown. However, he then reiterates my point that MSFT is moving in on Adobe&#8217;s traditional stronghold (aka the web) while Adobe is moving in on MSFT&#8217;s traditional stronghold (aka the desktop). The upshot is that both companies are trying to deliver a unified &#8220;client&#8221; platform that spans desktop, devices and browser. That sounds like &#8220;platform competition&#8221; to me.  </li>
<li>Apparently I&#8217;m missing the this years compiler dev lab. <img class="wp-smiley" src=".\icon_sad.gif" alt=":(">  John Lam <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/05/compiler_dev_la.html">is there</a>, with <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/files/dlr_experiences.pdf">slides from his talk</a> on the DLR. Miguel de Icaza is <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-17.html">there</a>, with <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-17.html">fairly</a><a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-23.html">extensive</a> notes. Hopefully they will post talks like they did <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/speakers.asp">last year</a>. </li>
<li>Speaking of languages, Scott Hanselman <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/118922284/ProgrammerIntentOrWhatYoureNotGettingAboutRubyAndWhyItsTheTits.aspx">explains</a> why he thinks Ruby is &#8220;the tits&#8221;. Personally, on the scale between &#8220;I can&#8217;t see where Ruby is such hot shit&#8221; and &#8220;Ruby is the tits&#8221;, I&#8217;m somewhere near the middle, leaning towards tits. I love the expressiveness of Ruby&#8217;s syntax, but I miss the static typing. Call me <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/21/Im+37.aspx">over the hill</a>, but I like the compiler catching mistakes at compile time. I realize it&#8217;s not for everyone, but I like what I like. </li>
<li>This talk about Ruby&#8217;s expressiveness reminds me of something Larry O&#8217;Brien <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,a3baaf7a-1af3-460a-8486-6b459dab51ed.aspx">said</a> in the wake of the IronRuby announcement: &#8220;I <em>am</em> surprised by the IronRuby announcement. I really thought we were going to see some form of Ruby#:Ruby::C#:Java. Although I&#8217;m happy, I was actually hoping to see a new language.&#8221; The expressiveness of Ruby that Scott describes (which is to say, not all of Ruby&#8217;s expressiveness)&nbsp;would be completely achievable in a statically typed language. Personally, I&#8217;d like to see that language&#8230; </li>
