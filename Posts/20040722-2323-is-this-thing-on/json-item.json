Not just writing, I&#8217;m behind on reading blogs as well. I hit 1000 unread posts today, and scrapped them all. I can offer up excuses like I was on the road most of July so far, my son hasn&#8217;t been feeling well, the start of the fiscal year is always busy (all true &#8211; I had to get up and soothe Patrick back to sleep after he woke up coughing as I wrote this post) but there&#8217;s no real point in making excuses. I started an outlook\u00a0task list of \u201cShit to Blog\u201d back at TechEd, and so far I&#8217;ve only removed two items from the list. Part of the reason for that is that I&#8217;ve been reading <a href=\"http:\/\/www.softwarefactories.com\/TheBook.html\">Software Factories<\/a> which isn&#8217;t generally available, so I&#8217;m holding off on blogging my thoughts until the book ships. Next week, I&#8217;m off for New Zealand and Australia for TechEd, which is going to be awesome but probably mean still less blogging.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m behind on blogging.
