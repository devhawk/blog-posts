<p>When I <a href="http://devhawk.net/New+DasBlog+Version.aspx">upgraded</a> to DasBlog 1.7.2, I had to create an empty rss.aspx file on disk to fool the Title Mapper (that's the part the handles the new title based URLs) into not looking for a post with the title "rss".Â I knew that a large number of people read my post via the RSS feed, so I didn't want to break what has been the feed address since DevHawk started. However, I didn't think the atom feed would matter as much, so I didn't bother to do the workaround for atom.aspx. Turns out I was wrong. Atom.aspx was requested nearly once a minute between 11pm and 12am yesterday. I got tired of counting, but I'm guessing that number is even higher during the middle of the day since just over half of my traffic comes from the US + Canada. So I created an empty atom.aspx page to fool the Title Mapper even further.</p><p>Now, will I have to do the same for my <a href="http://devhawk.net/cdf.ashx">CDF</a> feed?</p>
