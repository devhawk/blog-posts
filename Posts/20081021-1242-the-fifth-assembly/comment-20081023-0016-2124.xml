  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi,

This is perhaps not the best place to report this, but I couldn't find the associated ticket in the CodePlex issue tracker.  I've just updated to RC1.  My project is a fairly basic WPF project and references System.Core; it previously got the warning about the duplicate definition.  Now when I build I get the following error:

Target MarkupCompilePass1:
    C:WindowsMicrosoft.NETFrameworkv3.5Microsoft.WinFX.targets(294,9): error MC1000: Unknown build error, 'Cannot resolve dependency to assembly 'Microsoft.Scripting.ExtensionAttribute, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' because it has not been preloaded. When using the ReflectionOnly APIs, dependent assemblies must be pre-loaded or loaded on demand through the ReflectionOnlyAssemblyResolve event.' 


Initially I just used RC1 from the zip file, but I also tried installing from the .msi on the chance the it would install the assemblies into the GAC but it didn't do that.  Have I missed something in my project configuration?

Thanks,
Dave]]></wp:comment_content>
