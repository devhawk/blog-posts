I&#8217;ve been playing with it, working on ideas for wrapping it in managed code. I&#8217;ve actually got classes wrapping the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/p2psdk\/p2p\/identity_manager_api.asp\">Identity Manager<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/p2psdk\/p2p\/pnrp_namespace_provider_api.asp\">PNRP Namespace<\/a> APIs as well as a start on the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/p2psdk\/p2p\/graphing_api.asp\">Graphing API<\/a>. Due to the nature of the SDK, I&#8217;ve been writing in Managed C++. While tricky and not as much fun as writing C#, MC++ is pretty cool. Wrapping the P2P SDK with MC++ has been much easier than I expected. Except for one problem &#8211; I can&#8217;t seem to get PNRP to work. Even the GraphChat demo doesn&#8217;t work for me.<\/p>\n<p>PNRP stands for the Peer Name Resolution Protocol. It is supposed to be a serverless DNS system. It allows me to register a peer name for later look up and resolution. I can register and unregister a peer name and endpoint. It even throws and exception if I attempt unregister without registering first, so something must be happening. But I can&#8217;t resolve the peer name to an address. And it&#8217;s not just my code (which is copied near verbatim from the help files), the sample GraphChat app doesn&#8217;t seem to work either. I&#8217;m attempting to register in the default &#8220;global&#8221; cloud as is the GraphChat sample, but no luck. <\/p>\n<p>Just chatted Scoble on this &#8211; since he was <a href=\"http:\/\/radio.weblogs.com\/0001011\/2003\/07\/23.html#a3893\">so excited<\/a> when we released it. As a fellow evangelist, he is willing to put me in touch with the powers-that-P2P. However, I&#8217;d appreciate hearing any other &#8220;war stories&#8221; out there.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Has anybody gotten the P2P SDK to work?
