Three new application blocks are up on MSDN: [Service
Aggregation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/ServiceAgg.asp),
[Asynchronous
Invocation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/PAIBlock.asp)
and
[Caching](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/CachingBlock.asp).
There’s also a great new guide on ASP.NET security: [Improving Web
Application Security: Threats and
Countermeasures](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnnetsec/html/ThreatCounter.asp).
These are both part of the overall [patterns &
practices](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/) guidance that
Microsoft is publishing. However, the P&P site moved recently and
doesn’t seem to have any of these new publications listed yet, though
some are listed on the “[Coming
Soon](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/coming.asp)” page.
