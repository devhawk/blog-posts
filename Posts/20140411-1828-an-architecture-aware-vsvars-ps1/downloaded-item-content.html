<p>Like many in the Microsoft dev community, I&#8217;m a heavy user of <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio</a> and <a href="http://microsoft.com/powershell">Powershell</a>. And so, of course, I&#8217;ve been a heavy&nbsp;user <a href="http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/post/The-last-vsvars32ps1-Ill-ever-need.aspx">Chris Tavares&#8217; vsvars32.ps1 script</a>. However, recently I needed the ability to specify my desired processor architecture when setting up a VS command line session. Unfortunately, Chris&#8217;s script&nbsp;wraps&nbsp;vsvars32.bat&nbsp;which only supports generating 32-bit apps. Luckily, VC++ includes a vcvarsall.bat script that let&#8217;s you specify processor architecture. So I updated my local copy of <a href="http://1drv.ms/1kf8g9I">vsvars.ps1&nbsp;</a>to use vcvarsall.bat under the hood and added an -x64 switch to enable setting up a 64-bit command line environment. Vcvarsall.bat supports a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x4d2c09s.aspx">variety of additional options</a>, but 64-bit support is all I needed so that&#8217;s all I added. I didn&#8217;t change the name of the script because there&#8217;s WAY too much muscle memory associated with typing &#8220;vsvars&#8221; to bother changing that now.</p>
<p>If you want it, you can get my architecture aware version of vsvars.ps1 from my OneDrive here: <a href="http://1drv.ms/1kf8g9I">http://1drv.ms/1kf8g9I</a>.</p>
