It turns out that in addition to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/MyXbox\/embedgamercard.htm\">&#8220;official&#8221; gamer card<\/a>\u00a0from Xbox.com, there&#8217;s also the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mygamercard.net\/\">MyGamerCard.net<\/a> site which provides both image and flash versions of gamer cards. Since I&#8217;m using <a href=\"http:\/\/ideas.live.com\/programpage.aspx?versionid=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1\">Windows Live Writer<\/a>, and I hear it&#8217;s really <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.live.com\/blogs\/devlive\/archive\/2006\/08\/14\/44.aspx\">easy to extend<\/a>, I decided to throw together a plugin for inserting Gamer Cards. It was, as advertised, extremely easy. I spent more time laying out the dialog box than I did writing the code to interface with WL Writer.<\/p>\n<p>The plug in provides basically five Gamer Card options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard Xbox.com Gamer Card\n<\/li>\n<li>MGC.net Gamer Card image with link to Xbox.com Profile\n<\/li>\n<li>MGC.net Gamer Card image with link to\u00a0MGC.net Profile\n<\/li>\n<li>MGC.net Gamer Card image only\n<\/li>\n<li>MGC.net Gamer Card flash movie<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/profile.mygamercard.net\/RayTracer\"><img style=\"MARGIN: 0px 5px 0px 0px\" src=\"http:\/\/card.mygamercard.net\/h2o\/RayTracer.png\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group793\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m interested in feedback and suggestions for future versions. MyGamerCard.net provides ten different Gamer Card styles (that&#8217;s my Gamer Card in the &#8220;H2O&#8221; style to the left) so that&#8217;s an obvious enhancement for another day. I&#8217;d also like to evolve the plugin into a &#8220;Smart Content Source&#8221;, which allows you to edit the content after it&#8217;s been created (like the default &#8220;Insert Map&#8221; option). Finally, I&#8217;m thinking of adding support for <a href=\"http:\/\/gamerscorechart.com\/\">GamerScoreChart.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Download <a href=\"http:\/\/cid-0d9bc809858885a4.office.live.com\/self.aspx\/DevHawk%20Content\/BlogFiles\/GamerCard.WriterPlugin.Setup.zip\">GamerCard.WriterPlugin.Setup.zip (142.41 KB)<\/a>\u00a0and enjoy. <a href=\"mailto:harry@devhawk.net\">Let me know<\/a> what you think.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In my last post, I wanted to include a link to my gamer card, showing the NHL 07 logo on it.
