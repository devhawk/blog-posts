<p><img style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 0px 5px" src=".\GamerCardPluginScreenShot.jpg" align="right" border="0">In my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/09/15/Hawkeye+On+NHL+07.aspx">last post</a>, I wanted to include a link to my gamer card, showing the NHL 07 logo on it. It turns out that in addition to the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/MyXbox/embedgamercard.htm">&#8220;official&#8221; gamer card</a>&nbsp;from Xbox.com, there&#8217;s also the <a href="http://www.mygamercard.net/">MyGamerCard.net</a> site which provides both image and flash versions of gamer cards. Since I&#8217;m using <a href="http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionid=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1">Windows Live Writer</a>, and I hear it&#8217;s really <a href="http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2006/08/14/44.aspx">easy to extend</a>, I decided to throw together a plugin for inserting Gamer Cards. It was, as advertised, extremely easy. I spent more time laying out the dialog box than I did writing the code to interface with WL Writer.</p>
<p>The plug in provides basically five Gamer Card options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Xbox.com Gamer Card
</li>
<li>MGC.net Gamer Card image with link to Xbox.com Profile
</li>
<li>MGC.net Gamer Card image with link to&nbsp;MGC.net Profile
</li>
<li>MGC.net Gamer Card image only
</li>
<li>MGC.net Gamer Card flash movie</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m interested in feedback and suggestions for future versions. MyGamerCard.net provides ten different Gamer Card styles (that&#8217;s my Gamer Card in the &#8220;H2O&#8221; style to the left) so that&#8217;s an obvious enhancement for another day. I&#8217;d also like to evolve the plugin into a &#8220;Smart Content Source&#8221;, which allows you to edit the content after it&#8217;s been created (like the default &#8220;Insert Map&#8221; option). Finally, I&#8217;m thinking of adding support for <a href="http://gamerscorechart.com/">GamerScoreChart.com</a>.</p>
