<li>Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/may07/05-29MSSurfacePR.mspx">announces</a><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">Surface Computing</a>. When can you buy one for your house? Probably not anytime soon. TechMeme has <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/070530/p1">lots more</a>.</li>
<li>The one piece of swag I want more than anything else at TechEd is an <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/Evil_Mastermind_Shirts.html">Evil Mastermind shirt</a>.</li>
<li>Nick Allen <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/05/30/wsdl-2-0-proposed.aspx">notes</a> that WSDL 2.0 has reached &#8220;proposed recommendation&#8221; stage. I guess having a &#8220;recommended&#8221; version of WSDL is an improvement over&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">&#8220;note&#8221; version</a>. But other than having a RESTful <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/PR-wsdl20-primer-20070523/#more-bindings-http">HTTP binding</a> in addition to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/PR-wsdl20-primer-20070523/#more-bindings-soap">SOAP binding</a> &#8211; and being longer &#8211; what&#8217;s new?</li>
<li>Speaking of description languages, Don Box <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2007/05/29/47544.aspx">writes</a> about the <a href="https://wadl.dev.java.net/">Web Application Description Language</a> which looks very REST-y in that it supports specifying both the URI as well as the payload format. Like Don, I agree with Erik Johnson who <a href="http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/05/28/does_rest_need_a_service_description_language.html#c82953">commented</a> that &#8220;people attracted to REST (in whatever form) are rebelling against interface-based programming more than WS-* itself&#8221;. I have a longer post on this coming, but suffice to say I&#8217;m really souring on interface-based programming. </li>
<li>Nick Malik <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/05/30/system-reliability-requires-message-durability-immature-wcf.aspx">writes</a> that WCF is immature because of it&#8217;s &#8220;lack of a routable, intermediable, declared message durability option&#8221;. Yeah, that&#8217;s a huge problem in my book too. It also relates to the last bullet &#8211; since durable messaging is inherently async, it doesn&#8217;t fit well into the interface-based programming model.</li>
