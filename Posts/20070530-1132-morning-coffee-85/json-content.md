    that WSDL 2.0 has reached “proposed recommendation” stage. I guess
    having a “recommended” version of WSDL is an improvement over the
    [“note” version](http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl). But other than having a
    RESTful [HTTP
    binding](http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/PR-wsdl20-primer-20070523/#more-bindings-http)
    in addition to the [SOAP
    binding](http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/PR-wsdl20-primer-20070523/#more-bindings-soap)
    – and being longer – what’s new?
-   Speaking of description languages, Don Box
    [writes](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2007/05/29/47544.aspx)
    about the [Web Application Description
    Language](https://wadl.dev.java.net/) which looks very REST-y in
    that it supports specifying both the URI as well as the payload
    format. Like Don, I agree with Erik Johnson who
    [commented](http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/05/28/does_rest_need_a_service_description_language.html#c82953)
    that “people attracted to REST (in whatever form) are rebelling
    against interface-based programming more than WS-\* itself”. I have
    a longer post on this coming, but suffice to say I’m really souring
    on interface-based programming.

    that WCF is immature because of it’s “lack of a routable,
    intermediable, declared message durability option”. Yeah, that’s a
    huge problem in my book too. It also relates to the last bullet –
    since durable messaging is inherently async, it doesn’t fit well
    into the interface-based programming model.
