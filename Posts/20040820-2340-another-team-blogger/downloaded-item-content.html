<p>Actually, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s &#8220;officially&#8221; part of the team &#8217;til next week, but Josh Lee has already <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/finservguy">started a blog</a> about his new job on the Architecture Strategy team. Josh is &#8220;The FinServ Guy&#8221;, and is a member of the <a href="http://www.ifxforum.org/ifxforum.org/index.cfm">IFX Forum</a> Board of Directors. Nothing really meaty on his blog yet, just a Hello World post, but I hear great things about him.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Architecture Strategy team, I <em>finally</em> took 5 minutes to term serv into the machine that hosts DevHawk to update the theme. I keep mentioning the Architecture Strategy extended team <a href="http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx">OPML file</a>, but I wanted to add a blogroll to the site theme. Now, I have a&nbsp;Team Blogroll on the left hand side of my website featuring all of my blogging teammates as well as all the blogging architect evangelists. Enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
