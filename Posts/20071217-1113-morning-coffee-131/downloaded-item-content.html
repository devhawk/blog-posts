<li>On a recommendation from my mother-in-law, I&#8217;ve been watching <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/262/index.jsp" target="_blank">Torchwood</a>. Sort of Men in Black, the series and set in Cardiff. Since it&#8217;s made in England, it&#8217;ll be one of the few shows still running in the new year due to the WGA strike.  </li>
<li>A while back I pointed out that many DotNetKicks articles <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/31/Morning+Coffee+21.aspx" target="_blank">were submitted by their authors</a>. I submitted a <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/01/Morning+Coffee+22.aspx" target="_blank">few of my own</a>, just for kicks (har har), with <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/02/Morning+Coffee+23.aspx" target="_blank">mixed results</a>. Today, I discovered that the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/11/Practical+F+Parsing+The+Parse+Buffer.aspx" target="_blank">parse buffer post</a> from my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/10/Practical+Parsing+In+F.aspx" target="_blank">Practical Parsing in F#</a> series was <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/other/Practical_F_Parsing_Part_1_the_Parse_Buffer" target="_blank">submitted</a>, picked up some kicks, and made it to the home page. That&#8217;s pretty cool. I guess writing more dev-focused articles is the way to go to get attention on DNK.  </li>
<li>Amazon has rolled out a limited beta of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&node=342335011&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA" target="_blank">SimpleDB</a>, which appears to be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/S3-AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&node=16427261&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA" target="_blank">S3</a> + query support. Cost is based on usage: 14&#162;/hour for machine utilization, 10&#162;/GB upload, 13-18&#162;/GB download and $1.50/GB storage/month. I&#8217;d love to see SimpleDB software that I could download and install, rather than hosted only. Even if I was going to use the hosted service, I&#8217;d like to develop against a non-hosted instance. </li>
<li>Research for sale! I was checking out the MS Research download feed and discovered a link to the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/msagl" target="_blank">Automatic Graph Layout</a> (MSAGL) library. This was previously called GLEE (Graph Layout Execution Engine) and was &#8220;free for non-commercial use&#8221;. Now, you can buy it for $295 <a href="http://www.windowsmarketplace.com/details.aspx?view=info&itemid=6002737" target="_blank">from Windows Marketplace</a> (though the previous free version is <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/0bbe180c-93c8-43f0-80fb-96e20d85a573/Details.aspx?0sr=d" target="_blank">still available</a>). The idea of directly commercializing research like this strikes me as pretty unusual. It must be a really good library.  </li>
<li>Scott Guthrie <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/14/new-asp-net-dynamic-data-support.aspx" target="_blank">shows off</a> the new Dynamic Data Support that will ship as part of the ASP.NET Extensions. I&#8217;m like, whatever. Scaffolding wasn&#8217;t that that interesting to me in RoR, so it&#8217;s no surprise that it&#8217;s not that interesting in ASP.NET.  </li>
