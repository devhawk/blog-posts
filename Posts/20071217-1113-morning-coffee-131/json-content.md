-   On a recommendation from my mother-in-law, I’ve been watching
    [Torchwood](http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/262/index.jsp). Sort
    of Men in Black, the series and set in Cardiff. Since it’s made in
    England, it’ll be one of the few shows still running in the new year
    due to the WGA strike.
-   A while back I pointed out that many DotNetKicks articles [were
    submitted by their
    authors](http://devhawk.net/2007/01/31/Morning+Coffee+21.aspx). I
    submitted a [few of my
    own](http://devhawk.net/2007/02/01/Morning+Coffee+22.aspx), just for
    kicks (har har), with [mixed
    results](http://devhawk.net/2007/02/02/Morning+Coffee+23.aspx).
    Today, I discovered that the [parse buffer
    post](http://devhawk.net/2007/12/11/Practical+F+Parsing+The+Parse+Buffer.aspx)
    from my [Practical Parsing in
    F\#](http://devhawk.net/2007/12/10/Practical+Parsing+In+F.aspx)
    series was
    [submitted](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/other/Practical_F_Parsing_Part_1_the_Parse_Buffer),
    picked up some kicks, and made it to the home page. That’s pretty
    cool. I guess writing more dev-focused articles is the way to go to
    get attention on DNK.
-   Amazon has rolled out a limited beta of
    [SimpleDB](http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&node=342335011&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA),
    which appears to be
    [S3](http://www.amazon.com/S3-AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&node=16427261&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA) +
    query support. Cost is based on usage: 14¢/hour for machine
    utilization, 10¢/GB upload, 13-18¢/GB download and \$1.50/GB
    storage/month. I’d love to see SimpleDB software that I could
    download and install, rather than hosted only. Even if I was going
    to use the hosted service, I’d like to develop against a non-hosted
    instance.
-   Research for sale! I was checking out the MS Research download feed
    and discovered a link to the [Automatic Graph
    Layout](http://research.microsoft.com/research/msagl) (MSAGL)
    library. This was previously called GLEE (Graph Layout Execution
    Engine) and was “free for non-commercial use”. Now, you can buy it
    for \$295 [from Windows
    Marketplace](http://www.windowsmarketplace.com/details.aspx?view=info&itemid=6002737)
    (though the previous free version is [still
    available](http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/0bbe180c-93c8-43f0-80fb-96e20d85a573/Details.aspx?0sr=d)).
    The idea of directly commercializing research like this strikes me
    as pretty unusual. It must be a really good library.
-   Scott Guthrie [shows
    off](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/14/new-asp-net-dynamic-data-support.aspx)
    the new Dynamic Data Support that will ship as part of the ASP.NET
    Extensions. I’m like, whatever. Scaffolding wasn’t that that
    interesting to me in RoR, so it’s no surprise that it’s not that
    interesting in ASP.NET.
-   Jeff “[Party With](http://www.partywithpalermo.com)” Palermo [blogs
    about the IoC
    support](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/12/11/mvccontrib-now-has-ioc-container-support-for-quot-the-big-3-quot.aspx)
    in the new [MVC Contrib](http://mvccontrib.org) project. Also looks
    like they’re
    [porting](http://mvccontrib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/MVCContrib/SimplyRestful/)
    RoR’s
    [simply\_restful](http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2006/8/1/simply-restful-in-rails-edge).
