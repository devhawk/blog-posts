<p>My father recommended I not blog politics, under the mistaken assumption that this is a "technical blog". For the record, this isn't a technical blog, it's my personal blog and I blog about what I'm interested in. Usually, it's technology, development and/or architecture. Sometimes it's <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=82882e47-cc0a-4b26-b795-779aa6c19265">hockey</a>. Sometimes it's <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=15467117-2c73-4933-a99a-751294d708f9">movies</a>. Right now, I'm abnormally interested in politics - go figure. I'm a week behind on tech blog reading, but I'm currently reading over a dozen political blogs every day. </p><p>This political "season" has had a significant effect on me. Call me a slow learner, but I'm beginning to figure out that politics isn't just something to think about once a year at election time - or worse, once every four years when at presidential election time. I'm sure regular readers can guess <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/">who I support</a> for president, but I haven't quite figured out how my new-found-interest in politics will effect my day-to-day life after Election Day. I won't bother you with any political reasoning (yet) since you've either made up your mind, in which case nothing I say will make a difference either way, or you haven't, in which case you're getting bombarded on all sides to make a decision and anything I say will be lost in the cacophony. But I do want to share one quote with you, which I found doing a little research:</p><blockquote><p>"Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force; like fire, a troublesome servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action."</p><p align="right">- George Washington</p></blockquote><p>Regardless of who wins in November, I will never turn my back on this troublesome servant and fearful master again.</p>
