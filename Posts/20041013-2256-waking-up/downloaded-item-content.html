<p>My father recommended I not blog politics, under the mistaken assumption that this is a &#8220;technical blog&#8221;. For the record, this isn&#8217;t a technical blog, it&#8217;s my personal blog and I blog about what I&#8217;m interested in. Usually, it&#8217;s technology, development and/or architecture. Sometimes it&#8217;s <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=82882e47-cc0a-4b26-b795-779aa6c19265">hockey</a>. Sometimes it&#8217;s <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=15467117-2c73-4933-a99a-751294d708f9">movies</a>. Right now, I&#8217;m abnormally interested in politics &#8211; go figure. I&#8217;m a week behind on tech blog reading, but I&#8217;m currently reading over a dozen political blogs every day. </p>
<p>This political &#8220;season&#8221; has had a significant effect on me. Call me a slow learner, but I&#8217;m beginning to figure out that politics isn&#8217;t just something to think about once a year at election time &#8211; or worse, once every four years when at presidential election time. I&#8217;m sure regular readers can guess <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/">who I support</a> for president, but I haven&#8217;t quite figured out how my new-found-interest in politics will effect my day-to-day life after Election Day. I won&#8217;t bother you with any political reasoning (yet) since you&#8217;ve either made up your mind, in which case nothing I say will make a difference either way, or you haven&#8217;t, in which case you&#8217;re getting bombarded on all sides to make a decision and anything I say will be lost in the cacophony. But I do want to share one quote with you, which I found doing a little research:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force; like fire, a troublesome servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of who wins in November, I will never turn my back on this troublesome servant and fearful master again.</p>
