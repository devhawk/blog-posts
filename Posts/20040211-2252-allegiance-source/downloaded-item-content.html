<p>Again, I&#8217;m late to the story but I think it&#8217;s ultra-cool that MS Research <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/allegiance/">released the source code to Allegiance </a>. At 511 MB, it&#8217;s almost thirty times bigger than <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/sscli">Rotor</a> + <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/clrgen/">Gyro</a>, which is a significant code release in itself, though honestly, only about 5% of the Allegiance archive is code, the 95% is in the &#8220;Artwork&#8221; subdirectory. That still leaves about 25MB of compressed code.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see a port to MC++, a la <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/homepageheadlines/quake/default.aspx">Quake II.NET</a>. Is anyone working on it?</p>
