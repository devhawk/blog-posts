	alternatives to the “decades-old” Windows console host. [Powershell
	Plus](http://www.powershell.com/plus/) looks awesome.
	[PoshConsole](http://www.codeplex.com/PoshConsole) also looks pretty
	cool (though far from finished yet) and is free.

	on the WL ID team blog. It looks like what Passport SDK provided for
	quite some time, but now it’s free. There’s also a [client auth

	conclusion](http://lsblog.wordpress.com/2007/08/17/enterprise-application-reality/)
	about [not
	differentiating](http://devhawk.net/2007/08/03/morning-coffee/)
	enterprise & support systems. Of course, different systems will have
	different availability requirements. But what happens when we connect
	them together? We can’t let the support system effect the availability
	of the enterprise system, right? To me, that implies either a) the
	support system now needs to conform to enterprise system availability
	requirements or b) we need some other mechanism (like async durable
	messaging) to act as a buffer between them. Personally, I like “b”.

	to](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/08/erps_troubled_l.php) an
	article [The Trouble with Enterprise
	Software](http://sloanreview.mit.edu/smr/issue/2007/fall/01/) by Cynthia
	Rettig. Cynthia writes that while the massive complexity of enterprise
	software, especially large-scale ERP systems like SAP, significantly
	hinder it’s value. It’s a must read. Choice quotes:
	-   “It is estimated that for every 25% increase in complexity in the
		tasks to be automated, the complexity of the software solution
		itself rises by 100%.”
	-   “The notion of reusable software works on a small scale. Programmers
		have successfully built and reused subroutines of standard
		functions. But as software grows more complex, reusability becomes a
		difficult or impossible task.”
	-   “Hope, unfortunately, has never been a very effective strategy.”
	-   “Is enterprise software just too complex to deliver on its promises?
		After all, enterprise systems were supposed to streamline and
		simplify business processes. Instead, they have brought high risks,
		uncertainty and a deeply worrying level of complexity. Rather than
		agility they have produced rigidity and unexpected barriers to
		change, a veritable glut of information containing myriad hidden
		errors, and a cloud of questions regarding their overall benefits.”
