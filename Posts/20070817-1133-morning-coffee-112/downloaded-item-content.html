It looks like what Passport SDK provided for quite some time, but now it&#8217;s free. There&#8217;s also a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=b5a78784-922d-4267-a6e9-5d2ecf1dced8&displaylang=en" target="_blank">client auth SDK</a> in development.

<li>Libor Soucek <a href="http://lsblog.wordpress.com/2007/08/17/enterprise-application-reality/" target="_blank">leaps to the wrong conclusion</a> about <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/08/03/Morning+Coffee.aspx" target="_blank">not differentiating</a> enterprise &amp; support systems. Of course, different systems will have different availability requirements. But what happens when we connect them together? We can&#8217;t let the support system effect the availability of the enterprise system, right? To me, that implies either a) the support system now needs to conform to enterprise system availability requirements or b) we need some other mechanism (like async durable messaging) to act as a buffer between them. Personally, I like &#8220;b&#8221;.  </li>
<li>Nick Carr <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/08/erps_troubled_l.php" target="_blank">points to</a> an article <a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/smr/issue/2007/fall/01/" target="_blank">The Trouble with Enterprise Software</a> by Cynthia Rettig. Cynthia writes that while the massive complexity of enterprise software, especially large-scale ERP systems like SAP, significantly hinder it&#8217;s value. It&#8217;s a must read. Choice quotes:</li>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;It is estimated that for every 25% increase in complexity in the tasks to be automated, the complexity of the software solution itself rises by 100%.&#8221; </li>
<li>&#8220;The notion of reusable software works on a small scale. Programmers have successfully built and reused subroutines of standard functions. But as software grows more complex, reusability becomes a difficult or impossible task.&#8221; </li>
<li>&#8220;Hope, unfortunately, has never been a very effective strategy.&#8221; </li>
<li>&#8220;Is enterprise software just too complex to deliver on its promises? After all, enterprise systems were supposed to streamline and simplify business processes. Instead, they have brought high risks, uncertainty and a deeply worrying level of complexity. Rather than agility they have produced rigidity and unexpected barriers to change, a veritable glut of information containing myriad hidden errors, and a cloud of questions regarding their overall benefits.&#8221;</li>
