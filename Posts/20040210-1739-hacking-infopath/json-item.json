Traditionally, I&#8217;d have to send out email asking everyone to send me this info, then manually cut-and-paste the results into an XML file. Instead, I whipped up an InfoPath form (well, truthfully, I whipped up several &#8211; but that&#8217;s just because I&#8217;m not familiar with the tool) and stuck it on a SharePoint site. Now, all my teammates can go fill out the form and I can merge the results together in one big XML file. All in under an hour, including learning curve. InfoPath even supports pictures, so my teammates can even provide a photo of themselves in the form. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not exactly uninstalling VS.NET, but it&#8217;s good to know how well InfoPath hits the mark for target scenarios like this one.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I had a few negative things to say about InfoPath a while back.
