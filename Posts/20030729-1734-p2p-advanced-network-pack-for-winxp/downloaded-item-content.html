<p>I didn&#8217;t notice, but the Advanced Networking Pack for WinXP was released last week. It&#8217;s available on Windows Update, or you can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/list/winxppeer.asp">download</a> it as well as the SDK from MSDN. The API is C based. That&#8217;s right. Not COM, not managed, not even C++ objects. Like I <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=f5a2c0c2-f96b-44f2-8a75-fc4d8e03993e">said</a> about the RTC Client v1.2 API, this API is ripe for wrapping in managed code.</p>
