I didn’t notice, but the Advanced Networking Pack for WinXP was released
last week. It’s available on Windows Update, or you can
[download](http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/list/winxppeer.asp) it as
well as the SDK from MSDN. The API is C based. That’s right. Not COM,
not managed, not even C++ objects. Like I
[said](PermaLink.aspx?guid=f5a2c0c2-f96b-44f2-8a75-fc4d8e03993e) about
the RTC Client v1.2 API, this API is ripe for wrapping in managed code.
