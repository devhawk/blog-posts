I just [joined The Lounge advertising
network](http://devhawk.net/2009/04/13/joining-the-lounge-advertising-network/)
so I wanted to pass along an opportunity to win a bunch of great
technical books.

The Lounge is asking the readers of the blogs in their network to [fill
out a
survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=Ijt7Q6LlWPxKcq2yflG_2bdg_3d_3d)
in order for them to improve how they target their advertising. It’s
pretty much what you would expect from an advertising network focused on
the .NET development platform: what language(s) do you use, what
framework(s), what testing tool(s), etc, etc, etc. Takes like three
minutes to fill out at most.

We all know that filling out surveys isn’t what most people consider
“exciting” or “fun”. In order to incent you, dear Reader, to take a few
minutes of your valuable time to fill out the survey, The Lounge is
giving away all forty one of Manning’s “In Action” books, including
[IronPython In Action](http://www.manning.com/foord/). Even if you don’t
win, you still get 40% discount off any purchase from Manning.

So it’s up to you, a scant few minutes of your time in exchange for a
chance to win enough technical books to keep you busy for months.
