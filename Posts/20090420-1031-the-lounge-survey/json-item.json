It\u2019s pretty much what you would expect from an advertising network focused on the .NET development platform: what language(s) do you use, what framework(s), what testing tool(s), etc, etc, etc. Takes like three minutes to fill out at most.<\/p>\n<p>We all know that filling out surveys isn\u2019t what most people consider \u201cexciting\u201d or \u201cfun\u201d. In order to incent you, dear Reader, to take a few minutes of your valuable time to fill out the survey, The Lounge is giving away all forty one of Manning\u2019s \u201cIn Action\u201d books, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.manning.com\/foord\/\">IronPython In Action<\/a>.
