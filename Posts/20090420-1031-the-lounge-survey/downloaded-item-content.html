<p>I just <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/04/13/Joining+The+Lounge+Advertising+Network.aspx">joined The Lounge advertising network</a> so I wanted to pass along an opportunity to win a bunch of great technical books.</p>
<p>The Lounge is asking the readers of the blogs in their network to <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=Ijt7Q6LlWPxKcq2yflG_2bdg_3d_3d">fill out a survey</a> in order for them to improve how they target their advertising. It&#8217;s pretty much what you would expect from an advertising network focused on the .NET development platform: what language(s) do you use, what framework(s), what testing tool(s), etc, etc, etc. Takes like three minutes to fill out at most.</p>
<p>We all know that filling out surveys isn&#8217;t what most people consider &#8220;exciting&#8221; or &#8220;fun&#8221;. In order to incent you, dear Reader, to take a few minutes of your valuable time to fill out the survey, The Lounge is giving away all forty one of Manning&#8217;s &#8220;In Action&#8221; books, including <a href="http://www.manning.com/foord/">IronPython In Action</a>. Even if you don&#8217;t win, you still get 40% discount off any purchase from Manning.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s up to you, a scant few minutes of your time in exchange for a chance to win enough technical books to keep you busy for months.</p>
