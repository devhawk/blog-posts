<p>I updated my theme to reflect the brand-spanking-new Tech&#183;Ed 2005 logo, which looks suspiciously like the now-obsolete Tech&#183;Ed&nbsp;2004 logo with different text. Luckily, there are palm trees in Orlando and San Diego.</p>
<p>Kidding aside, I will be at Tech&#183;Ed next year, again deeply involved in the Architecture Track.</p>
