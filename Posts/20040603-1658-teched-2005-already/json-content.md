I updated my theme to reflect the brand-spanking-new Tech·Ed 2005 logo,
which looks suspiciously like the now-obsolete Tech·Ed 2004 logo with
different text. Luckily, there are palm trees in Orlando and San Diego.

Kidding aside, I will be at Tech·Ed next year, again deeply involved in
the Architecture Track.
