<p>If you&#8217;re using the <a href="http://beta.toolbar.msn.com/">MSN Deskbar</a>, you might want to pick up <a href="http://www.grc.com">Gibson Research&#8217;s</a><a href="http://www.grc.com/wizmo/wizmo.htm">Wizmo</a>. Wizmo is a command line tool that provides a grab-bag of tools. Personally, I use it for the shutdown commands. I&#8217;ve mapped several of them to Deskbar shortcut, particularly &#8220;shutdown&#8221; and &#8220;shutdown!&#8221;. The exclamation point invokes the &#8220;damit&#8221; variation that overrides applications and/or device drivers that refuse to shutdown. I know a repave is in the near future when I&#8217;m find myself using shutdown! on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised Wizmo didn&#8217;t make <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/radiostories/2003/09/09/scottHanselmansUltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolsList.html">Scott&#8217;s Ultimate Power Tools</a> list.</p>
