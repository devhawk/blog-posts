In particular, he discusses the evolution of what consistency (and to less extent availability) means in the face of loose coupling.

Since I don&#8217;t &#8220;do&#8221; evangelism anymore, I don&#8217;t spend much time watching what our competitors are doing. According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.osoa.org\/display\/Main\/Service+Component+Architecture+Home\">SCA website<\/a>, SCA is supposedly a &#8220;a model for building applications and systems using a Service-Oriented Architecture.&#8221; But according to David, SCA 1.0 focuses on &#8220;portability, not interoperability, and so they don\u2019t fully define the interactions between components necessary to create composites that cross vendor boundaries.&#8221; I realize that we don&#8217;t industry agreement on all the details of what SOA means, but I think we all agree that it&#8217;s cross platform and cross vendor. Or maybe we can&#8217;t even agree on that much.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>These morning meetings are really cramping the &#8220;morning&#8221; style of these posts.
