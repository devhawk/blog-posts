<p>These morning meetings are really cramping the &#8220;morning&#8221; style of these posts. But better late than never, I guess.</p>
<ul>
<li>Politics 2.0 Watch: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/20/AR2007052001408.html">Democrats pwn Republicans online</a>. (via <a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/?p=8202">Balloon Juice</a>) </li>
<li>Roger Wolter <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rogerwolterblog/archive/2007/05/21/windows-wf-on-sql-service-broker.aspx">writes</a> about integrating SSB with WF, something I&#8217;ve experimented with myself.&nbsp;I didn&#8217;t find the integration quite as natural as Roger did &#8211; transactions are a real PITA, and&nbsp;Roger apparently he hasn&#8217;t looked into that yet&nbsp;- but I agree 100% with the idea that &#8220;most SSB programs end up looking a lot like a workflow.&#8221; Looking forward to seeing your code, Roger. </li>
<li>Pat <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/05/20/soa-and-newton-s-universe.aspx">explains</a> his Newton vs. Einstein view of distributed systems and then rants about Consistency, Availability and Partition-tolerance. In particular, he discusses the evolution of what consistency (and to less extent availability) means in the face of loose coupling. Do yourself a favor and give up on distributed transactions <em>now</em>. Also, Pat points to <a href="http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2007/papers/cidr07p36.pdf">another paper from CIDR</a> dealing with isolation in services. Haven&#8217;t read it yet, but I&#8217;ve added it to &#8220;the pile&#8221;. &nbsp; </li>
<li>David Chappell <a href="http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/2007/05/sca-vs-soa.html">writes</a> about Service Component Architecture vs. Service Oriented Architecture. Since I don&#8217;t &#8220;do&#8221; evangelism anymore, I don&#8217;t spend much time watching what our competitors are doing. According to the <a href="http://www.osoa.org/display/Main/Service+Component+Architecture+Home">SCA website</a>, SCA is supposedly a &#8220;a model for building applications and systems using a Service-Oriented Architecture.&#8221; But according to David, SCA 1.0 focuses on &#8220;portability, not interoperability, and so they don&#8217;t fully define the interactions between components necessary to create composites that cross vendor boundaries.&#8221; I realize that we don&#8217;t industry agreement on all the details of what SOA means, but I think we all agree that it&#8217;s cross platform and cross vendor. Or maybe we can&#8217;t even agree on that much.</li>
