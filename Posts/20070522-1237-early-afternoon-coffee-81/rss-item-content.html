<p>These morning meetings are really cramping the "morning" style of these posts. But better late than never, I guess.</p><ul><li>Politics 2.0 Watch: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/20/AR2007052001408.html">Democrats pwn Republicans online</a>. (via <a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/?p=8202">Balloon Juice</a>) </li><li>Roger Wolter <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rogerwolterblog/archive/2007/05/21/windows-wf-on-sql-service-broker.aspx">writes</a> about integrating SSB with WF, something I've experimented with myself. I didn't find the integration quite as natural as Roger did - transactions are a real PITA, and Roger apparently he hasn't looked into that yet - but I agree 100% with the idea that "most SSB programs end up looking a lot like a workflow." Looking forward to seeing your code, Roger. </li><li>Pat <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/05/20/soa-and-newton-s-universe.aspx">explains</a> his Newton vs. Einstein view of distributed systems and then rants about Consistency, Availability and Partition-tolerance. In particular, he discusses the evolution of what consistency (and to less extent availability) means in the face of loose coupling. Do yourself a favor and give up on distributed transactions <em>now</em>. Also, Pat points to <a href="http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2007/papers/cidr07p36.pdf">another paper from CIDR</a> dealing with isolation in services. Haven't read it yet, but I've added it to "the pile".   </li><li>David Chappell <a href="http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/2007/05/sca-vs-soa.html">writes</a> about Service Component Architecture vs. Service Oriented Architecture. Since I don't "do" evangelism anymore, I don't spend much time watching what our competitors are doing. According to the <a href="http://www.osoa.org/display/Main/Service+Component+Architecture+Home">SCA website</a>, SCA is supposedly a "a model for building applications and systems using a Service-Oriented Architecture." But according to David, SCA 1.0 focuses on "portability, not interoperability, and so they don’t fully define the interactions between components necessary to create composites that cross vendor boundaries." I realize that we don't industry agreement on all the details of what SOA means, but I think we all agree that it's cross platform and cross vendor. Or maybe we can't even agree on that much.</li></ul>
