<li>My two sessions on Rome went very well. Sort of like what I did @ TechEd last month, but with a bit more kimono opening since it was an internal audience. Best things about doing these types of talks is the questions and post-session conversation. I&#8217;ve missed that since moving over to MSIT.</li>
<li>Late last week, I got my phone switched over to the new Office Communications Server 2007 beta. In my old office, I used the <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/communicator/HA102027031033.aspx#2">Office Communicator PBX phone integration features</a> extensively. However, when we moved we got new IP phones that didn&#8217;t integrate with Communicator. So when a chance to get on the beta came along, I jumped. I&#8217;ll let you know my impressions after a few weeks, in the meantime you can <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/markdea/archive/2007/07/20/28-days-later.aspx">read about Mark Deakin&#8217;s experience</a>. </li>
<li>Matevz Gacnik <a href="http://www.request-response.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,bca19fa8-7ba8-43d8-873e-3a8cf03335cb.aspx">figures out</a> how to build a transactional web service that interacts with the new transactional file system in Vista and Server 08. Interesting, but personally I don&#8217;t believe in using transactional web services. The whole point of service orientation is to <em>reduce</em> the coupling between services. Trying two services (technically, a service consumer and provider) together in an atomic transaction seems like going in the wrong direction. Still, good on Matevz for digging into the transactional file system. </li>
<li>Udi Dahan gives us <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/07/19/6-simple-steps-to-becoming-a-top-it-consultant/">6 simple steps</a> to being a &#8220;top&#8221; IT consultant. I notice that getting well known, speaking and publishing are at the top of the list but actually being good at what you&#8217;re well known for comes in at #5 on the list. I&#8217;m sure Udi thinks that&#8217;s implicit in becoming a &#8220;top&#8221; consultant, but I&#8217;m not so sure. </li>
<li>Pat Helland thinks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/07/23/normalization-is-for-sissies.aspx">Normalization is for Sissies</a>. Slide #6 has the key take away: &#8220;For God&#8217;s Sake, Don&#8217;t Normalize Immutable Data&#8221;. </li>
<li>Larry O&#8217;Brien <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,df0a45e4-0add-4598-9ac7-409774232094.aspx">bashes</a> the new <strike>binary</strike> efficient XML <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/EXI/">working group</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/EXI/">working draft</a>. I agree 100% w/ Larry. These aren&#8217;t the droids we&#8217;re looking for. </li>
<li>John Evdemon <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2007/07/20/soa-in-the-real-world-now-available.aspx">points to</a> a new e-book from my old team called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=cb2a8e49-bb3b-49b6-b296-a2dfbbe042d8&displaylang=en">SOA in the Real World</a>. I flipped thru it (figuratively) and it appears to drill into the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa699418.aspx">Foundations of Solution Architecture</a> as well as provide real-world case studdies for each of the <strike>pillars</strike> recurring logical capabilities. Need to give it a deeper read.</li>
