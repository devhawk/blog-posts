  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA["but actually being good at what you're well known for comes in at #5 on the list. I'm sure Udi thinks that's implicit in becoming a "top" consultant, but I'm not so sure."

I think that one of the key differences between those who are perceived as top IT consultants and others who are knowledgable, valuable consultants is the exposure. This is often "the hard part" for those wanting to move up and make "the big bucks" :)

I think that being good is practically a prerequisite for anyone actually making a living from consulting.]]></wp:comment_content>
