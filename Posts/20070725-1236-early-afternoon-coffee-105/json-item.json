In my old office, I used the <a href=\"http:\/\/office.microsoft.com\/en-us\/communicator\/HA102027031033.aspx#2\">Office Communicator PBX phone integration features<\/a> extensively. However, when we moved we got new IP phones that didn&#8217;t integrate with Communicator. So when a chance to get on the beta came along, I jumped. I&#8217;ll let you know my impressions after a few weeks, in the meantime you can <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.technet.com\/markdea\/archive\/2007\/07\/20\/28-days-later.aspx\">read about Mark Deakin&#8217;s experience<\/a>. <\/li>\n<li>Matevz Gacnik <a href=\"http:\/\/www.request-response.com\/blog\/PermaLink,guid,bca19fa8-7ba8-43d8-873e-3a8cf03335cb.aspx\">figures out<\/a> how to build a transactional web service that interacts with the new transactional file system in Vista and Server 08. Interesting, but personally I don&#8217;t believe in using transactional web services. The whole point of service orientation is to <em>reduce<\/em> the coupling between services. Trying two services (technically, a service consumer and provider) together in an atomic transaction seems like going in the wrong direction. Still, good on Matevz for digging into the transactional file system. <\/li>\n<li>Udi Dahan gives us <a href=\"http:\/\/udidahan.weblogs.us\/2007\/07\/19\/6-simple-steps-to-becoming-a-top-it-consultant\/\">6 simple steps<\/a> to being a &#8220;top&#8221; IT consultant. I notice that getting well known, speaking and publishing are at the top of the list but actually being good at what you&#8217;re well known for comes in at #5 on the list. I&#8217;m sure Udi thinks that&#8217;s implicit in becoming a &#8220;top&#8221; consultant, but I&#8217;m not so sure. <\/li>\n<li>Pat Helland thinks <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/pathelland\/archive\/2007\/07\/23\/normalization-is-for-sissies.aspx\">Normalization is for Sissies<\/a>.

And of course, XML was created because companies couldn&#8217;t agree on standards in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>- By adding the Binary Elements to XML, the only good I could see coming from this is *possibly* additional layers \/ levels of security of data within the XML Structure.<\/p>\n<p>One of the earliest issues \/ problems that my former company had was that potential clients \/ customers would demand that their version be unique to them. For Example: AmEx demanded certain portions of the XML structure be included while others were dis-cluded (?) resulting in a slightly proprietary new AMEXML .<\/p>\n<p>Several others complained about the inherant openness of XML and how to secure the information in transit. This lead to a high utilization of EDI as more or less a transport layer or encryption of XML. This brought on a small boom for products such as XEDI (Pronounced Zee-Tea) to perform the EDI < -> XML translations.<\/p>\n<p>Whoopie. Back to the present.<\/p>\n<p>So now they want to re-invent the wheel so that binary code can be brought through a structured text file all over again. I think that people have &#8220;been there \/ done that&#8221;. It&#8217;s called UUENCODE. Get used to it.<\/p>\n<p>The problem itself seems to lie in that no-one has noticed that a similar company generic structure and way of allowing standard information passing and notification has been around for years in a slightly modified form. Is anyone familiar with a SNMP Walker ? Has anyone addressed the issues with transporting information \/ transforming data within the confines of SNMP yet ?<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think so, but then again, a Pessimist is never disappointed <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/p>\n","parent":0},{"id":2552,"name":"Udi Dahan - The Software Simplis","url":"http:\/\/udidahan.weblogs.us","date":"2007-07-28 14:17:07","content":"<p>&#8220;but actually being good at what you&#8217;re well known for comes in at #5 on the list.
