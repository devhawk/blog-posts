<ul><li>My two sessions on Rome went very well. Sort of like what I did @ TechEd last month, but with a bit more kimono opening since it was an internal audience. Best things about doing these types of talks is the questions and post-session conversation. I've missed that since moving over to MSIT.</li><li>Late last week, I got my phone switched over to the new Office Communications Server 2007 beta. In my old office, I used the <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/communicator/HA102027031033.aspx#2">Office Communicator PBX phone integration features</a> extensively. However, when we moved we got new IP phones that didn't integrate with Communicator. So when a chance to get on the beta came along, I jumped. I'll let you know my impressions after a few weeks, in the meantime you can <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/markdea/archive/2007/07/20/28-days-later.aspx">read about Mark Deakin's experience</a>. </li><li>Matevz Gacnik <a href="http://www.request-response.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,bca19fa8-7ba8-43d8-873e-3a8cf03335cb.aspx">figures out</a> how to build a transactional web service that interacts with the new transactional file system in Vista and Server 08. Interesting, but personally I don't believe in using transactional web services. The whole point of service orientation is to <em>reduce</em> the coupling between services. Trying two services (technically, a service consumer and provider) together in an atomic transaction seems like going in the wrong direction. Still, good on Matevz for digging into the transactional file system. </li><li>Udi Dahan gives us <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/07/19/6-simple-steps-to-becoming-a-top-it-consultant/">6 simple steps</a> to being a "top" IT consultant. I notice that getting well known, speaking and publishing are at the top of the list but actually being good at what you're well known for comes in at #5 on the list. I'm sure Udi thinks that's implicit in becoming a "top" consultant, but I'm not so sure. </li><li>Pat Helland thinks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/07/23/normalization-is-for-sissies.aspx">Normalization is for Sissies</a>.
