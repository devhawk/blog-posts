<p align="left">When it comes to processing XML, there are two basic approaches &#8211; load it all into memory at once or process it a node at a time. In the .NET world where I have spent most of the past ten years, those two models are represented by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.xml.xmldocument">XmlDocument</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.xml.xmlreader">XmlReader</a>. There are alternatives to XmlDocument, such as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.xml.linq.xdocument">XDocument</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.xml.xpath.xpathdocument">XPathDocument</a>, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Out in non-MSFT land, the same two basic models exist, however the de facto standard for stream based processing is SAX, the <a href="http://www.saxproject.org/">Simple API for XML</a>. SAX is supported by <a href="http://www.saxproject.org/langs.html">many languages</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-xml.sax.html">including Python</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve never been a fan of SAX&#8217;s event-driven approach. Pushing events makes total sense for a human driven UI, but I never understood why anyone thought that was a good idea for stream processing XML. I like XmlReader&#8217;s pull model much better. When you&#8217;re ready for the next node, just call <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.xml.xmlreader.Read">Read</a>() &#8211; no mucking about setting <a href="http://www.saxproject.org/apidoc/org/xml/sax/ContentHandler.html">content handlers</a> or handling node processing events. </p>
<p>Luckily, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html">Python standard library</a> supports both approaches. It provides both a <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-xml.sax.html">SAX based parser</a> as well as a <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-xml.dom.pulldom.html">pull based parser called pulldom</a>. Pulldom doc&#8217;s are fairly sparse, but <a href="http://www.prescod.net/">Paul Prescod</a> wrote a <a href="http://www.prescod.net/python/pulldom.html">nice introduction</a>. Here&#8217;s an example from Paul&#8217;s site (slightly modified):</p>
<pre class="brush: python">from xml.dom import pulldom 
nodes = pulldom.parse( &quot;file.xml&quot; )  
for (event,node) in nodes:  
    if event==&quot;START_ELEMENT&quot; and node.tagName==&quot;table&quot;:  
        nodes.expandNode( node )
</pre>
<p>Actually, I like this <em>better</em> than XmlReader, since it provides the nodes in a list-like construct that appeals to the functional programmer in me. I&#8217;d like it even more if Python had a native pattern matching syntax &#8211; you know, like F# &#8211; but you can get similar results by chaining together conditionals with <a href="http://docs.python.org/ref/if.html">elif</a>.</p>
<p>However, IronPython doesn&#8217;t support any of the XML parsing modules from Python&#8217;s standard library. They&#8217;re all based on a C-based python module called <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-xml.parsers.expat.html">pyexpat</a> which IronPython can&#8217;t load. [1] I wanted a pulldom type model, so I decided to wrap XmlReader to provide a similar API and lets me write code like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: python">import ipypulldom  
nodes = ipypulldom.parse( &quot;sample.xml&quot; )   
for node in nodes:   
  if node.nodeType==XmlNodeType.Element:   
    print node.xname
</pre>
<p>There are a few differences from pulldom, but it&#8217;s basically the same model. I&#8217;m using the native .NET type XmlNodeType rather than a string to indicate the node type. Furthermore, I made the node type a property of the node, rather than a separate variable. I also didn&#8217;t implement expandNode, though doing so would be a fairly straightforward combination of XmlReader.ReadSubtree and XmlDocument.Load.</p>
<p>I stuck the <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/IronPython%20Stuff/ipypulldom.py">code for ipypulldom</a> up in a new folder on my Skydrive: <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/IronPython%20Stuff">IronPython Stuff</a>. It&#8217;s fairly short &#8211; only about 45 lines of code. Feel free to use it if you need it.</p>

<p>[1] The <a href="http://fepy.sourceforge.net/">FePy project</a> has a <a href="https://fepy.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fepy/trunk/lib/pyexpat.py">.NET port of pyexpat</a> as part of their distribution, so I assume that lets you use the standard pulldom implementation in IPy. FePy looks really cool but I haven&#8217;t had time to dig into it yet. </p>
