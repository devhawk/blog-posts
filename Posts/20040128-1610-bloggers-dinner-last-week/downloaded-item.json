I had a great time. Scoble and I drove over with Deepak from the <a href=\"http:\/\/msntv.com\/pc\/default.aspx\">MSN TV<\/a> group. I spent quite a while talking to <a href=\"http:\/\/hyperthink.net\/blog\/\">Steve<\/a> about syndicating reference data, which builds on his recent SOA posts (more on that later). The coolest new thing this time was meeting Eric Promislow, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.activestate.com\/Corporate\/People\/Senior_Developers.html\">senior developer<\/a> with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.activestate.com\/\">ActiveState<\/a>. Eric is responsible for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.activestate.com\/Products\/Visual_Perl\/\">Visual Perl<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.activestate.com\/Products\/Visual_Python\/\">Visual Python<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.activestate.com\/Products\/Visual_XSLT\/\">Visual XSLT<\/a>\u00a0(and apparently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.baconizer.com\/\">the Baconizer<\/a>). One of the Visual XSLT developers was also there, but I missed his name (sorry). The three of us had a very interesting discussion on dynamic languages (something I know little about) and language design (something I know a moderate amount about). I know <a href=\"http:\/\/c2.com\/cgi\/wiki?WardCunningham\">Ward<\/a> is a perl guy, so maybe I should give Visual Perl a whirl.<\/p>\n<p>I also\u00a0got to <strike>rant about<\/strike> explain my\u00a0view of\u00a0SOA to <a href=\"http:\/\/radio.weblogs.com\/0001011\/\">Scoble<\/a> on the way home.
