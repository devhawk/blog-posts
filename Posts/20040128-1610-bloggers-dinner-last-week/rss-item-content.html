<p>I haven't had time to blog last weeks <a href="http://www.thenyoudiscover.com/weblog/archives/001520.html">blogger dinner</a> in Seattle. I had a great time. Scoble and I drove over with Deepak from the <a href="http://msntv.com/pc/default.aspx">MSN TV</a> group. I spent quite a while talking to <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/">Steve</a> about syndicating reference data, which builds on his recent SOA posts (more on that later). The coolest new thing this time was meeting Eric Promislow, a <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Corporate/People/Senior_Developers.html">senior developer</a> with <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a>. Eric is responsible for <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Visual_Perl/">Visual Perl</a>, <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Visual_Python/">Visual Python</a> and <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Visual_XSLT/">Visual XSLT</a> (and apparently <a href="http://www.baconizer.com/">the Baconizer</a>). One of the Visual XSLT developers was also there, but I missed his name (sorry). The three of us had a very interesting discussion on dynamic languages (something I know little about) and language design (something I know a moderate amount about). I know <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward</a> is a perl guy, so maybe I should give Visual Perl a whirl.</p><p>I also got to <strike>rant about</strike> explain my view of SOA to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> on the way home. Lucky him.</p>
