-   After using Outlook 2007 as my RSS reader for a few months, I’ve
    gone back to [RSS Bandit](http://www.rssbandit.org/). I run two work
    machines (desktop + laptop) and I finally got tired duplicated blog
    entries because each copy of Outlook downloads the same post. Also,
    for some reason Outlook downloads the same Technorati posts over and
    over again.
-   ADO.NET [Entity Framework Beta
    3](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=15DB9989-1621-444D-9B18-D1A04A21B519&displaylang=en)
    was released. The [latest CTP of the EF
    Tools](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D8AE4404-8E05-41FC-94C8-C73D9E238F82&displaylang=en)
    is also available. And as per the [press
    release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/dec07/12-06EntityBeta3PR.mspx),
    EF has gained support from “Core Lab, DataDirect Technologies,
    Firebird Foundation Inc., IBM Corp., MySQL AB, Npgsql , OpenLink
    Software Inc., Phoenix Software International, Sybase Inc. and
    VistaDB Software Inc”. I’m not sure what that means, exactly, but I
    guess you’ll be able to LINQ to Entities on a wide variety of DB
    platforms. Interesting Oracle isn’t on that list. Not really
    surprising, but interesting.
-   Here’s a new [ASP.NET MVC
    article](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/06/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-3-passing-viewdata-from-controllers-to-views.aspx)
    from Scott Guthrie, this one on views and how you pass data to one
    from a controller. Using generics to get strongly-typed ViewData is
    pretty sweet. But where’s the MVC CTP that was supposed to be here
    this week?
-   In news about web app tool previews that did ship this week, Live
    Labs announces [Volta](http://labs.live.com/Volta.aspx). Haven’t
    installed or played with it yet, but I did read the [fundamentals
    page](http://labs.live.com/volta/docs/). It primarily looks like a
    tool to compile MSIL -\> JavaScript, so you can write your code in
    C\# but execute it in the browser.
    [Sam](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/12/05/microsoft-live-labs-volta.aspx)
    and
    [Jesus](http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/12/06/announcing-volta.aspx)
    are excited,
    [Arnon](http://www.rgoarchitects.com/nblog/2007/12/06/MicrosoftVoltaOhMyOhMy.aspx)
    not so much. Arnon’s argument that being able to postponing
    architectural decisions is to good to be true is fairly compelling,
    and not just because he [quotes
    me](http://www.devhawk.net/2007/08/14/Retire+The+Tenets.aspx) to
    support his argument. But I’ll download it and provide further
    comment after I experiment with it myself.
-   Simple Sharing Extensions is now
    [FeedSync](http://dev.live.com/feedsync). Not sure what else is new
    about it, other than it’s been blessed with “1.0″ status. The Live
    FeedSync Dev Center has an
    [introduction](http://dev.live.com/feedsync/intro.aspx), a
    [tutorial](http://dev.live.com/feedsync/tutorial/) and the
    [spec](http://dev.live.com/feedsync/spec/v1.htm). (via
    [LiveSide](http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2007/12/05/microsoft-launches-feedsync-for-data-synchronization-via-feeds-previously-known-as-sse.aspx))
-   Dare [likes
    tuples](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/12/05/TuplesAreMyFavoritePythonFeature.aspx).
    [Me
    too](http://devhawk.net/2006/08/21/language-features-i-wish-c-had-tuples/).
    I [also like
