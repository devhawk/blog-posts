I run two work machines (desktop + laptop) and I finally got tired duplicated blog entries because each copy of Outlook downloads the same post. Also, for some reason Outlook downloads the same Technorati posts over and over again.  <\/li>\n<li>ADO.NET <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyId=15DB9989-1621-444D-9B18-D1A04A21B519&amp;displaylang=en\">Entity Framework Beta 3<\/a> was released. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyId=D8AE4404-8E05-41FC-94C8-C73D9E238F82&amp;displaylang=en\">latest CTP of the EF Tools<\/a> is also available. And as per the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/press\/2007\/dec07\/12-06EntityBeta3PR.mspx\">press release<\/a>, EF has gained support from &#8220;Core Lab, DataDirect Technologies, Firebird Foundation Inc., IBM Corp., MySQL AB, Npgsql , OpenLink Software Inc., Phoenix Software International, Sybase Inc. and VistaDB Software Inc&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure what that means, exactly, but I guess you&#8217;ll be able to LINQ to Entities on a wide variety of DB platforms. Interesting Oracle isn&#8217;t on that list. Not really surprising, but interesting.  <\/li>\n<li>Here&#8217;s a new <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2007\/12\/06\/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-3-passing-viewdata-from-controllers-to-views.aspx\">ASP.NET MVC article<\/a> from Scott Guthrie, this one on views and how you pass data to one from a controller. Using generics to get strongly-typed ViewData is pretty sweet. But where&#8217;s the MVC CTP that was supposed to be here this week?  <\/li>\n<li>In news about web app tool previews that did ship this week, Live Labs announces <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.live.com\/Volta.aspx\">Volta<\/a>. Haven&#8217;t installed or played with it yet, but I did read the <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.live.com\/volta\/docs\/\">fundamentals page<\/a>. It primarily looks like a tool to compile MSIL -&gt; JavaScript, so you can write your code in C# but execute it in the browser. <a href=\"http:\/\/samgentile.com\/blogs\/samgentile\/archive\/2007\/12\/05\/microsoft-live-labs-volta.aspx\">Sam<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/gsusx\/archive\/2007\/12\/06\/announcing-volta.aspx\">Jesus<\/a> are excited, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rgoarchitects.com\/nblog\/2007\/12\/06\/MicrosoftVoltaOhMyOhMy.aspx\">Arnon<\/a> not so much. Arnon&#8217;s argument that being able to postponing architectural decisions is to good to be true is fairly compelling, and not just because he <a href=\"http:\/\/www.devhawk.net\/2007\/08\/14\/Retire+The+Tenets.aspx\">quotes me<\/a> to support his argument. But I&#8217;ll download it and provide further comment after I experiment with it myself.  <\/li>\n<li>Simple Sharing Extensions is now <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.live.com\/feedsync\">FeedSync<\/a>. Not sure what else is new about it, other than it&#8217;s been blessed with &#8220;1.0&#8243; status. The Live FeedSync Dev Center has an <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.live.com\/feedsync\/intro.aspx\">introduction<\/a>, a <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.live.com\/feedsync\/tutorial\/\">tutorial<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.live.com\/feedsync\/spec\/v1.htm\">spec<\/a>.
