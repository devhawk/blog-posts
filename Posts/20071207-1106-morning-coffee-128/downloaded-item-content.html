<li>After using Outlook 2007 as my RSS reader for a few months, I&#8217;ve gone back to <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSS Bandit</a>. I run two work machines (desktop + laptop) and I finally got tired duplicated blog entries because each copy of Outlook downloads the same post. Also, for some reason Outlook downloads the same Technorati posts over and over again.  </li>
<li>ADO.NET <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=15DB9989-1621-444D-9B18-D1A04A21B519&displaylang=en">Entity Framework Beta 3</a> was released. The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D8AE4404-8E05-41FC-94C8-C73D9E238F82&displaylang=en">latest CTP of the EF Tools</a> is also available. And as per the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/dec07/12-06EntityBeta3PR.mspx">press release</a>, EF has gained support from &#8220;Core Lab, DataDirect Technologies, Firebird Foundation Inc., IBM Corp., MySQL AB, Npgsql , OpenLink Software Inc., Phoenix Software International, Sybase Inc. and VistaDB Software Inc&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure what that means, exactly, but I guess you&#8217;ll be able to LINQ to Entities on a wide variety of DB platforms. Interesting Oracle isn&#8217;t on that list. Not really surprising, but interesting.  </li>
<li>Here&#8217;s a new <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/06/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-3-passing-viewdata-from-controllers-to-views.aspx">ASP.NET MVC article</a> from Scott Guthrie, this one on views and how you pass data to one from a controller. Using generics to get strongly-typed ViewData is pretty sweet. But where&#8217;s the MVC CTP that was supposed to be here this week?  </li>
<li>In news about web app tool previews that did ship this week, Live Labs announces <a href="http://labs.live.com/Volta.aspx">Volta</a>. Haven&#8217;t installed or played with it yet, but I did read the <a href="http://labs.live.com/volta/docs/">fundamentals page</a>. It primarily looks like a tool to compile MSIL -&gt; JavaScript, so you can write your code in C# but execute it in the browser. <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/12/05/microsoft-live-labs-volta.aspx">Sam</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/12/06/announcing-volta.aspx">Jesus</a> are excited, <a href="http://www.rgoarchitects.com/nblog/2007/12/06/MicrosoftVoltaOhMyOhMy.aspx">Arnon</a> not so much. Arnon&#8217;s argument that being able to postponing architectural decisions is to good to be true is fairly compelling, and not just because he <a href="http://www.devhawk.net/2007/08/14/Retire+The+Tenets.aspx">quotes me</a> to support his argument. But I&#8217;ll download it and provide further comment after I experiment with it myself.  </li>
<li>Simple Sharing Extensions is now <a href="http://dev.live.com/feedsync">FeedSync</a>. Not sure what else is new about it, other than it&#8217;s been blessed with &#8220;1.0&#8243; status. The Live FeedSync Dev Center has an <a href="http://dev.live.com/feedsync/intro.aspx">introduction</a>, a <a href="http://dev.live.com/feedsync/tutorial/">tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://dev.live.com/feedsync/spec/v1.htm">spec</a>. (via <a href="http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2007/12/05/microsoft-launches-feedsync-for-data-synchronization-via-feeds-previously-known-as-sse.aspx">LiveSide</a>)  </li>

I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/08/22/Language+Features+I+Wish+C+Had+Symbols.aspx">also like symbols</a>. </li>
