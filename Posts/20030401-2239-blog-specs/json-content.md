Between work and
[Patrick](http://groups.msn.com/harrypiersonphotos/patrickharoldpierson.msnw),
I haven’t had much time to blog. Plus, I’ve been [rethinking the backend
of this blog](http://devhawk.net/2003/03/26/varchar/).
Thus, the more I blog now, the more I’ll have to migrate later. \<sigh\>

I want to upgrade by backend so I can more easily keep up with
[Don](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/) and
[Sam](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/) and [changes in
blogspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/spoutletex.aspx?key=2003-03-30T04:44:35Z).
Here is the list of blog-related enhancements I want to make:

-   [\<xhtml:body\>](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/) in my
    [RSS](http://backend.userland.com/rss)
-   [Trackback](http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/) and
    [Pingback](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback)
-   [Comments](http://wellformedweb.org/story/9)
-   Ping [Weblogs.com](http://newhome.weblogs.com/faq) (plus
    [blo.gs](http://blo.gs/),
    [blogtracker](http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker/),
    [BlogRolling](http://www.blogrolling.com/) and
    [BlogShares](http://www.blogshares.com/))

What am I missing? Is there a definitive list of all the blog related
specs?
