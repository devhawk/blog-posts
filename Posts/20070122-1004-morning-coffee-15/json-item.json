Actually, it&#8217;s worse than it looks. The effect of any instruction depends on where it is located in memory.\u00a0\u00a0Malbolge is so difficult, it took <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acooke.org\/andrew\/writing\/malbolge.html\">a month to write a Lisp program<\/a> to generate that program. However, Lou Scheffer thinks we should think about Malbolge as a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lscheffer.com\/malbolge.shtml\">cryptosystem<\/a>. I wonder if it could be used for obfuscation?

He makes the point about &#8220;them to think in terms of small steps&#8221;. I was lucky to have a computer teacher in elementary school who did something similar. She had us write down instructions for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and she then followed them to the letter. For example, if you wrote, &#8220;spread peanut butter on the bread&#8221; with out first instructing her to take out a slice, she&#8217;d happily spread peanut butter on the entire loaf.
