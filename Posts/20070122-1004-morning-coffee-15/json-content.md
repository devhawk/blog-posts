-   I was checking out the [ASP.NET community
    site](http://www.asp.net/), and I noticed a small “Microsoft
    Communities” toolbar across the top. There’s a little menu that
    links to other MS community sites like [Channel
    9](http://channel9.msdn.com/) and [MSDN
    Blogs](http://blogs.msdn.com/). I’m surprised the [NetFx3 community
    site](http://www.netfx3.com/) isn’t included.
-   My teammate Dale is blogging about Proper SOA. He lays out [6 Proper
    SOA
    principles](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!309.entry),
    and then drills into the first three: [meets business
    needs](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!311.entry),
    [requires
    governance](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!312.entry)
    and [responds to changing business
    drivers](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!313.entry).
    I expect to see posts on the remaining principles this week. Maybe
    Dale should turn this series into an article.
-   Speaking of articles about architecture, Architecture Journal 10 is
    [online as a
    PDF](http://www.msarchitecturejournal.com/pdf/Journal10.pdf). This
    issue’s topic is Composite Applications.
-   [Malbolge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge_programming_language)
    is a programming lanugage that is “specifically designed to be
    difficult to program in.” Here’s [Hello
    World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world) in Malbolge:
    <div
    style="MARGIN-TOP: 10px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px; MARGIN-LEFT: 20px">

    `` (=<`$9]7<5YXz7wT.3,+O/o'K%$H"'~D|#z@b=`{^Lx8%$Xmrkpohm-kNi;gsedcba`_^][ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA@?>=<;:9876543s+O<olm ``

    </div>

    Seriously. Actually, it’s worse than it looks. The effect of any
    instruction depends on where it is located in memory.  Malbolge is
    so difficult, it took [a month to write a Lisp
    program](http://www.acooke.org/andrew/writing/malbolge.html) to
    generate that program. However, Lou Scheffer thinks we should think
    about Malbolge as a
    [cryptosystem](http://www.lscheffer.com/malbolge.shtml). I wonder if
    it could be used for obfuscation? (via [Good Math, Bad
    Math](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/01/hellish_programming_malbolge.php))
-   Nat Torkington blogs about [teaching kids to
    program](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/01/why_johnny_cant.html).
    He makes the point about “them to think in terms of small steps”. I
    was lucky to have a computer teacher in elementary school who did
    something similar. She had us write down instructions for making a
    peanut butter and jelly sandwich and she then followed them to the
    letter. For example, if you wrote, “spread peanut butter on the
    bread” with out first instructing her to take out a slice, she’d
    happily spread peanut butter on the entire loaf. (via
    [reddit](http://programming.reddit.com/))
-   To this day, my wife thinks the peanut butter and jelly lesson
    negatively affected my ability to communicate with “normal” people.
    She’ll even say “peanut butter and jelly” when she thinks I’m being
    particularly obtuse in my communication.
