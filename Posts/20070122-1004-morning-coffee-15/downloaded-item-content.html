<li>I was checking out the <a href="http://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET community site</a>, and I noticed a small &#8220;Microsoft Communities&#8221; toolbar across the top. There&#8217;s a little menu that links to other MS community sites like <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/">MSDN Blogs</a>. I&#8217;m surprised the <a href="http://www.netfx3.com/">NetFx3 community site</a> isn&#8217;t included.

<li>My teammate Dale is blogging about Proper SOA. He lays out <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!309.entry">6 Proper SOA principles</a>, and then drills into the first three: <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!311.entry">meets business needs</a>, <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!312.entry">requires governance</a> and <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!313.entry">responds to changing business drivers</a>. I expect to see posts on the remaining principles this week. Maybe Dale should turn this series into an article.

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge_programming_language">Malbolge</a> is a programming lanugage that is &#8220;specifically designed to be difficult to program in.&#8221; Here&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world">Hello World</a> in Malbolge:
<div style="MARGIN-TOP: 10px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px; MARGIN-LEFT: 20px"><code>(=&lt;`$9]7&lt;5YXz7wT.3,+O/o'K%$H&quot;'~D|#z@b=`{^Lx8%$Xmrkpohm-kNi;gsedcba`_^][ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA@?&gt;=&lt;;:9876543s+O&lt;olm</code></div>
<p>Seriously. Actually, it&#8217;s worse than it looks. The effect of any instruction depends on where it is located in memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Malbolge is so difficult, it took <a href="http://www.acooke.org/andrew/writing/malbolge.html">a month to write a Lisp program</a> to generate that program. However, Lou Scheffer thinks we should think about Malbolge as a <a href="http://www.lscheffer.com/malbolge.shtml">cryptosystem</a>. I wonder if it could be used for obfuscation?

<li>Nat Torkington blogs about <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/01/why_johnny_cant.html">teaching kids to program</a>. He makes the point about &#8220;them to think in terms of small steps&#8221;. I was lucky to have a computer teacher in elementary school who did something similar. She had us write down instructions for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and she then followed them to the letter. For example, if you wrote, &#8220;spread peanut butter on the bread&#8221; with out first instructing her to take out a slice, she&#8217;d happily spread peanut butter on the entire loaf.

<li>To this day, my wife thinks the peanut butter and jelly lesson negatively affected my ability to communicate with &#8220;normal&#8221; people. She&#8217;ll even say &#8220;peanut butter and jelly&#8221; when she thinks I&#8217;m being particularly obtuse in my communication. </li>
