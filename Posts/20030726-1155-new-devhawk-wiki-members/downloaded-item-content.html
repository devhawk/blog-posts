<p>I just added 3 members to the <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=9513f6ed-41c2-4c0f-a5d6-730371bb4b45"> DevHawk Wiki Workspace</a>. However, one of them commented that they thought joining was the only way to get the source code. I just logged in w/ an alternate passport to test this: couldn&#8217;t check out or check in as a non-member, but I was able to get the latest version using the Windows Forms Control GDN source code interface. You do need to be a workspace member if you want to use the VS.NET integration.</p>
