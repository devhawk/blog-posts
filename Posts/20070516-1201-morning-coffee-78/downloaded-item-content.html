<li>I wrote yesterday that Pat Helland&#8217;s first post back was light on the tech talk. Luckily (for us) he takes the bus to work so he has plenty of time to write blog entries. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/05/15/memories-guesses-and-apologies.aspx">Today&#8217;s post</a> is his &#8220;personal opinion about how computers suck&#8221;. Money Quote: &#8220;We try too hard as an industry.&nbsp; Frequently, we build big and expensive datacenters and deploy big and expensive computers. In many cases, comparable behavior can be achieved with a lot of crappy machines which cost less than the big expensive one.&#8221; </li>
<li>Steve Jones wrote that <a href="http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/2007/05/crud-is-crap.html">CRUD is CRAP</a>. I agree 100%, but for additional reasons. Not only is it boooooring to write, it also delegates control <em>outside </em>of the service which I think is a mistake. Check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/maarten_mullender/archive/2004/07/23/193524.aspx">this post</a> from Maarten Mullender who advised to do CRUD only when you can afford it. </li>
<li>MIT Media Lab has created <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>&nbsp;&#8220;a new programming language that makes it easy to create your own interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art &#8212; and share your creations on the web&#8221; targeted at kids 8 and up. It&#8217;s a dynamic visual programming language that looks like Lego.&nbsp;Between Scratch, <a href="http://on10.net/Blogs/laura/techfest-07-boku/">Boku</a> and <a href="http://phrogram.com">Phrogram</a> I think my kids will have lots of fun learning to program like daddy does.

<li>Halo 3 is coming <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/05/15/AreYouReadyforHalo.aspx">September 25th</a>! I foresee lots of people calling in sick that day. And the next. And the rest of the week, etc. etc. etc.</li>
