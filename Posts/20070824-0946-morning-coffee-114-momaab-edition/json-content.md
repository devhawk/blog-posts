-   We spent all day yesterday discussing four topics: SaaS, Tools for
    Scrum, Web 2.0 and Domain Specific Languages. Even though it was
    just a day, my brain is full. These were deep and challenging
    discussion. I need to let the discussions stew a bit before posting
    anything about them here. But I will.
-   Next time we do one of these, I’m bringing a video camera. I took
    notes, but looking over them the next morning they seem woefully
    incomplete. OneNote’s [integrated audio/video recording
    capabilities](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/CH102381791033.aspx)
    would nicely augment my notes.
-   We ran this meeting using [Open
    Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology), and it
    worked very well. Of course, we only had 8 people, so we didn’t need
    a lot of process to self organize. However, it did whet my appetite
    for having a larger Open Space style un-conference for architects.
    Is that something other folks might be interested in?
-   Major thanks to the folks at [Clarity
    Consulting](http://www.claritycon.com/) who graciously gave us space
    to meet and fed us yesterday. Their CTO ****[Jon
    Rauschenberger](http://blogs.claritycon.com/blogs/jon_rauschenberger/default.aspx)
    sat in on most of our meeting, and drove our Web 2.0 discussion. I
    said I wanted to stew a bit on the discussions, but [Jon’s
    slides](http://www.claritycon.com/arcready) are available on line if
    you’re interested.
-   [Scott Colestock](http://www.traceofthought.net/) showed me
    [Diigo](http://www.diigo.com/), a social annotation tool. Where
    del.icio.us lets you tag and annotate individual pages, Diigo lets
    you annotate and highlight specific parts of the page. They also
    have [blogging tools](http://www.diigo.com/help/blog/2), where these
    annotations and highlights become blog posts, but they [don’t
    support dasBlog](http://www.diigo.com/help/blog/3). However, since
    FeedBurner doesn’t support Diigo for [link
    splicing](http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2004/08/introducing_the_link_splicer.php),
    I’m afraid my use of it will be limited.
-   [Jim
    Wilt](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/architect/bios/jim_wilt/default.mspx)
    introduced me to [Virtual PC’s command
    line](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831501). He recommends using
    “-pc \<vpc name\> -launch -singlepc” which launches a single virtual
    environment without the VPC console. I rarely run more than one VPC
    at a time and I hate stuff cluttering up my taskbar and notification
    area, so I like this a lot.
-   [Loren Goodman](http://www.inrule.com/Management_Team.aspx)
    demonstrated the [SharePoint Explorer
    Client](http://www.thedotnetfactory.com/SharePointExplorerClient.aspx).
    SharePoint & MOSS came up several times in all of our topics, so
    this is going to get a second look. I always thought it was strange
    that MSFT ships a [smart client for
    editing](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointdesigner/default.aspx)
    WSS & MOSS, but not viewing it. SP Explorer looks like it fills that
    gap nicely.
-   [Shannon Braun](http://www.sysknowlogy.com/) sent us all a link to
    [the 50/70
    rule](http://www.nealwhittengroup.com/articles/pmn10-99.asp), which
    seems like a good rule of thumb. Of course, assuming that things
    won’t progress linearly is almost always a good rule of thumb. But
    the 50/70 rule has reasoning behind the assumption.
-   Chicago is nice, but the weather has been a little freaky. It’s
    either been hot & humid, downporing thunderstorms or
    [tornados](http://www.wandtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=6974859). [Keith
    Powell](http://www.kavp.com/) showed me
    [FlightAware](http://flightaware.com/), which shows you flight
    departure and arrival history. My flight hasn’t left within an hour
    of scheduled departure in a week. I’m going to try and grab an
    earlier flight, but I have a feeling it’s going to be a long trip
    home.
