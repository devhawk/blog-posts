<li>We spent all day yesterday discussing four topics: SaaS, Tools for Scrum, Web 2.0 and Domain Specific Languages. Even though it was just a day, my brain is full. These were deep and challenging discussion. I need to let the discussions stew a bit before posting anything about them here. But I will. </li>
<li>Next time we do one of these, I&#8217;m bringing a video camera. I took notes, but looking over them the next morning they seem woefully incomplete. OneNote&#8217;s <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/CH102381791033.aspx">integrated audio/video recording capabilities</a> would nicely augment my notes. </li>
<li>We ran this meeting using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space</a>, and it worked very well. Of course, we only had 8 people, so we didn&#8217;t need a lot of process to self organize. However, it did whet my appetite for having a larger Open Space style un-conference for architects. Is that something other folks might be interested in? </li>
<li>Major thanks to the folks at <a href="http://www.claritycon.com/">Clarity Consulting</a> who graciously gave us space to meet and fed us yesterday. Their CTO <strong></strong><a href="http://blogs.claritycon.com/blogs/jon_rauschenberger/default.aspx">Jon Rauschenberger</a> sat in on most of our meeting, and drove our Web 2.0 discussion. I said I wanted to stew a bit on the discussions, but <a href="http://www.claritycon.com/arcready">Jon&#8217;s slides</a> are available on line if you&#8217;re interested. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.traceofthought.net/">Scott Colestock</a> showed me <a href="http://www.diigo.com/">Diigo</a>, a social annotation tool. Where del.icio.us lets you tag and annotate individual pages, Diigo lets you annotate and highlight specific parts of the page. They also have <a href="http://www.diigo.com/help/blog/2">blogging tools</a>, where these annotations and highlights become blog posts, but they <a href="http://www.diigo.com/help/blog/3">don&#8217;t support dasBlog</a>. However, since FeedBurner doesn&#8217;t support Diigo for <a href="http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2004/08/introducing_the_link_splicer.php">link splicing</a>, I&#8217;m afraid my use of it will be limited. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/architect/bios/jim_wilt/default.mspx">Jim Wilt</a> introduced me to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831501">Virtual PC&#8217;s command line</a>. He recommends using &#8220;-pc &lt;vpc name&gt; -launch -singlepc&#8221; which launches a single virtual environment without the VPC console. I rarely run more than one VPC at a time and I hate stuff cluttering up my taskbar and notification area, so I like this a lot. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.inrule.com/Management_Team.aspx">Loren Goodman</a> demonstrated the <a href="http://www.thedotnetfactory.com/SharePointExplorerClient.aspx">SharePoint Explorer Client</a>. SharePoint &amp; MOSS came up several times in all of our topics, so this is going to get a second look. I always thought it was strange that MSFT ships a <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointdesigner/default.aspx">smart client for editing</a> WSS &amp; MOSS, but not viewing it. SP Explorer looks like it fills that gap nicely. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.sysknowlogy.com/">Shannon Braun</a> sent us all a link to <a href="http://www.nealwhittengroup.com/articles/pmn10-99.asp">the 50/70 rule</a>, which seems like a good rule of thumb. Of course, assuming that things won&#8217;t progress linearly is almost always a good rule of thumb. But the 50/70 rule has reasoning behind the assumption. </li>
<li>Chicago is nice, but the weather has been a little freaky. It&#8217;s either been hot &amp; humid, downporing thunderstorms or <a href="http://www.wandtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=6974859">tornados</a>. <a href="http://www.kavp.com/">Keith Powell</a> showed me <a href="http://flightaware.com/">FlightAware</a>, which shows you flight departure and arrival history. My flight hasn&#8217;t left within an hour of scheduled departure in a week. I&#8217;m going to try and grab an earlier flight, but I have a feeling it&#8217;s going to be a long trip home.</li>
