Even though it was just a day, my brain is full. These were deep and challenging discussion. I need to let the discussions stew a bit before posting anything about them here. But I will. <\/li>\n<li>Next time we do one of these, I&#8217;m bringing a video camera. I took notes, but looking over them the next morning they seem woefully incomplete. OneNote&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/office.microsoft.com\/en-us\/onenote\/CH102381791033.aspx\">integrated audio\/video recording capabilities<\/a> would nicely augment my notes. <\/li>\n<li>We ran this meeting using <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Open_Space_Technology\">Open Space<\/a>, and it worked very well. Of course, we only had 8 people, so we didn&#8217;t need a lot of process to self organize. However, it did whet my appetite for having a larger Open Space style un-conference for architects. Is that something other folks might be interested in? <\/li>\n<li>Major thanks to the folks at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.claritycon.com\/\">Clarity Consulting<\/a> who graciously gave us space to meet and fed us yesterday. Their CTO <strong><\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.claritycon.com\/blogs\/jon_rauschenberger\/default.aspx\">Jon Rauschenberger<\/a> sat in on most of our meeting, and drove our Web 2.0 discussion. I said I wanted to stew a bit on the discussions, but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.claritycon.com\/arcready\">Jon&#8217;s slides<\/a> are available on line if you&#8217;re interested. <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.traceofthought.net\/\">Scott Colestock<\/a> showed me <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diigo.com\/\">Diigo<\/a>, a social annotation tool. Where del.icio.us lets you tag and annotate individual pages, Diigo lets you annotate and highlight specific parts of the page. They also have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diigo.com\/help\/blog\/2\">blogging tools<\/a>, where these annotations and highlights become blog posts, but they <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diigo.com\/help\/blog\/3\">don&#8217;t support dasBlog<\/a>. However, since FeedBurner doesn&#8217;t support Diigo for <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.feedburner.com\/feedburner\/archives\/2004\/08\/introducing_the_link_splicer.php\">link splicing<\/a>, I&#8217;m afraid my use of it will be limited. <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/learning\/mcp\/architect\/bios\/jim_wilt\/default.mspx\">Jim Wilt<\/a> introduced me to <a href=\"http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/kb\/831501\">Virtual PC&#8217;s command line<\/a>. He recommends using &#8220;-pc &lt;vpc name&gt; -launch -singlepc&#8221; which launches a single virtual environment without the VPC console. I rarely run more than one VPC at a time and I hate stuff cluttering up my taskbar and notification area, so I like this a lot. <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.inrule.com\/Management_Team.aspx\">Loren Goodman<\/a> demonstrated the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedotnetfactory.com\/SharePointExplorerClient.aspx\">SharePoint Explorer Client<\/a>. SharePoint &amp; MOSS came up several times in all of our topics, so this is going to get a second look. I always thought it was strange that MSFT ships a <a href=\"http:\/\/office.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sharepointdesigner\/default.aspx\">smart client for editing<\/a> WSS &amp; MOSS, but not viewing it. SP Explorer looks like it fills that gap nicely. <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sysknowlogy.com\/\">Shannon Braun<\/a> sent us all a link to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nealwhittengroup.com\/articles\/pmn10-99.asp\">the 50\/70 rule<\/a>, which seems like a good rule of thumb. Of course, assuming that things won&#8217;t progress linearly is almost always a good rule of thumb. But the 50\/70 rule has reasoning behind the assumption. <\/li>\n<li>Chicago is nice, but the weather has been a little freaky. It&#8217;s either been hot &amp; humid, downporing thunderstorms or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wandtv.com\/Global\/story.asp?S=6974859\">tornados<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kavp.com\/\">Keith Powell<\/a> showed me <a href=\"http:\/\/flightaware.com\/\">FlightAware<\/a>, which shows you flight departure and arrival history. My flight hasn&#8217;t left within an hour of scheduled departure in a week. I&#8217;m going to try and grab an earlier flight, but I have a feeling it&#8217;s going to be a long trip home.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>We spent all day yesterday discussing four topics: SaaS, Tools for Scrum, Web 2.0 and Domain Specific Languages.
