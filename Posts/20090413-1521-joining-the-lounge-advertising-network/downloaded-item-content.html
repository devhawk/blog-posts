<p>For those of you who read this blog primarily via my RSS feed, I made a change to my homepage over the weekend. Goodbye adSense, hello <a href="http://theloungenet.com/">The Lounge</a>. <a href="http://theloungenet.com">The Lounge</a> is an ad network run by <a href="http://infozerk.com/averyblog/">James Avery&#8217;s</a> company <a href="http://infozerk.com/">InfoZerk</a>. I&#8217;ve known James for a while &#8211; he included my now-obsolete <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/07/03/SccSwitch.aspx">SccSwitch tool</a> in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Studio-Hacks-Tools-Turbocharging/dp/0596008473/">Visual Studio Hacks</a>.</p>
<p>From a financial perspective, I&#8217;m not really sure how much of a difference this will make. I guess I&#8217;ll see when I get my first check. Given how little I was making with adSense, I&#8217;ve got nowhere to go but up. Regardless, I feel much better working with a smaller ad network run by someone I respect and that is focused on the .NET platform.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me in the Lounge ad network, James.</p>
