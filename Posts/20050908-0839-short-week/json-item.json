I&#8217;m not going to many sessions &#8211; I can get the content on the post conference DVD or simply by emailing the speaker or team directly. PDC is more about hanging out in the community lounge areas the connecting with the other attendees. (Well, that and presenting at the Architecture Symposium.)
