<li>As 24 sputters, <a href="http://abc.com/lost">Lost</a> hits it&#8217;s stride. Last nights episode rocked. </li>
<li>My old team keeps churning out great stuff. This time, it&#8217;s the new <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb190637.aspx">Composite Applications</a> site. </li>
<li>In a follow up to a post from a couple of weeks ago, Joe McKendrick declares that &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=816">Rogue IT is Cool</a>&#8220;. In the spirit of rogueness, maybe we get the <a href="http://www.rogue.com/">Rogue Ale guys</a> to whip up some IT themed beers? Service Oriented Stout? Architecture Ale? Programmer&#8217;s Porter? (you get the idea) </li>
<li>Scott Hanselman provides a <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/91074204/ExitingTheZoneOfPainStaticAnalysisWithNDepend.aspx">detailed look at static analysis</a> in general and NDepend in particular. I hereby coin the acronym YAGTSR, which stands for &#8220;Yet Another Great Tool Scott Recommends&#8221;.  </li>
<li>Jeff Atwood thinks we should <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000791.html">code smaller</a>. He lists some positive aspects of small code (less bugs, less chance of failure, etc) and links to <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2006/12/21/size-matters">Bob Koss</a> talking about the negative aspects of big code (harder to understand, harder to reuse, higher likelihood of duplication, etc). OK, I&#8217;m down, but where&#8217;s the how? I&#8217;ve got fairly radical ideas on this subject: <em>regularly throw out your old code and start over</em>. In movie making, there&#8217;s this idea that you have to &#8220;<a href="http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp03.Beachcombing.html">kill your babies</a>&#8220;. Not literally of course, they&#8217;re talking about having the willingness to scrap your pet idea, favorite line, coolest shot, etc. for the sake of the bigger picture. I think the same goes for making software.</li>
