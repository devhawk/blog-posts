-   As 24 sputters, [Lost](http://abc.com/lost) hits it’s stride. Last
    nights episode rocked.
-   My old team keeps churning out great stuff. This time, it’s the new
    [Composite
    Applications](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb190637.aspx)
    site.
-   In a follow up to a post from a couple of weeks ago, Joe McKendrick
    declares that “[Rogue IT is
    Cool](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=816)“. In the
    spirit of rogueness, maybe we get the [Rogue Ale
    guys](http://www.rogue.com/) to whip up some IT themed beers?
    Service Oriented Stout? Architecture Ale? Programmer’s Porter? (you
    get the idea)
-   Scott Hanselman provides a [detailed look at static
    analysis](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/91074204/ExitingTheZoneOfPainStaticAnalysisWithNDepend.aspx)
    in general and NDepend in particular. I hereby coin the acronym
    YAGTSR, which stands for “Yet Another Great Tool Scott Recommends”.
-   Jeff Atwood thinks we should [code
    smaller](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000791.html). He
    lists some positive aspects of small code (less bugs, less chance of
    failure, etc) and links to [Bob
    Koss](http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2006/12/21/size-matters)
    talking about the negative aspects of big code (harder to
    understand, harder to reuse, higher likelihood of duplication, etc).
    OK, I’m down, but where’s the how? I’ve got fairly radical ideas on
    this subject: *regularly throw out your old code and start over*. In
    movie making, there’s this idea that you have to “[kill your
    babies](http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp03.Beachcombing.html)“.
    Not literally of course, they’re talking about having the
    willingness to scrap your pet idea, favorite line, coolest shot,
    etc. for the sake of the bigger picture. I think the same goes for
    making software.
