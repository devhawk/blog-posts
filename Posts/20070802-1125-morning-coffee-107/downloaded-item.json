We also got a briefing in what&#8217;s coming for factories after VS08 (can&#8217;t blog about that). We ended with a look at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/dept\">DSL Editor Power Toy<\/a>, which provides additional views on a given model and allows you to completely replace the graphical editor with a Windows Forms UserControl. I wonder if you could <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ms745781.aspx\">use ElementHost<\/a> in order to build a WPF based editor? <\/li>\n<li>Finished the last Harry Potter book last night. My wife finished it last week but kept quiet about it until I got to the end. No spoilers here, but I wasn&#8217;t exactly surprised by how it played out. I wonder what J.K. Rowling will write next?  <\/li>\n<li>As promised, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/silverlight\/installation-win.aspx\">Silverlight 1.0 RC<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/silverlight\/installation-win-dev.aspx\">Silverlight 1.1 Alpha Refresh<\/a> were released last week. Also finishing out this beta wave were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyId=B52AEB39-1F10-49A6-85FC-A0A19CAC99AF&amp;displaylang=en\">Silverlight 1.1 Alpha Tools for VS08<\/a> and a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/expression\/products\/download.aspx?key=blend2preview\">new preview<\/a> of Expression Blend 2. Scott Hanselman <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/VS2008AndNET35Beta2ReleasesMadeEasy.aspx\">has all the details<\/a> on all the releases. <\/li>\n<li>In one of his articles on LINQ to SQL, Scott Guthrie <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2007\/06\/29\/linq-to-sql-part-3-querying-our-database.aspx\">mentioned<\/a> the LINQ to SQL debug visualizer in passing. Now, he <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2007\/07\/31\/linq-to-sql-debug-visualizer.aspx\">drills into that feature<\/a> in more detail. Apparently, this isn&#8217;t a built-in feature of VS08 &#8211; it has to be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scottgu.com\/blogposts\/linqquery\/SqlServerQueryVisualizer.zip\">installed separately<\/a>. Make sure you do that, this seems like a must-have extension for LINQ to SQL development. <\/li>\n<li>Jeff Atwood is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codinghorror.com\/blog\/archives\/000809.html\">worried<\/a> that he spends more time talking about programming than actually programming. That&#8217;s exactly why I left evangelism to join MSIT. <\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m still way behind on blogs, but if I don&#8217;t post this soon, it&#8217;s going to be an afternoon coffee. I&#8217;ve also got this day job thing that I&#8217;ve been away from for several days.
