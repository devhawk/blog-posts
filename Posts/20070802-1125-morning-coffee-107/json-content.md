-   The last day of the service factory workshop was much like [the
    second](http://devhawk.net/2007/08/01/Service+Factory+Customization+Workshop+Day+Two.aspx),
    primarily focusing on stuff p&p built to integrate GAT and DSLs. We
    also got a briefing in what’s coming for factories after VS08 (can’t
    blog about that). We ended with a look at the [DSL Editor Power
    Toy](http://www.codeplex.com/dept), which provides additional views
    on a given model and allows you to completely replace the graphical
    editor with a Windows Forms UserControl. I wonder if you could [use
    ElementHost](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms745781.aspx)
    in order to build a WPF based editor?
-   Finished the last Harry Potter book last night. My wife finished it
    last week but kept quiet about it until I got to the end. No
    spoilers here, but I wasn’t exactly surprised by how it played out.
    I wonder what J.K. Rowling will write next?
-   As promised, [Silverlight 1.0
    RC](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/installation-win.aspx) and
    [Silverlight 1.1 Alpha
    Refresh](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/installation-win-dev.aspx)
    were released last week. Also finishing out this beta wave were
    [Silverlight 1.1 Alpha Tools for
    VS08](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B52AEB39-1F10-49A6-85FC-A0A19CAC99AF&displaylang=en)
    and a [new
    preview](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/download.aspx?key=blend2preview)
    of Expression Blend 2. Scott Hanselman [has all the
    details](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VS2008AndNET35Beta2ReleasesMadeEasy.aspx)
    on all the releases.
-   In one of his articles on LINQ to SQL, Scott Guthrie
    [mentioned](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/06/29/linq-to-sql-part-3-querying-our-database.aspx)
    the LINQ to SQL debug visualizer in passing. Now, he [drills into
    that
    feature](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/31/linq-to-sql-debug-visualizer.aspx)
    in more detail. Apparently, this isn’t a built-in feature of VS08 –
    it has to be [installed
    separately](http://www.scottgu.com/blogposts/linqquery/SqlServerQueryVisualizer.zip).
    Make sure you do that, this seems like a must-have extension for
    LINQ to SQL development.
-   Jeff Atwood is
    [worried](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000809.html)
    that he spends more time talking about programming than actually
    programming. That’s exactly why I left evangelism to join MSIT.
-   I’m still way behind on blogs, but if I don’t post this soon, it’s
    going to be an afternoon coffee. I’ve also got this day job thing
    that I’ve been away from for several days. So more old news
    tomorrow.
