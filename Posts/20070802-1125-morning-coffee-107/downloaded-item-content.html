<li>The last day of the service factory workshop was much like <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/08/01/Service+Factory+Customization+Workshop+Day+Two.aspx">the second</a>, primarily focusing on stuff p&amp;p built to integrate GAT and DSLs. We also got a briefing in what&#8217;s coming for factories after VS08 (can&#8217;t blog about that). We ended with a look at the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/dept">DSL Editor Power Toy</a>, which provides additional views on a given model and allows you to completely replace the graphical editor with a Windows Forms UserControl. I wonder if you could <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms745781.aspx">use ElementHost</a> in order to build a WPF based editor? </li>
<li>Finished the last Harry Potter book last night. My wife finished it last week but kept quiet about it until I got to the end. No spoilers here, but I wasn&#8217;t exactly surprised by how it played out. I wonder what J.K. Rowling will write next?  </li>
<li>As promised, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/installation-win.aspx">Silverlight 1.0 RC</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/installation-win-dev.aspx">Silverlight 1.1 Alpha Refresh</a> were released last week. Also finishing out this beta wave were <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B52AEB39-1F10-49A6-85FC-A0A19CAC99AF&displaylang=en">Silverlight 1.1 Alpha Tools for VS08</a> and a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/download.aspx?key=blend2preview">new preview</a> of Expression Blend 2. Scott Hanselman <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VS2008AndNET35Beta2ReleasesMadeEasy.aspx">has all the details</a> on all the releases. </li>
<li>In one of his articles on LINQ to SQL, Scott Guthrie <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/06/29/linq-to-sql-part-3-querying-our-database.aspx">mentioned</a> the LINQ to SQL debug visualizer in passing. Now, he <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/31/linq-to-sql-debug-visualizer.aspx">drills into that feature</a> in more detail. Apparently, this isn&#8217;t a built-in feature of VS08 &#8211; it has to be <a href="http://www.scottgu.com/blogposts/linqquery/SqlServerQueryVisualizer.zip">installed separately</a>. Make sure you do that, this seems like a must-have extension for LINQ to SQL development. </li>
<li>Jeff Atwood is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000809.html">worried</a> that he spends more time talking about programming than actually programming. That&#8217;s exactly why I left evangelism to join MSIT. </li>
<li>I&#8217;m still way behind on blogs, but if I don&#8217;t post this soon, it&#8217;s going to be an afternoon coffee. I&#8217;ve also got this day job thing that I&#8217;ve been away from for several days. So more old news tomorrow.</li>
