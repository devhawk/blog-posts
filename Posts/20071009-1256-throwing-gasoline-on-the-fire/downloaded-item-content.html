<p>Steve Vinoski has raised a bit of a <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/http%3A%2F%2Fsteve.vinoski.net%2Fblog%2F2007%2F10%2F04%2Fthe-esb-question%2F" target="_blank">flame war</a> by admitting he has <a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2007/10/04/the-esb-question/" target="_blank">lost the ESB religion</a>. Given that I&#8217;ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/04/25/Enterprise+Service+Bus+Give+Me+An+Extra+Special+Bitter+Instead.aspx" target="_blank">never been a fan of ESB&#8217;s</a> anyway, there&#8217;s a lot there that I agree with. In particular I liked the description of &#8220;magical framework&#8221; middleware, blaming enterprise architects for driving ESB&#8217;s as the &#8220;single integration architecture&#8221; even though a single *anything* in the enterprise is untenable and his point that flexibility means you don&#8217;t do any one thing particularly well. </p>
<p>However, Steve goes on to bash compiled languages and WS-* while suggesting the One True Integration Strategy&#8482; is REST + &lt;insert your favorite dynamic language here&gt;, then <a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2007/10/06/the-degenerating-esb-discussion/" target="_blank">acts surprised</a> that the conversation denigrates into &#8220;us vs. them&#8221;. When you start by saying that compiled language proponents &#8220;natter on pointlessly&#8221;, I think you lose your right to later lament the depreciating level of conversation .</p>
<p>All programming languages provide their own unique model of the execution environment.&nbsp; Dynamic languages have a very different model than compiled languages. Arguing that this or that model is better for everyone, everywhere, in all circumstances seems unbelievably naive and arrogant at the same time. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I do agree with Steve&#8217;s point that most developers only know a single programming language, to their detriment. One language developers often miss a better solution because their language of choice doesn&#8217;t provide the right semantics to solve the problem at hand. Developers could do a lot worse than learn a new language. And I don&#8217;t mean a C# developer should learn VB. </p>
<p>The most pressing example of picking the right language for the right problem today is multi-threading. Most languages &#8211; including dynamic languages &#8211; have shitty concurrency semantics. If you&#8217;re building an app to take advantage of many-core processing, &#8220;mainstream&#8221; apps like C#, Java and Ruby won&#8217;t help you much. But we&#8217;re starting to see languages with native concurrency semantics like Erlang. Erlang is dynamically typed, but that&#8217;s not what makes it interesting. It&#8217;s interesting because of it&#8217;s native primitives for spawning tasks. I don&#8217;t see why you couldn&#8217;t add similar primitives for task spawning to a compiled functional language like <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx" target="_blank">F#</a>. </p>
<p>As for REST vs. SOAP/WS-*, I thought it was interesting that Steve provided no rationale whatsoever for why you should avoid them. The more I listen to this <strike>pissing match </strike>debate, the more I think the various proponents are arguing over unimportant syntactical details when the semantics are basically the same. SOAP is just a way to add metadata to an XML message, much as HTTP headers are. WS-* provides a set of <em><u>optional</u></em> message-level capabilities for handling cross-cutting concerns like security. Past that, are the models really that different? Nope. </p>
<p>For system integration scenarios like Steve is talking about, I&#8217;m not sure how important any of the WS-* capabilities are. Security? I can get that at the transport layer (aka HTTPS). Reliable Messaging? If I do request/response (which REST excels at), I don&#8217;t need RM. Transactions? Are you kidding me? Frankly, the only capability you <em>really</em> need in this scenario is idempotence, and neither REST or SOAP provides any standard mechanism to achieve that. (more on that in a later post)</p>
<p>I understand that some vendors are taking the WS-* specs and building out huge centralized infrastructure products and calling them ESBs. I think Steve is primarily raging against that, and on that point I agree 100%. But Steve sounds like he&#8217;s traded one religion for another &#8211; &#8220;Born Again REST&#8221;. For me, picking the right tool for the job implies much less fanaticism than Steve displays in his recent posts. </p>
