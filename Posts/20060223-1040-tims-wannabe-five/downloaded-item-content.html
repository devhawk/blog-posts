<p>I don&#8217;t know how I missed this before, but <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing">Tim Bray</a> blogged about <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/08/No-New-XML-Languages">not inventing XML languages</a> over a month ago. This comment is right on the money: &#8220;The value of a markup language is proportional approximately to the square of the number of different software implementations that can process it.&#8221; Conceptually, I agree with him &#8211; my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/16/Redundant+Specifications.aspx">primary argument against XSPF</a> is that it has the same basic semantics as RSS, but RSS is much more widely used. But his list of the &#8220;big five&#8221; markup lanugages seems more like the &#8220;wannabe five&#8221;. How many different siftware implementations process any of the things on his list? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not arguing the technical quality of these lanugages &#8211; frankly I&#8217;m not that familiar with any of them but Atom. But if you&#8217;re arguing the network effect, none of these formats Tim lists qualify. I&#8217;m sure he <em>wants</em> them to be popular, but wishing doesn&#8217;t make it so.</p>
