<p>In addition to being a history buff and architecture expert, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland">Pat</a> likes to sing - typically parody songs of his own creation. He's written many, but we actually broke down and got a license for <a href="http://www.don-mclean.com/">Don McLean's</a> classic "<a href="http://www.don-mclean.com/americanpie.asp">American Pie</a>". Pat performed his version - a speculative retrospective titled "Mr. CIO Guy" - at the end of his <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/europe/teched/">TechEd Europe</a> architecture track general session. You can watch a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=11950">streaming version</a> on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a>.
