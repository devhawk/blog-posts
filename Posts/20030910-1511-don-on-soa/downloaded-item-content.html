<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m the last blogger to watch <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/">Don&#8217;s</a><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20030827SOAPDB/manifest.xml"> MSDN TV</a><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20030902SOAPDB/manifest.xml"> episodes</a> on SOA. But if I&#8217;m not, go watch them right now. I especially like Don&#8217;s comments on XML Schema. They echo my own, but are much more coherent. Plus, it makes me glad I&#8217;ve never swapped out a CPU.</p>
