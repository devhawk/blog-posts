<p>I think I'm cursed - my HW woes continue. My multibay hard drive where I keep all my data as well as run my VPC's from has started to go belly up. So 22 GB of backing up later, I'm going to see if a complete reformat of the drive solves the problem. I'm thinking it's a controller issue, so reformatting isn't going to do squat, but I gotta see if I can salvage the drive. If not, a replacement multi-bay drive is not cheap. </p><p>In better news, I picked up <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/amped2/">Amped 2</a>, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/ghoulies/">Grabbed by the Ghoulies</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/crimsonskies/">Crimson Skies</a> @ the company store today. Crimson Skies is the one I wanted the most, but I liked the original Amped and I hear the sequel is pretty cool. I picked up Ghoulies primarily as a gift for the <a href="http://www.sacredheart.org/school/shshome.html">school</a> where my wife works as the director of <a href="http://www.sacredheart.org/school/Office/ESS/ESS.html">Extended School Services</a>. They have an XBOX but few games, so I figured I'd help out. I'm still waiting for <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/nhlrivals2004/">NHL Rivals 2004</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/pgr2/">Project Gotham Racing 2</a>. PGR2 was in the store briefly yesterday, but sold out almost immediately. Since I'm cursed, my XBOX is <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/hardware/discerror.htm">having occasional issues</a> as well, but nothing a little patience doesn't cure.</p>
