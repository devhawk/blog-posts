My multibay hard drive where I keep all my data as well as run my VPC&#8217;s from has started to go belly up. So 22 GB of backing up later, I&#8217;m going to see if a complete reformat of the drive solves the problem. I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s a controller issue, so reformatting isn&#8217;t going to do squat, but I gotta see if I can salvage the drive. If not, a replacement multi-bay drive is not cheap. <\/p>\n<p>In better news, I picked up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/amped2\/\">Amped 2<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/ghoulies\/\">Grabbed by the Ghoulies<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/crimsonskies\/\">Crimson Skies<\/a> @ the company store today. Crimson Skies is the one I wanted the most, but I liked the original Amped and I hear the sequel is pretty cool. I picked up Ghoulies primarily as a gift for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sacredheart.org\/school\/shshome.html\">school<\/a> where my wife works as the director of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sacredheart.org\/school\/Office\/ESS\/ESS.html\">Extended School Services<\/a>. They have an XBOX but few games, so I figured I&#8217;d help out. I&#8217;m still waiting for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/nhlrivals2004\/\">NHL Rivals 2004<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/pgr2\/\">Project Gotham Racing 2<\/a>. PGR2 was in the store briefly yesterday, but sold out almost immediately. Since I&#8217;m cursed, my XBOX is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/support\/hardware\/discerror.htm\">having occasional issues<\/a> as well, but nothing a little patience doesn&#8217;t cure.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I think I&#8217;m cursed &#8211; my HW woes continue.
