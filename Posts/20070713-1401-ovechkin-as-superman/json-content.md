Just [saw
this](http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2007/07/i-want-my-aotv.html) over
on Japers’ Rink and had to share. This video won a three 2007 Golden
Matrix award from the Information and Display and Entertainment
Association (IDEA): Best Music Video, Best Overall Video Display
(hockey) and Best Overall Video Display (overall). [More

on Kukla’s Korner. Congrats to the Caps PR team.

[Next
season](http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=TeamSchedule&team=WSH&season=20072008)
is only a little under three months away. Given the [moves the Caps have
made](http://tsn.ca/nhl/teams/news_story/?ID=213270&hubname=nhl-capitals)
this off season, next season should be a sight better than last season.
Playoffs? Maybe. Contending for playoffs? Probably? Cup Contenders?
Check back in a couple more years!
