<li>Quick update to the DevHawk 2007 World Tour: I won&#8217;t be making it to the <a href="http://www.mssoaandbpconference.com/" target="_blank">SOA &amp; BP Conference</a>. Riley&#8217;s having her tonsils out. As much as I&#8217;d like to hang with my geek peeps, family is the priority. But I can still make an evening event or geek dinner later in the week if anyone is game. </li>
<li>Caps season-opening winning streak <a href="http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20072008/GS020036.HTM" target="_blank">continues</a>. Still 100% on the PK, though the <a href="http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2007/10/early-power-outage-no-cause-for.html" target="_blank">power play is pretty anemic</a>. As I said yesterday, it&#8217;s WAAAAY to early in the season to start bragging, but starting strong is much better than starting weak.  </li>
<li>Speaking of hockey, looks like the <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117973647.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&nid=2562" target="_blank">NHL Network is launching</a> in the US this month (it&#8217;s been available in Canada since 2001). Also, <a href="http://www.nhl.tv/" target="_blank">NHL.tv</a> is up and running. Those wishing to see Caps highlights can go directly to <a href="http://Capitals.NHL.tv" target="_blank">Capitals.NHL.tv</a>. Unfortunately, if you want to see full games, you&#8217;ve got to subscribe to <a href="http://www.indemand.com/sports/nhl/" target="_blank">Center Ice</a> or <a href="http://www.nhl.com/nhlhq/centerice_online.html" target="_blank">Center Ice Online</a> to the tune of $150. But I don&#8217;t want to get &#8220;up to 40 games each week&#8221;, I just want the Caps games. Between the time zone difference and kids, it&#8217;s not like I have time to watch that much hockey anyway. Why can&#8217;t I subscribe to just the Caps games online for say $25 a season?  </li>
<li>Finished <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/halo3" target="_blank">Halo 3</a> Sunday night. Fun game and a great end of the trilogy. Looking forward to what the <a href="http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=news&cid=12835" target="_blank">newly-independent</a> Bungie does next. Something tells me we haven&#8217;t seen the last of Master Chief. However, I do think <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bioshock" target="_blank">Bioshock</a> has better and more original storytelling. <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect/" target="_blank">Mass Effect</a> looks like it&#8217;ll be better still.  </li>
<li>Sam Gentile <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/09/26/wcf-soa-tips-from-neudesic-dave-pallmann.aspx" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that his Neudesic colleague David Pallmann has posted a <a href="http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/?_c11_BlogPart_BlogPart=blogview&_c=BlogPart&partqs=cat%3dWCF" target="_blank">series of WCF tips</a>. Several of them are right on the money like &#8220;<a href="http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!257.entry" target="_blank">Take Advantage of One Way Operations</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!261.entry" target="_blank">Use a Discovery Mechanism to Locate Services</a>&#8220;. However, I can&#8217;t agree with &#8220;<a href="http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!257.entry" target="_blank">Maintain a Service Catalog</a>&#8220;. David warns that if you don&#8217;t, &#8220;The left hand won&#8217;t know what the right hand is doing.&#8221; Of course, that&#8217;s probably the case regardless of how you maintain your service catalog. And &#8220;<a href="http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!263.entry" target="_blank">Retry on minor failures</a>&#8220;? That&#8217;s fine, if you&#8217;ve got an <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/idempotent" target="_blank">idempotent</a> operation. Unfortunately, most non-read operations aren&#8217;t idempotent unless you take the time to design them that way. And most people don&#8217;t.  </li>
<li>Speaking of Sam, he&#8217;s <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/10/06/goodbye-codebetter-and-alt-net.aspx" target="_blank">blown up his CodeBetter blog</a> and <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/10/07/codebetter-and-alt-net-the-short-version.aspx" target="_blank">walked away from the ALT.NET crowd</a>. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/06/13/Morning+Coffee+89.aspx" target="_blank">not been a fan</a> of this ALT.NET stuff since it surfaced &#8211; as Sam said, &#8220;ALT.NET is a divisive thing&#8221; &#8211; so I&#8217;m happy to see my good friend walk away from it.  </li>
<li>Speaking of ALT.NET, Scott Hanselman blogged about <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottGuMVCPresentationAndScottHaScreencastFromALTNETConference.aspx" target="_blank">previewing the new ASP.NET MVC Framework</a> at the ALT.NET conference. Like Sam, Scott thinks the term ALT.NET is &#8220;too polarizing&#8221;. I like Scott&#8217;s suggestion for Pragmatic.NET. Oh, and the MVC framework stuff looks cool too.  </li>
<li>Reading <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/10/06/OAuth10IsHereDelegatedAuthorityComesToMashups.aspx" target="_blank">Dare&#8217;s description of OAuth</a> gave me a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-NET-My-Services-Specification/dp/073561556X" target="_blank">distinct sensation of deja-vu</a>.</li>
</ul>
