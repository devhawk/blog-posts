Riley&#8217;s having her tonsils out. As much as I&#8217;d like to hang with my geek peeps, family is the priority. But I can still make an evening event or geek dinner later in the week if anyone is game. <\/li>\n<li>Caps season-opening winning streak <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhl.com\/scores\/htmlreports\/20072008\/GS020036.HTM\" target=\"_blank\">continues<\/a>. Still 100% on the PK, though the <a href=\"http:\/\/japersrink.blogspot.com\/2007\/10\/early-power-outage-no-cause-for.html\" target=\"_blank\">power play is pretty anemic<\/a>. As I said yesterday, it&#8217;s WAAAAY to early in the season to start bragging, but starting strong is much better than starting weak.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of hockey, looks like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.variety.com\/article\/VR1117973647.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562\" target=\"_blank\">NHL Network is launching<\/a> in the US this month (it&#8217;s been available in Canada since 2001). Also, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhl.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\">NHL.tv<\/a> is up and running. Those wishing to see Caps highlights can go directly to <a href=\"http:\/\/Capitals.NHL.tv\" target=\"_blank\">Capitals.NHL.tv<\/a>. Unfortunately, if you want to see full games, you&#8217;ve got to subscribe to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.indemand.com\/sports\/nhl\/\" target=\"_blank\">Center Ice<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhl.com\/nhlhq\/centerice_online.html\" target=\"_blank\">Center Ice Online<\/a> to the tune of $150. But I don&#8217;t want to get &#8220;up to 40 games each week&#8221;, I just want the Caps games. Between the time zone difference and kids, it&#8217;s not like I have time to watch that much hockey anyway. Why can&#8217;t I subscribe to just the Caps games online for say $25 a season?  <\/li>\n<li>Finished <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/halo3\" target=\"_blank\">Halo 3<\/a> Sunday night. Fun game and a great end of the trilogy. Looking forward to what the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bungie.net\/News\/content.aspx?type=news&amp;cid=12835\" target=\"_blank\">newly-independent<\/a> Bungie does next. Something tells me we haven&#8217;t seen the last of Master Chief. However, I do think <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/bioshock\" target=\"_blank\">Bioshock<\/a> has better and more original storytelling. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/masseffect\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mass Effect<\/a> looks like it&#8217;ll be better still.  <\/li>\n<li>Sam Gentile <a href=\"http:\/\/samgentile.com\/blogs\/samgentile\/archive\/2007\/09\/26\/wcf-soa-tips-from-neudesic-dave-pallmann.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out<\/a> that his Neudesic colleague David Pallmann has posted a <a href=\"http:\/\/davidpallmann.spaces.live.com\/?_c11_BlogPart_BlogPart=blogview&amp;_c=BlogPart&amp;partqs=cat%3dWCF\" target=\"_blank\">series of WCF tips<\/a>. Several of them are right on the money like &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/davidpallmann.spaces.live.com\/blog\/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!257.entry\" target=\"_blank\">Take Advantage of One Way Operations<\/a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/davidpallmann.spaces.live.com\/blog\/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!261.entry\" target=\"_blank\">Use a Discovery Mechanism to Locate Services<\/a>&#8220;. However, I can&#8217;t agree with &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/davidpallmann.spaces.live.com\/blog\/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!257.entry\" target=\"_blank\">Maintain a Service Catalog<\/a>&#8220;. David warns that if you don&#8217;t, &#8220;The left hand won\u2019t know what the right hand is doing.&#8221; Of course, that&#8217;s probably the case regardless of how you maintain your service catalog. And &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/davidpallmann.spaces.live.com\/blog\/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!263.entry\" target=\"_blank\">Retry on minor failures<\/a>&#8220;? That&#8217;s fine, if you&#8217;ve got an <a href=\"http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/idempotent\" target=\"_blank\">idempotent<\/a> operation. Unfortunately, most non-read operations aren&#8217;t idempotent unless you take the time to design them that way. And most people don&#8217;t.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Sam, he&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/samgentile.com\/blogs\/samgentile\/archive\/2007\/10\/06\/goodbye-codebetter-and-alt-net.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">blown up his CodeBetter blog<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/samgentile.com\/blogs\/samgentile\/archive\/2007\/10\/07\/codebetter-and-alt-net-the-short-version.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">walked away from the ALT.NET crowd<\/a>. I&#8217;ve <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/06\/13\/Morning+Coffee+89.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">not been a fan<\/a> of this ALT.NET stuff since it surfaced &#8211; as Sam said, &#8220;ALT.NET is a divisive thing&#8221; &#8211; so I&#8217;m happy to see my good friend walk away from it.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of ALT.NET, Scott Hanselman blogged about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/ScottGuMVCPresentationAndScottHaScreencastFromALTNETConference.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">previewing the new ASP.NET MVC Framework<\/a> at the ALT.NET conference. Like Sam, Scott thinks the term ALT.NET is &#8220;too polarizing&#8221;. I like Scott&#8217;s suggestion for Pragmatic.NET. Oh, and the MVC framework stuff looks cool too.  <\/li>\n<li>Reading <a href=\"http:\/\/www.25hoursaday.com\/weblog\/2007\/10\/06\/OAuth10IsHereDelegatedAuthorityComesToMashups.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Dare&#8217;s description of OAuth<\/a> gave me a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Microsoft-NET-My-Services-Specification\/dp\/073561556X\" target=\"_blank\">distinct sensation of deja-vu<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Quick update to the DevHawk 2007 World Tour: I won&#8217;t be making it to the SOA &amp; BP Conference.
