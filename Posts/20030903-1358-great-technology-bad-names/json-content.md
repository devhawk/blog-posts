As someone who has spent most of the past three years explaining .NET to
customers, I’ve given up on the marketing department. I tell customers
point blank: “Microsoft is the company with the great technology and bad
names”.

MSN Direct and .NET aren’t even the worst cases of this:

-   Argue/flame if you like, but
    [MTS](http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/MTS.asp) was the first of
    the modern application servers. (The original version of EJB was
    essentially a clone of MTS.) But did we make a big deal about it?
    No, we shipped it as an “additional technology” included in the [NT
    4 Option
    Pack](http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/techresources/appserv/optionpack/ntopdg.asp).
    As if it was optional.
-   Windows 2000? Is that the new version of Windows 98?

-   MTS at least stood for something. What the heck does
    [COM+](http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/COMPlus.asp) stand for?
