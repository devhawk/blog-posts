-   Note, I somehow duplicated Morning Coffee 135. So I’ve skipped 136
    to make up for it.
-   Congrats to Hillary Clinton for her [unexpected
    win](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22570407/) in the New Hampshire
    primary. As I [said last
    week](http://devhawk.net/2008/01/04/Morning+Coffee+135.aspx), I
    think Obama has a better chance of winning in November, but I’ve got
    nothing against Clinton or her politics.
-   Speaking of winning, congrats to LSU on [winning the
    BCS](http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=280070194). Are they
    the best team in college football? Personally, I don’t think so –
    there are at least three other teams (Georgia, West VA and of course
    USC) who can make a persuasive argument that they should be \#1. But
    losing to teams like ~~Penn~~ Pitt and Stanford, neither WVA and USC
    have an argument they should have been in the championship game. But
    that’s what makes the BCS such BS. If nothing else, at least the “we
    need a playoff” meme is [picking up
    steam](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3186232).
-   This is sort of cool: [Eye-fi](http://www.eye.fi/) is a wireless
    enabled SD card so you can wirelessly upload pictures from your
    camera to your PC or favorite photo service. However, I think the
    price needs to come down a bit. I recently bought a 2GB SD card for
    my wife’s new camera for \$20. A 2GB Eye-fi card is
    [\$99](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000X27XDC). Not sure wireless
    upload is worth 5x per card.
-   With all the focus on LINQ providing type-safe queries, it’s easy to
    forget that some apps do need to build their queries at run time.
    Scott Guthrie points at a [Dynamic LINQ C\#
    sample](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/bb894665.aspx)
    (also [available for
    VB](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/bb964686.aspx)) that
    builds LINQ expression trees from strings. It kinda takes you back
    to the bad-old-days of embedding SQL strings in your code, but there
    are scenarios – especially BI scenarios – where you need this
    capability.

    [announces](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/01/08/visual-c-2008-feature-pack-beta.aspx)
    the [VC++ 2008 Feature Pack
    Beta](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D466226B-8DAB-445F-A7B4-448B326C48E7&displaylang=en).
    This is the long-awaited (by who?) MFC update as well as support for
    the [C++ TR1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Report_1). TR1
    provides some FP-esque support like [function
    objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Report_1#Function_Objects)
    and
    [tuples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Report_1#Tuple_Types),
    so maybe this is worth a look. On the other hand, given that much
    (all?) of TR1 is lifted from [Boost](http://www.boost.org/), maybe
    we should just use that.
-   Speaking of cool libraries, check out
    [C5](http://www.itu.dk/research/c5/) (aka the Copenhagen
    Comprehensive Collection Classes for C\#). It’s basically a complete
    redesign of System.Collections.Generic (or SCG as they call it).
    I’ve read thru their [online
    book](http://www.itu.dk/research/c5/Release1.0/ITU-TR-2006-76.pdf)
    and I’m very impressed. Of course, with me focused on F\# of late,
    I’m primarily using immutable collections, so I’m not sure how much
    use I have for C5 right now.
-   There was a free CoDe magazine in my DevTeach bag back in November
    with a [fascinating
    article](http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=990712182)
    on where LINQ goes from here – LINQ 2.0 if you will. One of things
    the article discusses is tier-splitting, which has seen the light of
    day in [Volta](http://labs.live.com/volta/). Will Volta also deliver
    External Relationships, Reshaping Combinators and Join Patterns or
    will those come from different projects?
-   I had to pave my workstation yesterday. I was running an interim
    build of Vista x64 SP1 and I couldn’t make Virtual Server work with
    it. As part of the repave, I discovered I needed to update the
    firmware of my SCSI controller, but the update had to run under DOS.
    Freaking DOS? My workstation doesn’t even have a floppy drive to
    boot DOS from! However, I was able to [boot from a USB thumb
    disk](http://www.bay-wolf.com/usbmemstick.htm) instead. That’s damn
    useful.
