So I&#8217;ve skipped 136 to make up for it. <\/li>\n<li>Congrats to Hillary Clinton for her <a href=\"http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/22570407\/\">unexpected win<\/a> in the New Hampshire primary. As I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/01\/04\/Morning+Coffee+135.aspx\">said last week<\/a>, I think Obama has a better chance of winning in November, but I&#8217;ve got nothing against Clinton or her politics. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of winning, congrats to LSU on <a href=\"http:\/\/scores.espn.go.com\/ncf\/recap?gameId=280070194\">winning the BCS<\/a>. Are they the best team in college football? Personally, I don&#8217;t think so &#8211; there are at least three other teams (Georgia, West VA and of course USC) who can make a persuasive argument that they should be #1. But losing to teams like <strike>Penn<\/strike> Pitt and Stanford, neither WVA and USC have an argument they should have been in the championship game. But that&#8217;s what makes the BCS such BS. If nothing else, at least the &#8220;we need a playoff&#8221; meme is <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/ncf\/news\/story?id=3186232\">picking up steam<\/a>. <\/li>\n<li>This is sort of cool: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eye.fi\/\">Eye-fi<\/a> is a wireless enabled SD card so you can wirelessly upload pictures from your camera to your PC or favorite photo service. However, I think the price needs to come down a bit. I recently bought a 2GB SD card for my wife&#8217;s new camera for $20. A 2GB Eye-fi card is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B000X27XDC\">$99<\/a>. Not sure wireless upload is worth 5x per card. <\/li>\n<li>With all the focus on LINQ providing type-safe queries, it&#8217;s easy to forget that some apps do need to build their queries at run time. Scott Guthrie points at a <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/vcsharp\/bb894665.aspx\">Dynamic LINQ C# sample<\/a> (also <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/vbasic\/bb964686.aspx\">available for VB<\/a>) that builds LINQ expression trees from strings. It kinda takes you back to the bad-old-days of embedding SQL strings in your code, but there are scenarios &#8211; especially BI scenarios &#8211; where you need this capability. <\/li>\n<li>Soma <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/somasegar\/archive\/2008\/01\/08\/visual-c-2008-feature-pack-beta.aspx\">announces<\/a> the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyId=D466226B-8DAB-445F-A7B4-448B326C48E7&amp;displaylang=en\">VC++ 2008 Feature Pack Beta<\/a>. This is the long-awaited (by who?) MFC update as well as support for the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technical_Report_1\">C++ TR1<\/a>. TR1 provides some FP-esque support like <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technical_Report_1#Function_Objects\">function objects<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technical_Report_1#Tuple_Types\">tuples<\/a>, so maybe this is worth a look. On the other hand, given that much (all?) of TR1 is lifted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boost.org\/\">Boost<\/a>, maybe we should just use that. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of cool libraries, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.itu.dk\/research\/c5\/\">C5<\/a> (aka the Copenhagen Comprehensive Collection Classes for C#). It&#8217;s basically a complete redesign of System.Collections.Generic (or SCG as they call it). I&#8217;ve read thru their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.itu.dk\/research\/c5\/Release1.0\/ITU-TR-2006-76.pdf\">online book<\/a> and I&#8217;m very impressed. Of course, with me focused on F# of late, I&#8217;m primarily using immutable collections, so I&#8217;m not sure how much use I have for C5 right now. <\/li>\n<li>There was a free CoDe magazine in my DevTeach bag back in November with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.code-magazine.com\/Article.aspx?quickid=990712182\">fascinating article<\/a> on where LINQ goes from here &#8211; LINQ 2.0 if you will. One of things the article discusses is tier-splitting, which has seen the light of day in <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.live.com\/volta\/\">Volta<\/a>. Will Volta also deliver External Relationships, Reshaping Combinators and Join Patterns or will those come from different projects? <\/li>\n<li>I had to pave my workstation yesterday. I was running an interim build of Vista x64 SP1 and I couldn&#8217;t make Virtual Server work with it. As part of the repave, I discovered I needed to update the firmware of my SCSI controller, but the update had to run under DOS. Freaking DOS? My workstation doesn&#8217;t even have a floppy drive to boot DOS from! However, I was able to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bay-wolf.com\/usbmemstick.htm\">boot from a USB thumb disk<\/a> instead. That&#8217;s damn useful. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Note, I somehow duplicated Morning Coffee 135. So I&#8217;ve skipped 136 to make up for it.
