  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Serendipity derives from commonality; the more our components agree upon before they meet, the more they can accomplish without requiring a software change.

You're right about Facebook and Flickr apps, but keep in mind that all it takes to create this problem is the slightest dependency of one component on anything specific to the implementation of the other.  In the cases of Facebook/Flickr, those dependencies are solely on data.  Had those APIs been WS-* APIs, the disagreement would have been far greater.

Look at it this way; one could consider Googlebot as a client of both Facebook and Flickr, but it has no dependency on any specific implementation detail of either.  It also handles other apps, including those yet to be developed, quite well too.]]></wp:comment_content>
