<p>For reasons to be named later, I'm experimenting with the various trust levels of ASP.NET. While "most things" work fine when you ratchet down the security, if finding that the things that break aren't well documented. For example, at anything other than Full Trust you can't use the Response.OutputStream.Write() method to write binary information to the response buffer. So that means that using <a href="http://devhawk.net/art_imagehandler.aspx">ASHX Handlers for images</a> doesn't work. That means that, among others, the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/vwd/starterkit/#personal">Personal Web Site starter kit</a> breaks on any photo related features.</p><p>Also, does anyone know what happened to <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/06251f13.aspx">permview</a> in .NET 2.0?</p>
