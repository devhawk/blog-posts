-   I’m surprised we haven’t seen a laptop with a flash memory hard
    drive yet. Given the significant power, heat and performance
    advantage of flash memory over hard drives, I would have expected
    the laptop companies to have high-end laptops with flash memory hard
    drives by now. I’m probably getting a new laptop in the next six
    months, but I’d hold out until the end of the year if it meant being
    able to get one with a flash memory hard drive.
-   I [wrote last
    month](http://devhawk.net/2007/01/10/Morning+Coffee+7.aspx) that
    “The next new language I learn will be
    [F\#](http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx)“. I was
    wrong. It’s
    [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx).
-   I’ve been listening to [Scott](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) gush
    about
    [CodeRush](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/CodeRush/)
    for years now. His [post
    yesterday](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FreeRefactorForASPNETSoftwareFromTheMakersOfCodeRush.aspx)
    about the new free version of Refactor! for ASP.NET finally kicked
    me into action. I installed the CodeRush trial and will be commence
    bugging my boss to buy it.
-   Looks like [big news brewing](http://www.identityblog.com/?p=668) in
    the online identity space.
-   Dale is [talking about service
    heartbeats](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!335.entry).
    I’m pretty stoked that Dale is now spending 100% of his work time
    (when he’s not blogging about sports, politics or video games
    anyway) with me building service oriented infrastructure for MSIT.
