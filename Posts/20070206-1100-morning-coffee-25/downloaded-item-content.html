<li>I&#8217;m surprised we haven&#8217;t seen a laptop with a flash memory hard drive yet. Given the significant power, heat and performance advantage of flash memory over hard drives, I would have expected the laptop companies to have high-end laptops with flash memory hard drives by now. I&#8217;m probably getting a new laptop in the next six months, but I&#8217;d hold out until the end of the year if it meant being able to get one with a flash memory hard drive.  </li>
<li>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/10/Morning+Coffee+7.aspx">wrote last month</a> that &#8220;The next new language I learn will be <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">F#</a>&#8220;. I was wrong. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">PowerShell</a>.  </li>
<li>I&#8217;ve been listening to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott</a> gush about <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/CodeRush/">CodeRush</a> for years now. His <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FreeRefactorForASPNETSoftwareFromTheMakersOfCodeRush.aspx">post yesterday</a> about the new free version of Refactor! for ASP.NET finally kicked me into action. I installed the CodeRush trial and will be commence bugging my boss to buy it.  </li>
<li>Looks like <a href="http://www.identityblog.com/?p=668">big news brewing</a> in the online identity space.  </li>
<li>Dale is <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!335.entry">talking about service heartbeats</a>. I&#8217;m pretty stoked that Dale is now spending 100% of his work time (when he&#8217;s not blogging about sports, politics or video games anyway) with me building service oriented infrastructure for MSIT. </li>
