Yesterday, [Pat](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland) did at
[keynote](http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2004/sf/keynotes.asp)
at [VSLive San
Fransicso](http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2004/sf/). He
talked about Metropolis (of course). Good to see architectural content
making it’s way into mainstream developer events. It even got picked up
by
[InfoWorld](http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/03/25/HNhelland_1.html).
I’m not sure how architect == “Microsoft exec”, but it’s great coverage
none the less.

Pat will be speaking at
[TechEd](http://www.microsoft.com/seminar/teched2004/default.mspx) in
May. In addition to his Metropolis overview, he has two session drilling
further into the parallels between applications and buildings as well as
between manufactured goods and structured data.

You can see a slightly older version of Pat’s Metropolis overview on
[Architecture
Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/enterprise/default.aspx).
Downloadable versions are coming soon.
