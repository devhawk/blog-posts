[Dave](http://knowbody.livejournal.com/) just posted [the
announcement](http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2008-September/008424.html)
to the IPy mailing list, Beta 5 has been released. You can [download the
release from
CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=15625).
Like Beta 4, this release is available in MSI or ZIP format, with the
MSI including the Python Standard Library as an option.

As per [the release
notes](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Wiki/View.aspx?title=v2.0%20Beta%205%20Release%20Notes&referringTitle=Home),
this is our last planned beta for 2.0 – our next planned release is RC1.
So if you’ve been holding off on upgrading to the latest betas or to 2.0
in general, now is the time to upgrade if you want us to fix your bug
before we ship 2.0.
