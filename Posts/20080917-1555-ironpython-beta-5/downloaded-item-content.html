<p><a href="http://knowbody.livejournal.com/">Dave</a> just posted <a href="http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2008-September/008424.html">the announcement</a> to the IPy mailing list, Beta 5 has been released. You can <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=15625">download the release from CodePlex</a>. Like Beta 4, this release is available in MSI or ZIP format, with the MSI including the Python Standard Library as an option.</p>
<p>As per <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Wiki/View.aspx?title=v2.0%20Beta%205%20Release%20Notes&referringTitle=Home">the release notes</a>, this is our last planned beta for 2.0 &#8211; our next planned release is RC1. So if you&#8217;ve been holding off on upgrading to the latest betas or to 2.0 in general, now is the time to upgrade if you want us to fix your bug before we ship 2.0.</p>
