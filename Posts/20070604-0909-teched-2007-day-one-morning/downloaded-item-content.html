<p>Being at TechEd without thousands of things to worry about is somewhat strange. But I could get used to coming and going as I please, not tracking down speakers, ordering whiteboards&nbsp;and the rest of the responsibility that comes with track ownership. </p>
<p>My first session is right after lunch &#8211; 1:15 @ Green TLC Theater 4 if you&#8217;re on site. Our Technical Learning Center (aka &#8220;the cabana&#8221;) is fairly sparsely attended, at least for the moment. MSIT has never had this significant a presence at TechEd before, so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the attendees aren&#8217;t quite sure what to make of it. I went over to the Architecture and SOA &amp; Web Services area and ran into quite a few people I knew. I expect I&#8217;ll spend more time down there than in my cabana. </p>
<p>I skipped the keynote this morning, apparently they did a <a href="http://clickanywhere.blogspot.com/2007/06/keynote-address.html">Back to the Future parody</a>. Had I known, I might have gotten up. But my flight got in at midnight last night, I didn&#8217;t get to the hotel until 1am and an 8:30 keynote on the east coast feels like a 5:30 keynote to my still jet-lagged system. Since I skipped it, I&#8217;m not sure what was announced, but the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/jun07/06-04TechED07PR.mspx">opening press release salvo</a>&nbsp;mentions the first CTP of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/prodinfo/futureversion/default.mspx">SQL Server 2008</a>, Visual Studio 2008 (aka the Visual Studio version formally known as &#8220;Orcas&#8221;) and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=AD0B72FB-4A1D-4C52-BDB5-7DD7E816D046&displaylang=en">Open XML SDK</a> among other things. I&#8217;ve been hacking some Open XML lately, so I&#8217;ll have to check that last thing out. Apparently, there was some also discussion of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/dsi">Dynamic Systems Initiative</a>, but in the press release it came across as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/io">Infrastructure Optimization</a>. Not sure if those are one in the same or not.</p>
<p>BTW, for those not attending TechEd, you can check out <a href="http://www.virtualteched.com">Virtual TechEd</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/events/teched/default.mspx">TechEd Virtual Pressroom</a>. Not the same as being here &#8211; no conversations, no swag and no roller coasters. But at least you can keep up on what&#8217;s being announced, presented and spoken about.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m off to lunch. Missing the keynotes == missing breakfast. My session is in about an hour, so I&#8217;ll probably post&nbsp;again afterwards. I&#8217;m hoping for more conversation and less presentation, so the only prep I&#8217;ve done is to iron my speaker shirt. </p>
