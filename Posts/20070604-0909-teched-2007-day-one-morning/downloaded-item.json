But I could get used to coming and going as I please, not tracking down speakers, ordering whiteboards\u00a0and the rest of the responsibility that comes with track ownership. <\/p>\n<p>My first session is right after lunch &#8211; 1:15 @ Green TLC Theater 4 if you&#8217;re on site. Our Technical Learning Center (aka &#8220;the cabana&#8221;) is fairly sparsely attended, at least for the moment. MSIT has never had this significant a presence at TechEd before, so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the attendees aren&#8217;t quite sure what to make of it. I went over to the Architecture and SOA &amp; Web Services area and ran into quite a few people I knew. I expect I&#8217;ll spend more time down there than in my cabana. <\/p>\n<p>I skipped the keynote this morning, apparently they did a <a href=\"http:\/\/clickanywhere.blogspot.com\/2007\/06\/keynote-address.html\">Back to the Future parody<\/a>. Had I known, I might have gotten up. But my flight got in at midnight last night, I didn&#8217;t get to the hotel until 1am and an 8:30 keynote on the east coast feels like a 5:30 keynote to my still jet-lagged system. Since I skipped it, I&#8217;m not sure what was announced, but the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/press\/2007\/jun07\/06-04TechED07PR.mspx\">opening press release salvo<\/a>\u00a0mentions the first CTP of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/sql\/prodinfo\/futureversion\/default.mspx\">SQL Server 2008<\/a>, Visual Studio 2008 (aka the Visual Studio version formally known as &#8220;Orcas&#8221;) and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyId=AD0B72FB-4A1D-4C52-BDB5-7DD7E816D046&amp;displaylang=en\">Open XML SDK<\/a> among other things. I&#8217;ve been hacking some Open XML lately, so I&#8217;ll have to check that last thing out. Apparently, there was some also discussion of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/dsi\">Dynamic Systems Initiative<\/a>, but in the press release it came across as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/io\">Infrastructure Optimization<\/a>. Not sure if those are one in the same or not.<\/p>\n<p>BTW, for those not attending TechEd, you can check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.virtualteched.com\">Virtual TechEd<\/a>\u00a0and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/events\/teched\/default.mspx\">TechEd Virtual Pressroom<\/a>. Not the same as being here &#8211; no conversations, no swag and no roller coasters. But at least you can keep up on what&#8217;s being announced, presented and spoken about.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m off to lunch. Missing the keynotes == missing breakfast. My session is in about an hour, so I&#8217;ll probably post\u00a0again afterwards. I&#8217;m hoping for more conversation and less presentation, so the only prep I&#8217;ve done is to iron my speaker shirt. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Being at TechEd without thousands of things to worry about is somewhat strange.
