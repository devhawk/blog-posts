<p>In addition to event activities, we also take advantage of SAF to have side meetings with customers. Yesterday, I spent an hour discussing software factories and high-performance computing with <a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~sjc/">Simon Cox</a> from the University of Southampton. Simon is one of our inaugural group of Architect <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;mvpaward&style=TOC#Visual Developer - Solutions Architect">MVPs</a>. We have fourteen architect MVPs across two categories: <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;mvpaward&style=TOC#Visual Developer - Solutions Architect">Visual Developer &#8211; Solutions Architect</a> and <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;mvpaward&style=TOC#Windows Server System - Infrastructure Architect">Windows Server System &#8211; Infrastructure Architect</a>. We&#8217;ll be growing this group significantly over the rest of the fiscal year, but there are already some influential names in this group, including <a href="http://www.objectwatch.com/about_us.htm">Roger Sessions</a>, Paul Preiss (founder of <a href="http://www.iasarchitects.org/">IASA</a>), <a href="http://www.thinktecture.com/staff/ingo/Weblog/">Ingo Rammer</a> and <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/">Clemens Vasters</a>. Congrats to all the new Architect MVPs!</p>
