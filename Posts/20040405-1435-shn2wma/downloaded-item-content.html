<p>I rewrote the script that <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=20ee0594-1157-4893-bb26-cfd95b26d58b">I blogged about</a> over the weekend to convert shorten files to WMA 9 lossless format. You&#8217;ve got to have the <a href="http://etree.org/shnutils/shorten/">shorten utility</a> on the path and have <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx">Windows Media 9 Encoder</a> installed. </p>
<p>Download the <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.office.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/BlogFiles/SHN2WMA.zip">SHN2WMA</a>&nbsp;script.</p>
<p>BTW, I claimed that the WMA lossless format was half the size of shorten&#8217;s format. Turns out that the ratio varies widely. For the concerts I&#8217;ve converted, I&#8217;ve seen as reduction percentage between WMA and shorten be as high as 55% and as low as 12%. </p>
