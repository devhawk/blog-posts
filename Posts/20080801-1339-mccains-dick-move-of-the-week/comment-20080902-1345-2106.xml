  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The problem with the Daily Show is that John Stewart makes good points, but can't resist behind such a smart ass little dick himself that it ruins whatever point he had. He's like the kid in school who would win arguments by repeating everything you said so that you lost your cool. You look stupid, but he hasn't actually said anything intelligent. Same with his critique of McCain. Sure, McCain was wrong with those spots, but Stewarts entire tirade against him was only made possible by cheap shots on out of context footage and a sycophantic audience of the kind of douchebag zealots who expect to find in Manhattan in the middle of the day without somewhere to be.
