[This
segment](http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=178207&title=dick-move-of-the-week-mccain)
on last night’s Daily Show was fantastic.

At the rate McCain’s going, Jon Stewart is going to have to change this
segment to “McCain’s Dick Move of the Day”. I don’t know which is more
embarrassing, McCain’s campaign or the mainstream media coverage of the
campaign.
