  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mac Office was in 18 about 4 years ago ;-), and it was 17 actually now that I think about. I'm sure that the mac posters were because the Mac Outlook team (part of Win Outlook) was in 18.

But anyway, 16, 17 and 18 were and have always been the Win Office buildings till now ;-).]]></wp:comment_content>
