David is specifically talking about blogging within the gaming division, but they apply pretty broadly to Microsoft as a whole when it comes to blogging. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get fired&#8221;, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do things that needlessly hurt my company&#8221; and &#8220;We can say things that PR or marketing people can&#8217;t.\u00a0 Or won&#8217;t.&#8221; all ring true to me.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of gaming, there seems to be more that your average cool games coming our for Xbox 360 this summer. I just picked up Forza 2 which rocks with the Racing Wheel. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/thedarkness\/\">The Darkness<\/a> looks very cool and I laughed my ass off playing the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/overlord\">Overlord<\/a> demo. Both shipped this week and have gotten <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/games\/xbox360\/\">good reviews<\/a>. On their way in August are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/bioshock\/\">Bioshock<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/bluedragonxbox360\/\">Blue Dragon<\/a>. Of course, there are a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/grandtheftautoiv\/\">few<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/assassinscreed\/\">other<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/halo3\">big<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/masseffect\/\">games<\/a> coming this holiday. A good, but expensive, year to be a gamer. <\/li>\n<li>I laughed my ass off reading Larry O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.knowing.net\/PermaLink,guid,0447726e-8ac1-46b2-8cf5-22afb7eb3cc5.aspx\">Top 10 Things To Do With Your Petaflop Supercomputer<\/a>, esp. #9. <\/li>\n<li>WSDL 2.0, it&#8217;s official. Nick Allen has the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/drnick\/archive\/2007\/06\/28\/wsdl-2-0-completed.aspx\">news<\/a>. Personally, WSDL seems to be the spec most responsible for driving RPC-style request\/response web services, so let&#8217;s just say that I am not a fan.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li>Joe McKendrick <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.zdnet.com\/service-oriented\/?p=905\">thinks<\/a><em>something <\/em>is &#8220;holding back SOA&#8221;? I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any one thing, but certainly the RPC style that most web service toolkits pretty much force down your throat isn&#8217;t helping.  <\/li>\n<li>Nick Malik <a href=\"http:\/\/udidahan.weblogs.us\/2007\/06\/27\/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions\/\">thinks<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/windowsclient.net\/acropolis\/\">Acropolis<\/a> is promising as a SOA service consumer, but Udi Dalan <a href=\"http:\/\/udidahan.weblogs.us\/2007\/06\/27\/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions\/http:\/\/udidahan.weblogs.us\/2007\/06\/27\/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions\/\">thinks<\/a> it doesn&#8217;t support multi-threading well enough. I lean towards Nick on this one since I see multi-threading as a language problem, which a library like Acropolis can&#8217;t solve on it&#8217;s own.  <\/li>\n<li>Jon Flanders <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masteringbiztalk.com\/blogs\/jon\/PermaLink,guid,01a499d4-9aa3-4902-bafd-fae03cb89d13.aspx\">has been busy<\/a> building the <a href=\"https:\/\/connect.microsoft.com\/site\/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=437\">BizTalk Server 2006 extensions for Windows Workflow Foundation (June CTP) SDK Sample<\/a>. I&#8217;m not sure why the marketing folks gave this such a long and involved name, but the sample does look pretty cool. Paul Andrews has the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/pandrew\/archive\/2007\/06\/04\/biztalk-adapter-for-windows-workflow-foundation-sample-june-2007-ctp.aspx\">project overview<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/?linkid=6902574\">demo video<\/a>. However, given that the WF workflows are hosted in BTS, is it accurate to say &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/pandrew\/archive\/2007\/06\/27\/no-biztalk-experience-required.aspx\">No Biztalk Experience Required<\/a>&#8220;? <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of WF, Tomas Restrepo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winterdom.com\/weblog\/2007\/06\/28\/WorkflowServicesInOrcas.aspx\">takes a detailed look<\/a> at the new WF service hosting in .NET FX 3.5. Mostly, he likes what he sees. I have the same problem he does with the message correlation IDs. I&#8217;d like to have other options here, including support for what I call &#8220;message data correlation&#8221; (Tomas describes this as &#8220;natural correlating identifiers&#8221;) and &#8220;address correlation&#8221; which is basically the REST model.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>My friend David &#8220;LetsKillDave&#8221; Weller writes a long post on corporate blogging, responding to comments on the subject from Penny Arcade.
