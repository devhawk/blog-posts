<li>My friend David &#8220;LetsKillDave&#8221; Weller <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LetsKillDave/~3/128471126/penny-arcade-s-jerry-quot-tycho-quot-holkins-gripes-about-microsoft-blogging-i-respond.aspx">writes a long post</a> on corporate blogging, responding to <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/06/27#1182927600">comments on the subject</a> from Penny Arcade. Andre &#8220;Ozymandias&#8221; Vrignaud <a href="http://ozymandias.com/archive/2007/06/27/Penny-Arcade-on-Microsoft-Bloggers.aspx">also responds</a>. David is specifically talking about blogging within the gaming division, but they apply pretty broadly to Microsoft as a whole when it comes to blogging. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get fired&#8221;, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do things that needlessly hurt my company&#8221; and &#8220;We can say things that PR or marketing people can&#8217;t.&nbsp; Or won&#8217;t.&#8221; all ring true to me.  </li>
<li>Speaking of gaming, there seems to be more that your average cool games coming our for Xbox 360 this summer. I just picked up Forza 2 which rocks with the Racing Wheel. <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/thedarkness/">The Darkness</a> looks very cool and I laughed my ass off playing the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/overlord">Overlord</a> demo. Both shipped this week and have gotten <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/xbox360/">good reviews</a>. On their way in August are <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bioshock/">Bioshock</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bluedragonxbox360/">Blue Dragon</a>. Of course, there are a <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/grandtheftautoiv/">few</a><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/assassinscreed/">other</a><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/halo3">big</a><a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect/">games</a> coming this holiday. A good, but expensive, year to be a gamer. </li>
<li>I laughed my ass off reading Larry O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,0447726e-8ac1-46b2-8cf5-22afb7eb3cc5.aspx">Top 10 Things To Do With Your Petaflop Supercomputer</a>, esp. #9. </li>
<li>WSDL 2.0, it&#8217;s official. Nick Allen has the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/06/28/wsdl-2-0-completed.aspx">news</a>. Personally, WSDL seems to be the spec most responsible for driving RPC-style request/response web services, so let&#8217;s just say that I am not a fan.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li>Joe McKendrick <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=905">thinks</a><em>something </em>is &#8220;holding back SOA&#8221;? I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any one thing, but certainly the RPC style that most web service toolkits pretty much force down your throat isn&#8217;t helping.  </li>
<li>Nick Malik <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/06/27/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions/">thinks</a><a href="http://windowsclient.net/acropolis/">Acropolis</a> is promising as a SOA service consumer, but Udi Dalan <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/06/27/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions/http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/06/27/cab-and-acropolis-of-little-help-for-soa-interactions/">thinks</a> it doesn&#8217;t support multi-threading well enough. I lean towards Nick on this one since I see multi-threading as a language problem, which a library like Acropolis can&#8217;t solve on it&#8217;s own.  </li>
<li>Jon Flanders <a href="http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon/PermaLink,guid,01a499d4-9aa3-4902-bafd-fae03cb89d13.aspx">has been busy</a> building the <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=437">BizTalk Server 2006 extensions for Windows Workflow Foundation (June CTP) SDK Sample</a>. I&#8217;m not sure why the marketing folks gave this such a long and involved name, but the sample does look pretty cool. Paul Andrews has the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2007/06/04/biztalk-adapter-for-windows-workflow-foundation-sample-june-2007-ctp.aspx">project overview</a> and <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=6902574">demo video</a>. However, given that the WF workflows are hosted in BTS, is it accurate to say &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2007/06/27/no-biztalk-experience-required.aspx">No Biztalk Experience Required</a>&#8220;? </li>
<li>Speaking of WF, Tomas Restrepo <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/06/28/WorkflowServicesInOrcas.aspx">takes a detailed look</a> at the new WF service hosting in .NET FX 3.5. Mostly, he likes what he sees. I have the same problem he does with the message correlation IDs. I&#8217;d like to have other options here, including support for what I call &#8220;message data correlation&#8221; (Tomas describes this as &#8220;natural correlating identifiers&#8221;) and &#8220;address correlation&#8221; which is basically the REST model.</li>
