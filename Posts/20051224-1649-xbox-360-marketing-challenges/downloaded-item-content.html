<p>While my blog was down, Microsoft launched the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/xbox360/">Xbox 360</a> with significant fanfare and dramatic demand. Of course, a month later the Xbox 360 is still <a href="http://bensbargains.net/xbox360/xbox360.php">sold out</a> pretty much <span class="SpellE">every where</span> you go. I remember I got able to find an original Xbox before Christmas back in 2001 so either the demand is much higher or the supply is much <span class="GramE">lower</span> (probably both). I&#8217;ve personally decided to wait on getting a 360 &#8211; I&#8217;m way behind on original Xbox games and my&nbsp;<a href="http://storage.msn.com/x1pFeqfYuS6GVACJn9mvD1nrS9Ut2YqkWWLeyDj-jjA1Vlz-sbk7qMMCGGYMaLCUAbJtUaD0FbymyD_HYC7NdAPWETpzHTA7PzW9zlvfjQYbDGu0c2PO2PpW8hz2FarO0oH">two kids</a> don&#8217;t leave much playtime anyway. But I&#8217;m certainly in the minority on this one.</p>
<p>Anyway, at the height of the frenzy a couple days after launch, <a href="http://www.johnporcaro.com/">John Porcaro</a> wrote what I thought was <a href="http://www.johnporcaro.com/2005/11/index.html">an amazing post</a> about the difficulties of marketing a product like Xbox 360. I mean, we&#8217;re all acutely aware of the technical challenges of designing a hardware product like Xbox 360 or a software service like Xbox Live. Maybe that time in marketing rotted my brain, but the challenge John describes is significant. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I think John really lays it out there in his post. It may not have been good news (i.e. Xbox 360 shortages for the near-term future) but it was open and forthright about where Microsoft is with the Xbox 360 and how Microsoft wants Xbox to grow.</p>
<p>(Note: AFAIK, I am not getting a free Xbox 360 from John for writing this.)</p>
