Of course, a month later the Xbox 360 is still <a href=\"http:\/\/bensbargains.net\/xbox360\/xbox360.php\">sold out<\/a> pretty much <span class=\"SpellE\">every where<\/span> you go. I remember I got able to find an original Xbox before Christmas back in 2001 so either the demand is much higher or the supply is much <span class=\"GramE\">lower<\/span> (probably both). I&#8217;ve personally decided to wait on getting a 360 &#8211; I&#8217;m way behind on original Xbox games and my\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/storage.msn.com\/x1pFeqfYuS6GVACJn9mvD1nrS9Ut2YqkWWLeyDj-jjA1Vlz-sbk7qMMCGGYMaLCUAbJtUaD0FbymyD_HYC7NdAPWETpzHTA7PzW9zlvfjQYbDGu0c2PO2PpW8hz2FarO0oH\">two kids<\/a> don&#8217;t leave much playtime anyway.

I mean, we&#8217;re all acutely aware of the technical challenges of designing a hardware product like Xbox 360 or a software service like Xbox Live. Maybe that time in marketing rotted my brain, but the challenge John describes is significant. <\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, I think John really lays it out there in his post. It may not have been good news (i.e. Xbox 360 shortages for the near-term future) but it was open and forthright about where Microsoft is with the Xbox 360 and how Microsoft wants Xbox to grow.<\/p>\n<p>(Note: AFAIK, I am not getting a free Xbox 360 from John for writing this.)<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>While my blog was down, Microsoft launched the Xbox 360 with significant fanfare and dramatic demand.
