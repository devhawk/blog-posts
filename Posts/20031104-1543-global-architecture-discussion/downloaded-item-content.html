<p>I don&#8217;t want to turn this blog into &#8220;What weird books did .NEAT use to as window dressing @ the SAF&#8221; but I can&#8217;t resist this one: &#8220;<a href="http://www.allbookstores.com/book/0553061011">Los Negocios en la Era Digital</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/default.asp">Bill Gates</a>. It&#8217;s a Spanish translation of &#8220;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speedofthought/">Business @ the Speed of Thought</a>&#8221; though the literal translation of the Spanish title is &#8220;Businesses in the Digital Era&#8221;. </p>
<p>Speaking of Portuguese (I know, I wasn&#8217;t speaking of Portuguese, but it&#8217;s closely related to Spanish), check out Jose Silva&#8217;s <a href="http://canoas.com/blog/">blog</a> (if you don&#8217;t speak Portuguese, check out the AltaVista Babelfish <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr?doit=done&urltext=http://canoas.com/blog/&lp=pt_en"> translation</a>). Jose is an architect evangelist for Microsoft from Portugal.
