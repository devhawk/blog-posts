<p>I don't want to turn this blog into "What weird books did .NEAT use to as window dressing @ the SAF" but I can't resist this one: "<a href="http://www.allbookstores.com/book/0553061011">Los Negocios en la Era Digital</a>" by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/default.asp">Bill Gates</a>. It's a Spanish translation of "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speedofthought/">Business @ the Speed of Thought</a>" though the literal translation of the Spanish title is "Businesses in the Digital Era". </p><p>Speaking of Portuguese (I know, I wasn't speaking of Portuguese, but it's closely related to Spanish), check out Jose Silva's <a href="http://canoas.com/blog/">blog</a> (if you don't speak Portuguese, check out the AltaVista Babelfish <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr?doit=done&amp;urltext=http://canoas.com/blog/&amp;lp=pt_en"> translation</a>). Jose is an architect evangelist for Microsoft from Portugal. His <a href="http://canoas.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6c7b77f6-2a11-47ae-ae42-7d5e8e86d312"> most recent entry</a> was on Keith Short's PDC Architecture Symposium Session. RSS-Subscribed.</p>
