Today is my father’s birthday. Yes, I realize [mine was
Monday](http://devhawk.net/2007/05/21/Im+37.aspx). To make it even
weirder, my brother Ted’s birthday was yesterday. Let’s just say this
week was hard on my mother when Ted and I were kids.

Happy Birthday Dad! He’s on the road today, so he won’t see it until
after his birthday is officially over, but it’s the thought that counts,
right?
