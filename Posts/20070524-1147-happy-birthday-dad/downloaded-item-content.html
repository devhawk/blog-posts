<p>Today is my father&#8217;s birthday. Yes, I realize <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/21/Im+37.aspx">mine was Monday</a>. To make it even weirder, my brother Ted&#8217;s birthday was yesterday. Let&#8217;s just say this week was hard on my mother when Ted and I were kids. </p>
<p>Happy Birthday Dad! He&#8217;s on the road today, so he won&#8217;t see it until after his birthday is officially over, but it&#8217;s the thought that counts, right?</p>
