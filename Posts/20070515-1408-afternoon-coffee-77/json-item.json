His first post back is basically &#8220;what I&#8217;ve been up to for the past two years&#8221;, which is to say no cool tech stuff&#8230;yet. David Ing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.from9till2.com\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c2b59304-0681-4bda-8697-03f993d8c0f6\">calls Pat&#8217;s time @ Amazon<\/a> &#8220;an extended training sabbatical&#8221; and that we&#8217;re lucky to have him back. Agree 100%.

Don Box <a href=\"http:\/\/pluralsight.com\/blogs\/dbox\/archive\/2007\/05\/10\/47285.aspx\">calls him<\/a> the &#8220;brightest guy in XML-land&#8221;. <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.jclark.com\/2007\/04\/do-we-need-new-kind-of-schema-language.html\">Money Quote<\/a>: &#8220;any damn fool could produce a better data format than XML.&#8221;  <\/li>\n<li>Rick Barnes &#8211; aka my boss &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/rickbarn.spaces.live.com\/Blog\/cns!F8796F31B57620E9!242.entry\">likes<\/a> Roger Session&#8217;s white paper <a href=\"http:\/\/www.objectwatch.com\/whitepapers\/ABetterPath-Final.pdf\">A Better Path to Enterprise Architectures<\/a>\u00a0and comes up with a number of variants of Roger&#8217;s Observe\/Orient\/Plan\/Act model. Then he asks the $64,000 question: &#8220;Why then, do we insist on spending months analyzing software the business, interviewing subject matter experts and end users, writing hundred or thousand page &#8220;requirements&#8221; documents, and meeting to agree on dozens or hundreds of features before we write the first line of code?&#8221; Rick is one of the reasons I took this job instead of the other awesome opportunities I had when I was switching jobs. I&#8217;m sure you see why.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of requirements, Eric Sink has a <a href=\"http:\/\/software.ericsink.com\/articles\/Requirements.html\">phenomenal post<\/a> on requirements. Go read it. Can we officially grant &#8220;Walking Spec&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/c2.com\/cgi\/wiki?AntiPattern\">anti-pattern<\/a> status without\u00a0the customary waiting period?  <\/li>\n<li>Scott Guthrie posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2007\/05\/15\/new-orcas-language-feature-anonymous-types.aspx\">Anonymous Types<\/a>, the latest in his series on the new language features coming with LINQ. Anon types in and of themselves are a fairly simple construct &#8211; you pass the properties and values into the new <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2007\/03\/08\/new-c-orcas-language-features-automatic-properties-object-initializers-and-collection-initializers.aspx\">object init syntax<\/a> and the compiler munges up a class to match. Simple, but critical for SQL-style data shaping queries. Of course, the limitation is that you can&#8217;t pass the anonymous type object around in any type-safe way.  <\/li>\n<li>LINQ to * Watch: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/LINQtoSharePoint\">LINQ to SharePoint<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/community.bartdesmet.net\/blogs\/bart\/archive\/2007\/05\/10\/about-katmai-astoria-jasper-acropolis-pex-and-an-update-on-linq-to-sharepoint.aspx\">Details<\/a> on Bart de Smet&#8217;s blog.  <\/li>\n<li>Jeff Atwood writes a long post to ask for background compilation in C#. +1 on that request. But I disagree with his point about &#8220;giving up on the idea that .NET is a multiple language runtime&#8221;. Even though the runtime supports multiple languages, most programmers are only fluent in one.  <\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m a bit behind on this, but my old team has moved <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skyscrapr.net\/\">SkyScrapr<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/skyscrapr\/\">MSDN<\/a>. For the uninitiated, SkyScrapr is a site for aspiring architects to learn about software architects and architecture.  <\/li>\n<li><strike>p&amp;p<\/strike><a href=\"http:\/\/www.clariusconsulting.net\">Clarius<\/a> has shipped a new software factory: the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/vsipfactory\">VSIPFactory<\/a>, a software factory for Visual Studio Extensibility. Pablo Galiano <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clariusconsulting.net\/blogs\/pga\/archive\/2007\/04\/03\/23974.aspx\">has more<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Update: I mistakenly attributed the VSIPFactory to p&amp;p.
