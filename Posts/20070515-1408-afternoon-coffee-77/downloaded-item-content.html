<li>Pat Helland is finally <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/05/14/i-m-glad-to-be-back.aspx">blogging again</a>. His first post back is basically &#8220;what I&#8217;ve been up to for the past two years&#8221;, which is to say no cool tech stuff&#8230;yet. David Ing <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c2b59304-0681-4bda-8697-03f993d8c0f6">calls Pat&#8217;s time @ Amazon</a> &#8220;an extended training sabbatical&#8221; and that we&#8217;re lucky to have him back. Agree 100%. BTW, since Pat didn&#8217;t include a link to his recent <a href="http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2007/papers/cidr07p15.pdf">paper</a> and <a href="http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2007/slides/p15-helland.ppt">presentation</a>,&nbsp;I will.  </li>
<li>Speaking of blogging luminaries, James Clark is also <a href="http://blog.jclark.com/">blogging</a>. Don Box <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2007/05/10/47285.aspx">calls him</a> the &#8220;brightest guy in XML-land&#8221;. <a href="http://blog.jclark.com/2007/04/do-we-need-new-kind-of-schema-language.html">Money Quote</a>: &#8220;any damn fool could produce a better data format than XML.&#8221;  </li>
<li>Rick Barnes &#8211; aka my boss &#8211; <a href="http://rickbarn.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!F8796F31B57620E9!242.entry">likes</a> Roger Session&#8217;s white paper <a href="http://www.objectwatch.com/whitepapers/ABetterPath-Final.pdf">A Better Path to Enterprise Architectures</a>&nbsp;and comes up with a number of variants of Roger&#8217;s Observe/Orient/Plan/Act model. Then he asks the $64,000 question: &#8220;Why then, do we insist on spending months analyzing software the business, interviewing subject matter experts and end users, writing hundred or thousand page &#8220;requirements&#8221; documents, and meeting to agree on dozens or hundreds of features before we write the first line of code?&#8221; Rick is one of the reasons I took this job instead of the other awesome opportunities I had when I was switching jobs. I&#8217;m sure you see why.  </li>
<li>Speaking of requirements, Eric Sink has a <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/articles/Requirements.html">phenomenal post</a> on requirements. Go read it. Can we officially grant &#8220;Walking Spec&#8221; <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AntiPattern">anti-pattern</a> status without&nbsp;the customary waiting period?  </li>
<li>Scott Guthrie posted on <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/15/new-orcas-language-feature-anonymous-types.aspx">Anonymous Types</a>, the latest in his series on the new language features coming with LINQ. Anon types in and of themselves are a fairly simple construct &#8211; you pass the properties and values into the new <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/03/08/new-c-orcas-language-features-automatic-properties-object-initializers-and-collection-initializers.aspx">object init syntax</a> and the compiler munges up a class to match. Simple, but critical for SQL-style data shaping queries. Of course, the limitation is that you can&#8217;t pass the anonymous type object around in any type-safe way.  </li>
<li>LINQ to * Watch: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/LINQtoSharePoint">LINQ to SharePoint</a>. <a href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2007/05/10/about-katmai-astoria-jasper-acropolis-pex-and-an-update-on-linq-to-sharepoint.aspx">Details</a> on Bart de Smet&#8217;s blog.  </li>
<li>Jeff Atwood writes a long post to ask for background compilation in C#. +1 on that request. But I disagree with his point about &#8220;giving up on the idea that .NET is a multiple language runtime&#8221;. Even though the runtime supports multiple languages, most programmers are only fluent in one.  </li>
<li>I&#8217;m a bit behind on this, but my old team has moved <a href="http://www.skyscrapr.net/">SkyScrapr</a> to <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/skyscrapr/">MSDN</a>. For the uninitiated, SkyScrapr is a site for aspiring architects to learn about software architects and architecture.  </li>
<li><strike>p&amp;p</strike><a href="http://www.clariusconsulting.net">Clarius</a> has shipped a new software factory: the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/vsipfactory">VSIPFactory</a>, a software factory for Visual Studio Extensibility. Pablo Galiano <a href="http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/pga/archive/2007/04/03/23974.aspx">has more</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Update: I mistakenly attributed the VSIPFactory to p&amp;p. It&#8217;s from Clarius. Sorry guys.</p>
