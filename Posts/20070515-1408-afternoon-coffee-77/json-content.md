-   Pat Helland is finally [blogging
    again](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/05/14/i-m-glad-to-be-back.aspx).
    His first post back is basically “what I’ve been up to for the past
    two years”, which is to say no cool tech stuff…yet. David Ing [calls
    Pat’s time @
    Amazon](http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c2b59304-0681-4bda-8697-03f993d8c0f6)
    “an extended training sabbatical” and that we’re lucky to have him
    back. Agree 100%. BTW, since Pat didn’t include a link to his recent
    [paper](http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2007/papers/cidr07p15.pdf)
    and
    [presentation](http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2007/slides/p15-helland.ppt), I
    will.
-   Speaking of blogging luminaries, James Clark is also
    [blogging](http://blog.jclark.com/). Don Box [calls
    him](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2007/05/10/47285.aspx)
    the “brightest guy in XML-land”. [Money
    Quote](http://blog.jclark.com/2007/04/do-we-need-new-kind-of-schema-language.html):
    “any damn fool could produce a better data format than XML.”
-   Rick Barnes – aka my boss –
    [likes](http://rickbarn.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!F8796F31B57620E9!242.entry)
    Roger Session’s white paper [A Better Path to Enterprise
    Architectures](http://www.objectwatch.com/whitepapers/ABetterPath-Final.pdf) and
    comes up with a number of variants of Roger’s
    Observe/Orient/Plan/Act model. Then he asks the \$64,000 question:
    “Why then, do we insist on spending months analyzing software the
    business, interviewing subject matter experts and end users, writing
    hundred or thousand page “requirements” documents, and meeting to
    agree on dozens or hundreds of features before we write the first
    line of code?” Rick is one of the reasons I took this job instead of
    the other awesome opportunities I had when I was switching jobs. I’m
    sure you see why.
-   Speaking of requirements, Eric Sink has a [phenomenal
    post](http://software.ericsink.com/articles/Requirements.html) on
    requirements. Go read it. Can we officially grant “Walking Spec”
    [anti-pattern](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AntiPattern) status
    without the customary waiting period?
-   Scott Guthrie posted on [Anonymous
    Types](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/15/new-orcas-language-feature-anonymous-types.aspx),
    the latest in his series on the new language features coming with
    LINQ. Anon types in and of themselves are a fairly simple construct
    – you pass the properties and values into the new [object init
    syntax](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/03/08/new-c-orcas-language-features-automatic-properties-object-initializers-and-collection-initializers.aspx)
    and the compiler munges up a class to match. Simple, but critical
    for SQL-style data shaping queries. Of course, the limitation is
    that you can’t pass the anonymous type object around in any
    type-safe way.

    SharePoint](http://www.codeplex.com/LINQtoSharePoint).

    on Bart de Smet’s blog.
-   Jeff Atwood writes a long post to ask for background compilation in
    C\#. +1 on that request. But I disagree with his point about “giving
    up on the idea that .NET is a multiple language runtime”. Even
    though the runtime supports multiple languages, most programmers are
    only fluent in one.
-   I’m a bit behind on this, but my old team has moved
    [SkyScrapr](http://www.skyscrapr.net/) to
    [MSDN](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/skyscrapr/). For the uninitiated,
    SkyScrapr is a site for aspiring architects to learn about software
    architects and architecture.
-   ~~p&p~~[Clarius](http://www.clariusconsulting.net) has shipped a new
    software factory: the
    [VSIPFactory](http://www.codeplex.com/vsipfactory), a software
    factory for Visual Studio Extensibility. Pablo Galiano [has
    more](http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/pga/archive/2007/04/03/23974.aspx).

**Update**: I mistakenly attributed the VSIPFactory to p&p. It’s from
Clarius. Sorry guys.
