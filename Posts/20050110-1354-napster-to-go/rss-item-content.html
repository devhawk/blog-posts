<p>Apparently Napster to Go is old news, having been launched in beta months ago. They don't appear to be marketing it - the only mention of it I could find was on the page of <a href="http://www.napster.com/compatible_devices/">compatible devices</a>. I'm guessing the reason is the page only lists five devices compatible with the Napster to Go service and all of them are portable media centers. I wanted to search for other devices compatible with <!--StartFragment -->Windows Media Digital Rights Management 10 but the PlaysForSure advance search isn't working. There's new firmware for the <a href="http://www.nomadworld.com/downloads/firmware/wma-getfw.asp?nProdID=556&amp;sProd=Creative%20Zen%20Micro">Zen Micro</a> that supports WMDRM 10, but nothing yet for the Zen Xtra. On the plus side, I discovered the <a href="http://developer.creative.com/articles/article.asp?cat=3&amp;sbcat=38&amp;top=53&amp;aid=71">Nomad SDK</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/friendlynomad">FriendlyNomad</a> C# wrapper for the SDK. Not sure what I would write that accessed my Nomad - I which I could customize the playback experience but Red Chair Software's <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/">Notmad Explorer</a> provides a great PC expereince.</p>
