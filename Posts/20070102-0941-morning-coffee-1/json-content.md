I’m trying to write more in 2007. Here’s a roundup of stuff rattling
around my brain:

-   [Fight On](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=270010130)! So
    much for Michigan and their bleating about being left out of the
    championship game. Also, massive congrats to [Boise
    State](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=270010201).
-   Santa did [bring me free
    time](http://devhawk.net/2006/12/13/Good+Week+For+Hobbyists+And+Students.aspx)
    this holiday, but I spent it playing games rather than writing them.
    I’m digging [Gears](http://www.xbox.com/games/gearsofwar) (big
    surprise) and [Dead Rising](http://xbox.com/games/deadrising), and
    I’ve starting playing [Viva
    Pinata](http://xbox.com/games/vivapinata) with Patrick. Plus, I
    finished
    [GRAW](http://www.xbox.com/games/tomclancysghostreconadvancedwarfighterxbox360)
    which I had on loan from a friend just in time to start playing
    [Vegas](http://xbox.com/games/tomclancyrainbowsixvegas/). Note I
    said “free time” which is to say time when I wasn’t hanging out with
    my family. Typically during naps or after everyone was in bed,
    though I did skip at least one birthday party to play instead.
-   We had a “surprise” snow storm two days after Christmas. Not enough
    to be dangerous driving, but enough to make a snowman with my kids.
    It’s still there, though now that it’s 55 degrees, I’m guessing it
    will be totally melted by the time I get home from work. It’s been
    melting a little bit each day, so it’s been like watching the climax
    of Raiders of the Lost Ark in slow motion.
-   My wife and I finished watching season 5 of Alias last night. Fun,
    though it had really jumped the shark by Season 5. We watched the
    entire series on DVD, which really makes me wonder about the future
    of broadcast TV. We watched season 1 of Lost on DVD but we’ve been
    watching on TV ever since. I’m hooked on Lost, so there’s no way I
    could go back to DVDs at this point, but I’m thinking that DVD is a
    better way to go for most TV. I wonder how this will change TV
    storytelling.
-   I wish I could see how a show like Lost or Alias evolves over time.
    How much of the Rimbaldi story arc was mapped out before the show
    started? How did the production team deal with forced changes like
    Jennifer Garner’s pregnancy or the apparently surprise series
    cancellation?
-   I had 12 days off for the holidays, so it’s very tough to be back at
    work. As I suggested above, I did very little coding while I was
    off, so getting back in the saddle won’t be easy. It’s especially
    hard on my little boy that I’m back to work. He was acting up
    yesterday which is fairly unusual. I finally asked him if he was sad
    about me going back to work and he broke down crying. I’m very lucky
    to be a part of such a tight knit family.
-   I’ve been in my [“new”
    job](http://devhawk.net/2006/06/15/Moving+On.aspx) for six months,
    but it seems like longer. I mean that in a good way. It feels like I
    fit better in this job, on a much smaller team, actually building
    stuff instead of just “evangelizing” it. Nothing against evangelism,
    I just think I burned out on that job.

So starts a new feature on DevHawk. As you might guess from the “1″ in
the title, I’m hoping to make this a regular feature. As I ease back
into work, expect more tech related nuggets along with the more random
stuff. I should admit, however, that I actually don’t drink coffee.
:smile:
