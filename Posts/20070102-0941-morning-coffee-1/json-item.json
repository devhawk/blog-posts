Here&#8217;s a roundup of stuff rattling around my brain:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/ncf\/recap?gameId=270010130\">Fight On<\/a>! So much for Michigan and their bleating about being left out of the championship game. Also, massive congrats to <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/ncf\/recap?gameId=270010201\">Boise State<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>Santa did <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/12\/13\/Good+Week+For+Hobbyists+And+Students.aspx\">bring me free time<\/a> this holiday, but I spent it playing games rather than writing them. I&#8217;m digging <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/gearsofwar\">Gears<\/a> (big surprise) and <a href=\"http:\/\/xbox.com\/games\/deadrising\">Dead Rising<\/a>, and I&#8217;ve starting playing <a href=\"http:\/\/xbox.com\/games\/vivapinata\">Viva Pinata<\/a> with Patrick. Plus, I finished <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/tomclancysghostreconadvancedwarfighterxbox360\">GRAW<\/a> which I had on loan from a friend just in time to start playing <a href=\"http:\/\/xbox.com\/games\/tomclancyrainbowsixvegas\/\">Vegas<\/a>. Note I said &#8220;free time&#8221; which is to say time when I wasn&#8217;t hanging out with my family. Typically during naps or after everyone was in bed, though I did skip at least one birthday party to play instead.  <\/li>\n<li>We had a &#8220;surprise&#8221; snow storm two days after Christmas. Not enough to be dangerous driving, but enough to make a snowman with my kids. It&#8217;s still there, though now that it&#8217;s 55 degrees, I&#8217;m guessing it will be totally melted by the time I get home from work. It&#8217;s been melting a little bit each day, so it&#8217;s been like watching the climax of Raiders of the Lost Ark in slow motion.  <\/li>\n<li>My wife and I finished watching season 5 of Alias last night. Fun, though it had really jumped the shark by Season 5. We watched the entire series on DVD, which really makes me wonder about the future of broadcast TV. We watched season 1 of Lost on DVD but we&#8217;ve been watching on TV ever since. I&#8217;m hooked on Lost, so there&#8217;s no way I could go back to DVDs at this point, but I&#8217;m thinking that DVD is a better way to go for most TV. I wonder how this will change TV storytelling.  <\/li>\n<li>I wish I could see how a show like Lost or Alias evolves over time. How much of the Rimbaldi story arc was mapped out before the show started? How did the production team deal with forced changes like Jennifer Garner&#8217;s pregnancy or the apparently surprise series cancellation?  <\/li>\n<li>I had 12 days off for the holidays, so it&#8217;s very tough to be back at work. As I suggested above, I did very little coding while I was off, so getting back in the saddle won&#8217;t be easy. It&#8217;s especially hard on my little boy that I&#8217;m back to work. He was acting up yesterday which is fairly unusual. I finally asked him if he was sad about me going back to work and he broke down crying. I&#8217;m very lucky to be a part of such a tight knit family.  <\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;ve been in my <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/06\/15\/Moving+On.aspx\">&#8220;new&#8221; job<\/a> for six months, but it seems like longer. I mean that in a good way. It feels like I fit better in this job, on a much smaller team, actually building stuff instead of just &#8220;evangelizing&#8221; it. Nothing against evangelism, I just think I burned out on that job. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So starts a new feature on DevHawk. As you might guess from the &#8220;1&#8243; in the title, I&#8217;m hoping to make this a regular feature. As I ease back into work, expect more tech related nuggets along with the more random stuff. I should admit, however, that I actually don&#8217;t drink coffee. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I gave up drinkin&#8217;, I gave up smokin&#8217;I gave up thinkin&#8217; all the time, stone cold revokenNo reason to my rhyme, I wasn&#8217;t jokin&#8217;If there&#8217;s a phony bone in me, I want it broken&#8220;Rub It In&#8221; by All Day Sucker I&#8217;m trying to write more in 2007.
