Speaking of DSL Tools, Software Factories co-author [Jack
Greenfield](http://blogs.msdn.com/jackgr) just started blogging. He has
[jumped
into](http://blogs.msdn.com/jackgr/archive/2004/12/20/327726.aspx) the
running debate between IBM’s [Grady
Booch](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog.jspa?blog=317&roll=0)
and a variety of MS folks including
[Steve](http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook/archive/2004/12/08/278507.aspx),
[Alan](http://blogs.msdn.com/alan_cameron_wills/archive/2004/11/11/255831.aspx)
and
[myself](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4ce7a305-e9a4-4fff-a3f4-095fcca52988).
He does a good job summarizing the argument including pointing out where
he and Booch agree:

> In particular, we share the conviction that packaging knowledge for
> reuse in patterns, languages, frameworks, tools and other form factors
> is “the right next stage in cutting the Gordian knot of software”.

Jack rightly points out that while we all agree on these mechanisms for
packaging knowledge that the devil is in the details. I look forward to
seeing more on these details from Jack in the future.
