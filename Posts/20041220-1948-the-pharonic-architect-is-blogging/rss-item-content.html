<p>Speaking of DSL Tools, Software Factories co-author <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jackgr">Jack Greenfield</a> just started blogging. He has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jackgr/archive/2004/12/20/327726.aspx">jumped into</a> the running debate between IBM's <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog.jspa?blog=317&amp;roll=0">Grady Booch</a> and a variety of MS folks including <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook/archive/2004/12/08/278507.aspx">Steve</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alan_cameron_wills/archive/2004/11/11/255831.aspx">Alan</a> and <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4ce7a305-e9a4-4fff-a3f4-095fcca52988">myself</a>. He does a good job summarizing the argument including pointing out where he and Booch agree:</p><blockquote><p>In particular, we share the conviction that packaging knowledge for reuse in patterns, languages, frameworks, tools and other form factors is “the right next stage in cutting the Gordian knot of software”. </p></blockquote><p>Jack rightly points out that while we all agree on these mechanisms for packaging knowledge that the devil is in the details. I look forward to seeing more on these details from Jack in the future.</p>
