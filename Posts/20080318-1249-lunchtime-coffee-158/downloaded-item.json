On the one hand, I&#8217;ve been a regular user of FolderShare for a while so it&#8217;s nice to see it get a face lift. On the other hand, it&#8217;s been over two years since Microsoft bought FolderShare and we&#8217;re only just now getting a new version, which is literally nothing more that a face lift &#8211; this version introduces no new functionality at all.  <\/li>\n<li>I was hoping to geek out vicariously via someone else&#8217;s hacking around with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/singularity\/\">Singularity<\/a>. Luckily, Matthew Podwysocki <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/podwysocki\/archive\/2008\/03\/11\/singularity-c-os-released-on-codeplex.aspx\">provides<\/a> just such an opportunity.  <\/li>\n<li>Looks like &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/prism\">Prism<\/a>&#8221; is the new CAB. Glenn Block has two extensive posts covering a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/gblock\/archive\/2008\/03\/12\/prism-launches-on-codeplex.aspx\">project overview<\/a> and their <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/gblock\/archive\/2008\/03\/12\/prism-ri-first-drop.aspx\">first drop<\/a>. I think it&#8217;s interesting that the Prism team is focused on building a reference implementation, and letting the framework eventually fall out. Reading thru the description, it sounds awesome. However, based on the massive increase of inbox throughput I&#8217;m experiencing since I <em>accepted<\/em> the new job, I can&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;ll have time to play with it. Maybe Matthew will start playing with Prism too! (via <a href=\"http:\/\/samgentile.com\/blogs\/samgentile\/archive\/2008\/03\/12\/new-and-notable-225.aspx\">Sam Gentile<\/a> &#8211; btw, thanks for the kind words on the new job Sam!) <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Sam, he points to a series by Bob Beauchemin entitled <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sqlskills.com\/blogs\/bobb\/2008\/02\/14\/MHOLINQToSQLAndEntityFrameworkPanaceaOrEvilIncarnatePart1.aspx\">LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework: Panacea or evil incarnate?<\/a> With a title like that, who can resist reading the whole series? Err, I can because LINQ 2 SQL &amp; EF performance just fell off my radar entirely. However I gotta agree with Sam&#8217;s point that he &#8220;can&#8217;t think of anyone more qualified than Bob&#8221; to tackle these questions.  <\/li>\n<li>Tomas Restrepo blogs his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winterdom.com\/weblog\/2008\/03\/13\/DevEnvironmentForPowerShell.aspx\">dev environment PS script<\/a> as well as a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winterdom.com\/weblog\/2008\/03\/17\/PowerShellFortune.aspx\">PS fortune script<\/a>. Personally, I use Chris Tavares&#8217; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tavaresstudios.com\/Blog\/post.aspx?id=0ccbfc67-fc1b-496b-b71e-a74301e583de\">vsvars wrapper for PS<\/a>, though I&#8217;ll gladly take an <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/nandal\/archive\/2008\/03\/10\/influence-the-future-of-windows-sdk-powershell-based-build-environment.aspx\">&#8220;official&#8221; PS based dev environment<\/a>. <\/li>\n<li>I wonder if Ted Neward will get jumped for <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/03\/15\/Mort+Means+Productivity.aspx\">admiring Mort<\/a> the way <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/nickmalik\/archive\/2007\/06\/19\/not-crazy-just-lateral-thinking.aspx\">Nick Malik did<\/a>. Given that Ted called himself Mort while Nick compared Mort to agile developers, I&#8217;m guess Ted will have to go back to his <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2006\/06\/26\/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx\">Vietnam analogy<\/a> if he wants to create controversy.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Ted, I agree <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/2008\/03\/15\/The+Reason+For+Conferences.aspx\">with his point<\/a> that conferences are about people. As a python pre-newbie (I figure I&#8217;ll reach full newbie status by the time I actually start my new job), I spent most of my PyCon time connecting with people rather than trying to learn technical stuff. Also, I love Ted&#8217;s WHISCEY acronym.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of PyCon, my soon-to-be new teammate Srivatsn Narayanan blogs <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/srivatsn\/archive\/2008\/03\/18\/pycon-2008.aspx\">his thoughts on PyCon<\/a>.
