  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the link to Chris tavares blog, Harry; I had honestly not seen it before. The trick he uses is cool, but not sure it would work for me (as I modify a bunch of other env variables on my profile and blindly replacing them with the output of vcvars32.bat might not work. 
In any case, my desire for creating a custom script was mostly so that I could keep a single script that worked on all my machines, regardless of the VS version installed, and since it's doing that very nicely, no need to switch for now.

On a different topic, Ted does have a good point. I haven't been to "real" conferences in a few years, but certainly the networking opportunities where by far the most productive part of the conferences. I wonder how many people totally miss that.

Looking forward to your thoughts on PyCon.... hope it wasn't all as bad as Bruce Eckel was complaining about :)]]></wp:comment_content>
