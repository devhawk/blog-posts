<p>Since this blog is now being syndicated on Architecture Center, I thought I should repost links to a recent pair of entries I wrote entitled &#8220;<a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=950774a9-b33b-4a46-bb2b-a481cf946251">Is the Middle-Tier Endangered?</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4c3d4706-8081-488c-a6e9-facd6364a058">The Endangered Middle-Tier, Part 2</a>&#8220;. The basic premise of the posts is that as computer hardware gets faster and service-orientation aims to carve our course-grained applications into finer-grained services, the value of running the business logic on a separate tier diminishes greatly. Add an improved programming model to the database (such as the CLR&#8217;s addition to SQL 2005) and I feel that, eventually, it will make more sense to run the services in-process with the database instead of on a separate tier. We&#8217;re not there yet &#8211; in addition to continued hardware improvements, we need a major improvement to the overall management infrastructure &#8211; but I think it will happen. The question is, do <i>you</i> think it will happen? </p>
