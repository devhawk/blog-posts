<p></p><p>Since this blog is now being syndicated on Architecture Center, I thought I should repost links to a recent pair of entries I wrote entitled "<a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=950774a9-b33b-4a46-bb2b-a481cf946251">Is the Middle-Tier Endangered?</a>" and "<a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4c3d4706-8081-488c-a6e9-facd6364a058">The Endangered Middle-Tier, Part 2</a>". The basic premise of the posts is that as computer hardware gets faster and service-orientation aims to carve our course-grained applications into finer-grained services, the value of running the business logic on a separate tier diminishes greatly. Add an improved programming model to the database (such as the CLR's addition to SQL 2005) and I feel that, eventually, it will make more sense to run the services in-process with the database instead of on a separate tier. We're not there yet - in addition to continued hardware improvements, we need a major improvement to the overall management infrastructure - but I think it will happen. The question is, do <i>you</i> think it will happen? </p>
