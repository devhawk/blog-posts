I’ve been so busy with last minute PDC prep that I totally missed that
my teammates shipped the [IronPython 2.0 Release
Candidate](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=17404).
Awesome work guys!

If you’re an IPy user, this is your last chance to hammer on the release
and raise any issues to our attention before we ship. If you find
anything, please [file a
bug](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/WorkItem/Create.aspx) and report
it on the [mailing
list](http://lists.ironpython.com/listinfo.cgi/users-ironpython.com)
right away. For those who haven’t seen it, Dave from our test team has a
[handy guide](http://knowbody.livejournal.com/7964.html) for reporting
bugs, including a link to the bug template.

Next step, RTM!
