<p>I&#8217;ve been so busy with last minute PDC prep that I totally missed that my teammates shipped the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=17404">IronPython 2.0 Release Candidate</a>. Awesome work guys!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an IPy user, this is your last chance to hammer on the release and raise any issues to our attention before we ship. If you find anything, please <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/WorkItem/Create.aspx">file a bug</a> and report it on the <a href="http://lists.ironpython.com/listinfo.cgi/users-ironpython.com">mailing list</a> right away. For those who haven&#8217;t seen it, Dave from our test team has a <a href="http://knowbody.livejournal.com/7964.html">handy guide</a> for reporting bugs, including a link to the bug template. </p>
<p>Next step, RTM!</p>
