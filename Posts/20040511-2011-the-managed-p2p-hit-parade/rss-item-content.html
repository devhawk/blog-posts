<p>From the one-less-thing-for-me-to-do department, <a href="http://www.thoughtpost.com/blog/">Chris Dix</a> has created a <a href="http://www.thoughtpost.com/p2p.aspx">managed wrapped</a> of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/p2psdk/p2p/portal.asp">WinXP P2P SDK</a>. He also has several sample apps, including a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a>-inspired <a href="http://www.thoughtpost.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=bc4b467e-7f55-4e01-b954-029602c4ca31">MagicFolder</a>. According to his site, Chris plans to extend his library to support web services (WSE custom channels?) which should be very cool. </p><p>It's funny, I used to get really sad when I discovered someone else had built something that I had started building. Especially if, as in this case, theirs was better. Now, I'm just relieved that I can reuse the library without having to build all the surrounding infrastructure. I'm glad I never released my <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=bae4f625-5ef1-427c-b222-da96abd7aa6f">managed P2P wrapper</a>, it would be one more thing for me to kill. Like my HtmlReader stuff. I <em>still</em> get people looking for it even though I killed it a while ago. (Hasn't everyone figured out they should use <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=B90FDDCE-E60D-43F8-A5C4-C3BD760564BC"><font color="#000080">SGML Reader</font></a> instead?)</p>
