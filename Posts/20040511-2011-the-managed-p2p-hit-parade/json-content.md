From the one-less-thing-for-me-to-do department, [Chris
Dix](http://www.thoughtpost.com/blog/) has created a [managed
wrapped](http://www.thoughtpost.com/p2p.aspx) of the [WinXP P2P
SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/p2psdk/p2p/portal.asp).
He also has several sample apps, including a
[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/)-inspired
[MagicFolder](http://www.thoughtpost.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=bc4b467e-7f55-4e01-b954-029602c4ca31).
According to his site, Chris plans to extend his library to support web
services (WSE custom channels?) which should be very cool.

It’s funny, I used to get really sad when I discovered someone else had
built something that I had started building. Especially if, as in this
case, theirs was better. Now, I’m just relieved that I can reuse the
library without having to build all the surrounding infrastructure. I’m
glad I never released my [managed P2P
wrapper](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=bae4f625-5ef1-427c-b222-da96abd7aa6f),
it would be one more thing for me to kill. Like my HtmlReader stuff. I
*still* get people looking for it even though I killed it a while ago.
(Hasn’t everyone figured out they should use [SGML
Reader](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=B90FDDCE-E60D-43F8-A5C4-C3BD760564BC) instead?)
