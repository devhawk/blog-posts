<p>I see from <a href="http://snowstormlife.com/blog/archive/2004/01/11/572.aspx">Jim</a>, <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/2498.aspx">Rory</a> and <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/01/16.html#a6213">Scoble </a>that there's a "<a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00001562.html">Weblog Meetup</a>" on Wed. evening. It's at a <a href="http://www.leilanilanes.com/">bowling alley</a>. I hate bowling. I mean, I really hate it. As in I'd consider lighting myself on fire to get out of bowling. But this bowling alley has <a href="http://www.leilanilanes.com/Lani%20Kai%20Lounge.htm">good beer</a> and Wed is <em>not</em> karoke night. So I think I can make it.</p>
