I see from
[Jim](http://snowstormlife.com/blog/archive/2004/01/11/572.aspx),
[Rory](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/2498.aspx) and
[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/01/16.html#a6213)that
there’s a “[Weblog
Meetup](http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00001562.html)” on Wed.
evening. It’s at a [bowling alley](http://www.leilanilanes.com/). I hate
bowling. I mean, I really hate it. As in I’d consider lighting myself on
fire to get out of bowling. But this bowling alley has [good
beer](http://www.leilanilanes.com/Lani%20Kai%20Lounge.htm) and Wed is
*not* karoke night. So I think I can make it.
