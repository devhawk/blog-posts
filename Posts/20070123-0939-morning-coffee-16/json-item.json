I got <a href=\"http:\/\/live.xbox.com\/en-US\/profile\/Achievements\/ViewAchievementDetails.aspx?compareTo=RayTracer&amp;tid=%09%5d%3abn%2bi6%05%03\">60 points in Dead Rising<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/live.xbox.com\/en-US\/profile\/Achievements\/ViewAchievementDetails.aspx?compareTo=RayTracer&amp;tid=%09%5d%3adh)k0%01%02\">100 points in NHL 07<\/a>. I have played ten games + three arcade games for a maximum possible Gamerscore of 10,600 and a Gamerscore &#8220;conversion rate&#8221; of 10.28%. I wonder how good that is? All the leader boards I&#8217;ve seen rate purely on Gamerscore.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of games, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.obsidianent.com\/\">Obsidian<\/a> (of Neverwind Nights fame) is working on an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.obsidianent.com\/aliens_announced.html\">Aliens RPG<\/a>! Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.edery.org\/2007\/01\/game-design-research-ala-avellone\/\">this post<\/a> by Chris Avellone of Obsidian on Game Design Research (via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.edery.org\/\">Game Tycoon<\/a>). <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.richardgrimes.com\/\">Richard Grimes&#8217;<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.grimes.demon.co.uk\/workshops\/instrumentationWS.htm\">.NET Instrumentation Workshop<\/a> rocks. Richard also has extensive workshops on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grimes.demon.co.uk\/workshops\/securityWS.htm\">.NET Security<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grimes.demon.co.uk\/workshops\/fusionWS.htm\">.NET Fusion<\/a>\u00a0(aka runtime binding). If they&#8217;re as good as the instrumentation workshop, they&#8217;re worth a read.  <\/li>\n<li>In my SSB\/WF prototypes, I&#8217;ve simply been writing to the console. The lo-tech brute force works okay for a console app, but not at all when I move my code into a shared library. So I decided to bite the bullet now and translate the Console.WriteLine calls into TraceSource calls. My prototype isn&#8217;t that big (yet), but it went pretty smooth nonetheless. I currently have three TraceSources in my solution &#8211; one for the host, one for my SSB activities &amp; workflow service and one for the persistence engine (I just inherited from\u00a0SqlWorkflowPersistenceService and added the trace calls). I&#8217;m sure in time, I&#8217;ll wish I had set up my TraceSources differently, but for now it works. <\/li>\n<li>The one feature I lost moving from Console.WriteLine to TraceSources was color support. Since I am creating voluminous tracing data, I used color coding to indicate which part of the application the trace information was coming from. Of course, the OOB ConsoleTraceListener doesn&#8217;t have any mechanism to color code the output. I hacked up a ColorConsoleTraceListener in a couple of minutes that worked great. I say &#8220;hacked&#8221; because my color choosing code is currently hard coded, rather than being stored the config file. If I get the time to change that, I&#8217;ll post the code here. <\/li>\n<li>While researching ASP.NET&#8217;s Membership system, I found <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2006\/02\/24\/ASP.NET-2.0-Membership_2C00_-Roles_2C00_-Forms-Authentication_2C00_-and-Security-Resources-.aspx\">this Scott Guthrie post<\/a> with links to ASP.NET providers for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeproject.com\/aspnet\/MySQLMembershipProvider.asp\">MySql<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/aa479070.aspx\">Oracle<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eggheadcafe.com\/articles\/20051119.asp\">SQLite<\/a>. I&#8217;ve wondered about the lack of a simple file-based ASP.NET role\/membership provider and even started hacking together an XML based one. But the availability of a <a href=\"http:\/\/sqlite.phxsoftware.com\/\">.NET SQLite data provider<\/a> makes that an interesting option. XML would be human readable, but porting the <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2006\/04\/13\/442772.aspx\">existing SQL providers<\/a> to SQLite would probably be easier. <\/li>\n<li>Politics 2.0 in action: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.talkingpointsmemo.com\/\">Talking Points Memo<\/a> is enouraging you (aka <a href=\"http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,1569514,00.html\">Time Magazine&#8217;s Person of the Year<\/a>) to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.talkingpointsmemo.com\/archives\/012075.php\">record your own response<\/a> to tonight&#8217;s State of the Union.
