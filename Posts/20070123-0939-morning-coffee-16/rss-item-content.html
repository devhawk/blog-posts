<ul><li>Forgot to say this yesterday, but I'm happy the Colts are in the Super Bowl. Well, I guess I'm more happy that New England <em>isn't</em> in it. They've won it enough lately. I wish the Saints has made it, but at least this way I have no question who to root for on Super Bowl Sunday.  </li><li>My Gamerscore <a href="http://gamerscorechart.com/theme/xbox/raytracer.png">cracked 1000</a> over the weekend. I got <a href="http://live.xbox.com/en-US/profile/Achievements/ViewAchievementDetails.aspx?compareTo=RayTracer&amp;tid=%09%5d%3abn%2bi6%05%03">60 points in Dead Rising</a> and <a href="http://live.xbox.com/en-US/profile/Achievements/ViewAchievementDetails.aspx?compareTo=RayTracer&amp;tid=%09%5d%3adh)k0%01%02">100 points in NHL 07</a>. I have played ten games + three arcade games for a maximum possible Gamerscore of 10,600 and a Gamerscore "conversion rate" of 10.28%. I wonder how good that is? All the leader boards I've seen rate purely on Gamerscore.  </li><li>Speaking of games, <a href="http://www.obsidianent.com/">Obsidian</a> (of Neverwind Nights fame) is working on an <a href="http://www.obsidianent.com/aliens_announced.html">Aliens RPG</a>! Check out <a href="http://www.edery.org/2007/01/game-design-research-ala-avellone/">this post</a> by Chris Avellone of Obsidian on Game Design Research (via <a href="http://www.edery.org/">Game Tycoon</a>). </li><li><a href="http://www.richardgrimes.com/">Richard Grimes'</a><a href="http://www.grimes.demon.co.uk/workshops/instrumentationWS.htm">.NET Instrumentation Workshop</a> rocks. Richard also has extensive workshops on <a href="http://www.grimes.demon.co.uk/workshops/securityWS.htm">.NET Security</a> and <a href="http://www.grimes.demon.co.uk/workshops/fusionWS.htm">.NET Fusion</a> (aka runtime binding). If they're as good as the instrumentation workshop, they're worth a read.  </li><li>In my SSB/WF prototypes, I've simply been writing to the console. The lo-tech brute force works okay for a console app, but not at all when I move my code into a shared library. So I decided to bite the bullet now and translate the Console.WriteLine calls into TraceSource calls. My prototype isn't that big (yet), but it went pretty smooth nonetheless. I currently have three TraceSources in my solution - one for the host, one for my SSB activities &amp; workflow service and one for the persistence engine (I just inherited from SqlWorkflowPersistenceService and added the trace calls). I'm sure in time, I'll wish I had set up my TraceSources differently, but for now it works. </li><li>The one feature I lost moving from Console.WriteLine to TraceSources was color support. Since I am creating voluminous tracing data, I used color coding to indicate which part of the application the trace information was coming from. Of course, the OOB ConsoleTraceListener doesn't have any mechanism to color code the output. I hacked up a ColorConsoleTraceListener in a couple of minutes that worked great. I say "hacked" because my color choosing code is currently hard coded, rather than being stored the config file. If I get the time to change that, I'll post the code here. </li><li>While researching ASP.NET's Membership system, I found <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/02/24/ASP.NET-2.0-Membership_2C00_-Roles_2C00_-Forms-Authentication_2C00_-and-Security-Resources-.aspx">this Scott Guthrie post</a> with links to ASP.NET providers for <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/MySQLMembershipProvider.asp">MySql</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479070.aspx">Oracle</a> and <a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/20051119.asp">SQLite</a>. I've wondered about the lack of a simple file-based ASP.NET role/membership provider and even started hacking together an XML based one. But the availability of a <a href="http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/">.NET SQLite data provider</a> makes that an interesting option. XML would be human readable, but porting the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/04/13/442772.aspx">existing SQL providers</a> to SQLite would probably be easier. </li><li>Politics 2.0 in action: <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/">Talking Points Memo</a> is enouraging you (aka <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html">Time Magazine's Person of the Year</a>) to <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/012075.php">record your own response</a> to tonight's State of the Union. Basically record your response via camcorder, webcam or cellphone. Then upload it to YouTube and add it to the <a href="http://youtube.com/group/tpmsotu">TPM SOTU group</a>. With President Bush's approval rating at <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/22/opinion/polls/main2384943.shtml">all time lows</a>, I'm guessing these videos will be venting some of the pent up hostility towards this administration.</li></ul>
