<p>I recently had to repave my main machine. Among other things I installed <a href="http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&amp;page=byoa/prem">MSN Premium</a> which I use to manage my <a href="mailto:harrypierson@hotmail.com">hotmail</a> and <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net">DevHawk</a> emails. However, this time I installed the <a href="http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&amp;page=features/connector">Outlook Connector for MSN</a>, which enables you to use Outlook 2002 or later to manage your hotmail account. Calendar, contacts, tasks, notes, everything. Very very cool. Now, there's no need to install the MSN Premium client at all...or is there? </p><p>The coolest feature of the Outlook Connector is that it delivers all of my personal hotmail to a totally different top level folder inside Outlook. Does anyone know how to do that for POP3 mailboxes? I tried using Outlook to manage my DevHawk email, but then all that mail gets mingled together with my work email. I want the exact same experience for my DevHawk email inside Outlook as I get for my hotmail. However, it appears that while you can have multiple PSTs, you have to designate one as the new mail delivery location default for <em>all</em> accounts. I.e. it doesn't appear that you can configure this on a per-account basis. I'm guessing the Outlook Connector is overriding this for my hotmail.</p><p>Anyone have any ideas on how to deliver email from two different accounts to two different locations? (Other than the obvious “use rules” - I had issues with that approach.)</p>
