Now, there&#8217;s no need to install the MSN Premium client at all&#8230;or is there? <\/p>\n<p>The coolest feature of the Outlook Connector is that it delivers all of my personal hotmail to a totally different top level folder inside Outlook. Does anyone know how to do that for POP3 mailboxes? I tried using Outlook to manage my DevHawk email, but then all that mail gets mingled together with my work email. I want the exact same experience for my DevHawk email inside Outlook as I get for my hotmail. However, it appears that while you can have multiple PSTs, you have to designate one as the new mail delivery location default for <em>all<\/em> accounts. I.e. it doesn&#8217;t appear that you can configure this on a per-account basis. I&#8217;m guessing the Outlook Connector is overriding this for my hotmail.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone have any ideas on how to deliver email from two different accounts to two different locations?
