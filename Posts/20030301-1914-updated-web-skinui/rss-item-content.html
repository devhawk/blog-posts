I finally got around to updating my <a href="prj_webskin.aspx">Web.SkinUI project page</a>. I've posted a slightly updated version of the code that allows DB connection strings to be specified in the web.config file. I've also posted the code (without docs) from the follow-up article that compiles the skinned pages on request, just like WebForms do. Enjoy.
