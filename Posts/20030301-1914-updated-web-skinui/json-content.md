I finally got around to updating my [Web.SkinUI project
page](prj_webskin.aspx). I’ve posted a slightly updated version of the
code that allows DB connection strings to be specified in the web.config
file. I’ve also posted the code (without docs) from the follow-up
article that compiles the skinned pages on request, just like WebForms
do. Enjoy.
