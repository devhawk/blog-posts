I didn&#8217;t get a chance to blog all day yesterday, so here&#8217;s a quick recap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;ve run into a bunch of people who I first met at TechEd Malaysia 2002. In particular, Adrian and Rathi who both wanted to see pictures of Patrick. The big bummer of only spending two days here is that I didn&#8217;t get to do much more that the conference. <\/li>\n<li>After the sessions on Wednesday, I hung out with a bunch of the other speakers at dinner. Several of the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/netframework\/community\/rd\/default.aspx\">RD&#8217;s<\/a> who spoke at TechEd US also came to our <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/PermaLink.aspx?guid=40a26f60-2238-405d-98fc-19898299f031\">Architect Road Rally<\/a> and had a great time. Always nice to be told you threw a great party.<\/li>\n<li>Thursday started\u00a0 with Gurpreet&#8217;s session on Architecture Vision &amp; Direction. I didn&#8217;t think this session did as well as the EA talk the day before. Part of that comes from the fact the EA talk set a high bar, but some of it comes from the fact that the V&amp;D talk wasn&#8217;t as polished. In contrast, I did much better with my Metropolis Thursday than the SOA Data talk on Wednesday. Maybe I just need one talk to get back in the groove &#8211; I usually think I do better in my second session.<\/li>\n<li>After our sessions, lunch, and hanging around in the cabana with some other attendees, Aaron (the local Architect Evangelist) drove Gurp and I around <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/overview\/series\/\">Putrajaya<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/pathelland\">Pat<\/a> often points out when he presents Metropolis that you can&#8217;t bulldoze Boston just because the roads aren&#8217;t straight. However, you can build a new city about a half an hour away and move into it when it&#8217;s finished. That&#8217;s Putrajaya &#8211; the new administrative center of Malaysia.\u00a0 It was stunning &#8211; huge and ultra modern. But it was also strange as it is completely underutilized, so far anyway. We also did a little shopping and I was able to find a few things for the family back home.<\/li>\n<li>Last night we had a regional architect dinner, where we got to hang out with a bunch of the local architects in the region. Lots of good discussion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Next stop &#8211; China!<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m sitting in the Kuala Lumpur airport &#8211; my flight to Beijing leaves in about half an hour.
