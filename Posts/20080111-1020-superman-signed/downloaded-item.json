Alex &#8220;the Great&#8221; Ovechkin (aka <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/07\/13\/Ovechkin+As+Superman.aspx\">Superman<\/a>) signed the biggest contract in NHL history &#8211; $124 million over 13 years. <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.aol.com\/fanhouse\/2008\/01\/10\/ovechkins-deal-wealthiest-in-nhl-history\/\">According to Eric McErlain<\/a>, that&#8217;s an average of over $300k per hour of ice time and $5k per shift. Nice work if you can get it. <\/p>\n<p>Actually, all kidding aside, this is a great move for the Caps. <\/p>\n<p>The financial bar was set last summer when Sid &#8220;the Kid&#8221; Crosby signed a 5-year $43.5 million contract extension &#8211; about $8.7 million a season. Since then, Caps fans have had to suffer thru <a href=\"http:\/\/www.canada.com\/montrealgazette\/news\/sports\/story.html?id=e20c9251-4521-47f0-9f16-647c438360e6&amp;k=16946\">rumor<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hockeybuzz.com\/blog.php?post_id=12395\">after<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypost.com\/seven\/11252007\/sports\/opt_out__alex_249480.htm\">rumor<\/a> that our man Alex wasn&#8217;t going to be playing in DC much longer. However, the suggestion that Ovechkin would be leaving never made any sense to me. He was slated to become a <em>restricted<\/em> free agent this summer &#8211; meaning the Caps would have the opportunity to match any offer. Furthermore, the max any player can get under the <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2005\/07\/13\/Finally.aspx\">new CBA<\/a> is 20% of the salary cap &#8211; currently about $50 million. So it was pretty obvious Ovechkin was going to stay a Cap and get paid somewhere between $8.7 and $10 a season.\u00a0 <\/p>\n<p>More impressive than the dollars is the length of the contract. Not only is it the wealthiest in the league, it&#8217;s the second longest (Islanders goalie signed a $67.5 million 15 year contract before the start of last season). This contract means Ovechkin is slated to spend at least 16 years in a Caps uniform. In this era of free agency, more often than not you end up &#8220;rooting for the laundry&#8221; since the players come and go so quickly. It&#8217;s nice to know the #8 Caps jersey I got for Christmas will be relevant until the 2020&#8242;s.<\/p>\n<p>Also, signing Ovechkin for that long makes massive financial sense, even if some &#8220;experts&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thehockeynews.com\/articles\/12572-Analysis-Ovechkin-deal-proves-owners-can-spend.html\">can&#8217;t (won&#8217;t) see the value<\/a>. The salary cap increased from $39 million for the 2005-06 season to $50 million this season. Can the league sustain 13% revenue growth for the foreseeable future? If so, the salary cap will be in the $100 million range by the time Crosby&#8217;s deal expires. Even if revenues only grow at half that rate, we&#8217;re still looking at a salary cap in the low $70 millions by 2013. So Crosby will be looking to make at least $14 million and maybe as much as $20 million per season when he resigns. Viewed that way, getting Ovechkin for &#8220;only&#8221; $9.5 mil a season makes good financial sense. <\/p>\n<p>Of course, the last time the Caps committed this kind of money to a superstar, it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2007\/10\/11\/AR2007101102188.html\">didn&#8217;t work out so well<\/a>. But unlike Jagr, who got his new contract before skating shift one for the Caps, we know what #8 can do while wearing the <a href=\"http:\/\/nhllogos.blogspot.com\/2008\/01\/result-canucks-vs-capitals.html\">Eagle<\/a>. Owner Ted Leonsis isn&#8217;t paying for potential on blind faith, he knows what Ovechkin can do and how much he means to this team. Based on the past two and 1\/2 seasons, I think Leonsis is getting his money&#8217;s worth.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of <a href=\"http:\/\/ted.aol.com\/\">Ted<\/a>, my father ran into him @ the seasons ticket holder&#8217;s event they held last night. When he mentioned that he&#8217;s &#8220;Devhawk&#8217;s Dad&#8221;, Ted recalled how I &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2004\/02\/19\/Doing+The+Unthinkable.aspx\">reamed him a new one<\/a>&#8221; as well as <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/07\/06\/Meeting+Ted+Leonsis.aspx\">meeting me<\/a>. For the record, I <em>still <\/em>think trading Bondra was a mistake, though time has demonstrated it was a fairly minor one. More importantly, it was an isolated mistake. Since then, I think Ted and the Caps have done almost everything right, both on and off the ice. If you&#8217;re reading this Ted, keep up the good work and I take back that whole &#8220;abomination to the sport of hockey&#8221; thing.<\/p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t look now, but the Caps are 12-6-4 since the <a href=\"http:\/\/capitals.nhl.com\/team\/app?articleid=344172&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page\">changing coaches<\/a>. Had they been playing at that pace all season, they&#8217;d have around 55 points and the second best record in the Eastern Conference right now. Good to know, but not very relevant since they did, in fact, start the season 6-14-1. However, if they can stay on this pace for the second half of their season, they would end with around 93 points &#8211; probably enough to get them in the playoffs. (Last year&#8217;s eighth seed ended with 92 points.) Furthermore, Carolina currently leads the Southeast Division, but they&#8217;re only on pace to reach 86 points. So even with the horrific start, the Caps are still poised to make a playoff run.<\/p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"http:\/\/capitals.nhl.com\/team\/app\/?service=page&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;articleid=349546\">press release<\/a> announcing the contract, Alex is quoted saying &#8220;I want to bring the Stanley Cup to Washington&#8221;. Even if they do make the playoffs, I think the Caps are still a year or two away from honestly being competitive for the Cup &#8211; though I&#8217;d love to be wrong about that. Either way, it&#8217;s nice to know Alex has 13 years to make the Caps&#8217; Stanley Cup dreams a reality. <\/p>\n<p>To <a href=\"http:\/\/dumpnchase.wordpress.com\/2008\/01\/11\/not-to-worry-kids\/\">quote<\/a> Mike Vogel, &#8220;It feels like morning in Washington.&#8221; I may be displaced in the &#8220;wrong&#8221; Washington, but I feel it just the same.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Big news yesterday for Washington Capitals fans.
