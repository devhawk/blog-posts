<blockquote><p>Personally, I am listening to music chosen for me by Comcast right now and a combination subscription/buy model sounds most interesting to me. Most music I listen to isn&#8217;t worth owning. But the RIAA doesn&#8217;t seem particularly concerned about music listeners.<br>[Robert Scoble - <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/08/27.html//la10971">Om says tough times ahead for Jobs</a>]</p>

<p>Scoble&#8217;s comment that most music isn&#8217;t worth owning really resonated with me. I think we can generalize &#8211; most <em>content</em> isn&#8217;t worth owning. Music, movies, books, etc. I find it interesting how the own vs. rent model works in each of these independent forms of media. For example, most people want to &#8220;own&#8221; their music, but have no problem renting movies. Most people buy books, even though libraries are pretty prevelent, but I wonder if that&#8217;s more related to availability. How many popular books are at the local library to borrow?</p>
<p>I hope we see some dovetailing around the rental model across all content types in the future.</p>
