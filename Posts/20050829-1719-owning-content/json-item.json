I think we can generalize &#8211; most <em>content<\/em> isn&#8217;t worth owning. Music, movies, books, etc. I find it interesting how the own vs. rent model works in each of these independent forms of media. For example, most people want to &#8220;own&#8221; their music, but have no problem renting movies. Most people buy books, even though libraries are pretty prevelent, but I wonder if that&#8217;s more related to availability. How many popular books are at the local library to borrow?<\/p>\n<p>I hope we see some dovetailing around the rental model across all content types in the future.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Personally, I am listening to music chosen for me by Comcast right now and a combination subscription\/buy model sounds most interesting to me.

Radio is a different experience where you are not in control of which content you play. When I use Napster To Go, I can pick which music I want to listen to. With Scoble&#8217;s Comcast example or satellite radio or MSN Radio for that matter, I can pick genres, but not specific content. Certainly, there&#8217;s a place for both.<\/p>\n","parent":0}],"attachments":[],"comment_count":2,"comment_status":"closed","custom_fields":{"dasblog_entryid":["af1d7e1f-48db-4f1d-a874-f87eb92e7247"],"dasblog_compressedtitle":["Owning+Content"],"dasblog_compressedtitleunique":["2005\/08\/30\/Owning+Content"]}},"previous_url":"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2005\/08\/29\/scott-charney-on-critical-infrastructure-protection\/","next_url":"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2005\/08\/30\/architecture-at-the-intersection\/"}
