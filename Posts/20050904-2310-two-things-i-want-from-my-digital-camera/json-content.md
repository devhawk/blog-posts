GPS and Voice Recording

[Omar](http://www.shahine.com/omar/) does a good job [covering the GPS
front](http://www.shahine.com/omar/PermaLink,guid,52aa57ef-7998-4b21-8a9d-b7810113c980.aspx),
so I won’t bother repeating those reasons. However, often when I’m
taking pictures of something, I want to record a little voice note so I
can later remember some details about whatever I’m shooting. Maybe the
place has history, or maybe something caught my eye. Often, looking back
at picture I can remember those things, but not always.

And since I’m asking, I wouldn’t mind bluetooth so I could shoot
pictures of my kids and send them to my parents via my mobile phone.
Sure, the phone has a camera…a crappy one. Fun for [my MSN
Space](http://spaces.msn.com/members/devhawk/), but not for any serious
picture taking.
