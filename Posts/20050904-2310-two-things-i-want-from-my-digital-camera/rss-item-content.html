<p>GPS and Voice Recording</p><p><a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/">Omar</a> does a good job <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/PermaLink,guid,52aa57ef-7998-4b21-8a9d-b7810113c980.aspx">covering the GPS front</a>, so I won't bother repeating those reasons. However, often when I'm taking pictures of something, I want to record a little voice note so I can later remember some details about whatever I'm shooting. Maybe the place has history, or maybe something caught my eye. Often, looking back at picture I can remember those things, but not always.</p><p>And since I'm asking, I wouldn't mind bluetooth so I could shoot pictures of my kids and send them to my parents via my mobile phone. Sure, the phone has a camera...a crappy one. Fun for <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/devhawk/">my MSN Space</a>, but not for any serious picture taking.</p>
