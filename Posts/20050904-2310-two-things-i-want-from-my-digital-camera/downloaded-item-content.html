<p>GPS and Voice Recording</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/">Omar</a> does a good job <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/PermaLink,guid,52aa57ef-7998-4b21-8a9d-b7810113c980.aspx">covering the GPS front</a>, so I won&#8217;t bother repeating those reasons. However, often when I&#8217;m taking pictures of something, I want to record a little voice note so I can later remember some details about whatever I&#8217;m shooting. Maybe the place has history, or maybe something caught my eye. Often, looking back at picture I can remember those things, but not always.</p>
<p>And since I&#8217;m asking, I wouldn&#8217;t mind bluetooth so I could shoot pictures of my kids and send them to my parents via my mobile phone. Sure, the phone has a camera&#8230;a crappy one. Fun for <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/devhawk/">my MSN Space</a>, but not for any serious picture taking.</p>
