<p>So it would make a crappy song, but the title of this post is still true. This is my first post on the new-and-improved DevHawk running on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;decided a while back that it was time to modernize my blog engine &#8211; <a href="http://dasblog.info/">DasBlog </a>is getting a little long of tooth and there hasn&#8217;t been a new release in over two years. I spent some time looking at different options, but settled on WordPress for much the same reasons&nbsp;<a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2010/09/27/wordpress-com-and-windows-live-partnering-together-and-providing-an-upgrade-for-30-million-windows-live-spaces-customers.aspx">Windows Live did</a>:&nbsp;&#8220;host of impressive capabilities&#8221;, scalable and widely used. Also, it&#8217;s very extensible, has about a billion available themes and has a very active development community. I was able to find plugins to <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/clean-archives-reloaded/">replicate DasBlog&#8217;s archive page</a> as well as <a href="http://www.emmanuelgeorjon.com/en/plugin-eg-archives-1745/">archive widget</a> that replicated custom functionality that I added to DasBlog via <a href="http://dasblog.info/CreatingCustomMacrosForDasBlog.aspx">custom macros</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, moving eight years worth of posts to a new engine took quite a bit of effort and planning. I wanted to make sure that I maintained all my posts and comments as well as take advantage of some of the new features available to me from WordPress. For example, I took the opportunity to flatten my list of categories and move most of them to be tags. I also went thru and converted all of my old code snippets to use <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter</a> instead of <a href="http://codehtmler.codeplex.com/releases/view/9505">CodeHTMLer</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/04/05/pygments-for-windows-live-writer/">Pygments for WL Writer</a>. Of course, I automated almost all of the conversion process. For anyone interested in following my footsteps, I <a href="https://bitbucket.org/devhawk/dasblog-wxr-convert">published my PowerShell scripts</a> for converting DasBlog to the <a href="http://ipggi.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/the-wordpress-extended-rss-wxr-exportimport-xml-document-format-decoded-and-explained/">WordPress WXR import/export format</a> up on BitBucket.</p>
<p>Not only did I want to save all my data, I also wanted to make sure I saved my search engine mojo (if I have any left after blogging a paltry six times in the past sixteen months). So I hacked up a WordPress plugin to redirect my old DasBlog links to the new WordPress URLs. That&#8217;s <a href="https://bitbucket.org/devhawk/devhawk-redirect">up on BitBucket as well</a> for anyone who wants it. It&#8217;s got some DevHawk specific bits in there (like the category cleanup) but if you tore those parts out it would be usable for any DasBlog-to-WordPress conversion. If there&#8217;s interest, maybe I&#8217;ll write up how the conversion scripts and redirect plugin work.</p>
<p>The plan is that now that I&#8217;m finally done moving my blog over the new back end, I will actually start writing on a more regular basis again. We&#8217;ll see how that works out.</p>
