This is my first post on the new-and-improved DevHawk running on <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I\u00a0decided a while back that it was time to modernize my blog engine &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/dasblog.info\/\">DasBlog <\/a>is getting a little long of tooth and there hasn&#8217;t been a new release in over two years. I spent some time looking at different options, but settled on WordPress for much the same reasons\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/windowsteamblog.com\/windows_live\/b\/windowslive\/archive\/2010\/09\/27\/wordpress-com-and-windows-live-partnering-together-and-providing-an-upgrade-for-30-million-windows-live-spaces-customers.aspx\">Windows Live did<\/a>:\u00a0&#8220;host of impressive capabilities&#8221;, scalable and widely used. Also, it&#8217;s very extensible, has about a billion available themes and has a very active development community. I was able to find plugins to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.viper007bond.com\/wordpress-plugins\/clean-archives-reloaded\/\">replicate DasBlog&#8217;s archive page<\/a> as well as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emmanuelgeorjon.com\/en\/plugin-eg-archives-1745\/\">archive widget<\/a> that replicated custom functionality that I added to DasBlog via <a href=\"http:\/\/dasblog.info\/CreatingCustomMacrosForDasBlog.aspx\">custom macros<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, moving eight years worth of posts to a new engine took quite a bit of effort and planning. I wanted to make sure that I maintained all my posts and comments as well as take advantage of some of the new features available to me from WordPress. For example, I took the opportunity to flatten my list of categories and move most of them to be tags. I also went thru and converted all of my old code snippets to use <a href=\"http:\/\/alexgorbatchev.com\/SyntaxHighlighter\/\">SyntaxHighlighter<\/a> instead of <a href=\"http:\/\/codehtmler.codeplex.com\/releases\/view\/9505\">CodeHTMLer<\/a> or\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2009\/04\/05\/pygments-for-windows-live-writer\/\">Pygments for WL Writer<\/a>. Of course, I automated almost all of the conversion process. For anyone interested in following my footsteps, I <a href=\"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/devhawk\/dasblog-wxr-convert\">published my PowerShell scripts<\/a> for converting DasBlog to the <a href=\"http:\/\/ipggi.wordpress.com\/2011\/03\/16\/the-wordpress-extended-rss-wxr-exportimport-xml-document-format-decoded-and-explained\/\">WordPress WXR import\/export format<\/a> up on BitBucket.<\/p>\n<p>Not only did I want to save all my data, I also wanted to make sure I saved my search engine mojo (if I have any left after blogging a paltry six times in the past sixteen months). So I hacked up a WordPress plugin to redirect my old DasBlog links to the new WordPress URLs. That&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/devhawk\/devhawk-redirect\">up on BitBucket as well<\/a> for anyone who wants it. It&#8217;s got some DevHawk specific bits in there (like the category cleanup) but if you tore those parts out it would be usable for any DasBlog-to-WordPress conversion. If there&#8217;s interest, maybe I&#8217;ll write up how the conversion scripts and redirect plugin work.<\/p>\n<p>The plan is that now that I&#8217;m finally done moving my blog over the new back end, I will actually start writing on a more regular basis again. We&#8217;ll see how that works out.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So it would make a crappy song, but the title of this post is still true.
