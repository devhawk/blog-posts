So it would make a crappy song, but the title of this post is still true. This is my first post on the new-and-improved DevHawk running on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.

I decided a while back that it was time to modernize my blog engine - <a href="http://dasblog.info/">DasBlog </a>is getting a little long of tooth and there hasn't been a new release in over two years. I spent some time looking at different options, but settled on WordPress for much the same reasons <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2010/09/27/wordpress-com-and-windows-live-partnering-together-and-providing-an-upgrade-for-30-million-windows-live-spaces-customers.aspx">Windows Live did</a>: "host of impressive capabilities", scalable and widely used. Also, it's very extensible, has about a billion available themes and has a very active development community. I was able to find plugins to <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/clean-archives-reloaded/">replicate DasBlog's archive page</a> as well as <a href="http://www.emmanuelgeorjon.com/en/plugin-eg-archives-1745/">archive widget</a> that replicated custom functionality that I added to DasBlog via <a href="http://dasblog.info/CreatingCustomMacrosForDasBlog.aspx">custom macros</a>.

Of course, moving eight years worth of posts to a new engine took quite a bit of effort and planning. I wanted to make sure that I maintained all my posts and comments as well as take advantage of some of the new features available to me from WordPress. For example, I took the opportunity to flatten my list of categories and move most of them to be tags. I also went thru and converted all of my old code snippets to use <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter</a> instead of <a href="http://codehtmler.codeplex.com/releases/view/9505">CodeHTMLer</a> or <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/04/05/pygments-for-windows-live-writer/">Pygments for WL Writer</a>. Of course, I automated almost all of the conversion process. For anyone interested in following my footsteps, I <a href="https://bitbucket.org/devhawk/dasblog-wxr-convert">published my PowerShell scripts</a> for converting DasBlog to the <a href="http://ipggi.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/the-wordpress-extended-rss-wxr-exportimport-xml-document-format-decoded-and-explained/">WordPress WXR import/export format</a> up on BitBucket.

Not only did I want to save all my data, I also wanted to make sure I saved my search engine mojo (if I have any left after blogging a paltry six times in the past sixteen months). So I hacked up a WordPress plugin to redirect my old DasBlog links to the new WordPress URLs. That's <a href="https://bitbucket.org/devhawk/devhawk-redirect">up on BitBucket as well</a> for anyone who wants it. It's got some DevHawk specific bits in there (like the category cleanup) but if you tore those parts out it would be usable for any DasBlog-to-WordPress conversion. If there's interest, maybe I'll write up how the conversion scripts and redirect plugin work.

The plan is that now that I'm finally done moving my blog over the new back end, I will actually start writing on a more regular basis again. We'll see how that works out.
