It has certainly been a huge thrill for me, getting a chance to be a part of the day one keynote and <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2014\/04\/02\/blood-sweat-code\/\">getting 15 minutes of fame<\/a>. However, as the conference winds down I wanted to pull together a summary of the stuff Microsoft announced that relates to enterprise app development and Windows 8.1 Update. I mean, it wasn&#8217;t all about my wardrobe choices\u2026<\/p>\n<p>The Windows for Business blog as a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.windows.com\/windows\/b\/business\/archive\/2014\/04\/02\/building-the-mobile-workplace-with-windows-and-windows-phone.aspx\">good summary post<\/a> that hits the highlights. The stuff I wanted to specifically call out is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We&#8217;ve changed the policy to allow side loaded apps to communicate with desktop apps. Literally every single enterprise customer, Microsoft dev consultant and enterprise technical sales rep I&#8217;ve spoken to in the last year has asked for this.<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve added a feature in Windows 8.1 Update to enable side loaded apps to run code outside of the App Container. This opens up side loaded apps to access the full power of Windows as well as all the existing code the enterprise may have in its portfolio<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve made it significantly easier to get side load rights. I&#8217;d go thru the specifics here, but Rocky Lhotka (who has been *very* vocal about the issues in this space) had a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lhotka.net\/weblog\/Windows8SideLoadingImprovements.aspx\">great summary<\/a>: &#8220;For a maximum of around $100 virtually every organization (small to huge) can get a side loading unlock key for all their devices.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you want more information on how to take advantage of these new features for side loaded apps, here are some resources for you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to my 5 minutes in the keynote, I did a <a href=\"http:\/\/channel9.msdn.com\/Events\/Build\/2014\/2-515\">whole session<\/a> where I drilled into more details on that demo. I also demos that used network loopback for interprocess communication.<\/li>\n<li>John Vintzel and Cliff Strom had a session on <a href=\"http:\/\/channel9.msdn.com\/Events\/Build\/2014\/2-524\">deploying enterprise apps<\/a>. As of this writing, the video isn&#8217;t online yet but it will be within a day or two at that URL.<\/li>\n<li>We have published whitepapers on both <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/windows\/apps\/dn630195.aspx\">Brokered WinRT Components<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/windows\/apps\/dn640582.aspx\">using network loopback in WinRT apps<\/a>\u00a0that go into more details on how to build solutions with this technology<\/li>\n<li>Last but not least, we have a set of <a href=\"http:\/\/code.msdn.microsoft.com\/site\/search?f%5B0%5D.Type=Topic&amp;f%5B0%5D.Value=Sideloading&amp;f%5B0%5D.Text=Sideloading\">samples of sideloaded WinRT apps<\/a>. This includes the keynote demo, another brokered component demo and the WCF &amp; ASP.NET network loopback demos I did in my session. Note, the <a href=\"http:\/\/code.msdn.microsoft.com\/Northwind-Brokered-WinRTC-5143a67c\">keynote demo sample<\/a> is packaged oddly because of the way MSDN&#8217;s sample repo handles (or in this case doesn&#8217;t handle) VS solutions with multiple projects. When I get back to Redmond, I&#8217;m\u00a0 going to see if there&#8217;s a better way to get this sample hosted.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I heard many times over the past two days from folks in person at the conference and via email, twitter, facebook, carrier pigeon, etc just how excited they are about these changes &amp; features. As an engineer who spends most of his days in his office and or in meetings building this stuff, it is amazingly gratifying to hear directly from our users how much our work can help them.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Wow, it&#8217;s been a whirlwind couple of days down here in San Francisco @ Build 2014.
