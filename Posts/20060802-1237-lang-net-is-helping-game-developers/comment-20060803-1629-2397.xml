  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, I pulled the trigger a little too quickly there.  

There are some language tweaks that the Spec# folk put into the C# language (for example) to make it easier to assert that a reference is not allowed to be null, that sort of thing.  There are probably decorations that would not require fudging with the language, and then there might be some sugar to make the decorations less painful.  But basically, the main work and the game of verifying the assertions is accomplished with an integration into the IDE.]]></wp:comment_content>
