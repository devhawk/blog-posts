  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm not sure I believe that Palin will have the sense to wait for 2016 -- if she runs in 2012 I would expect her to go down in flames, although of course it depends on how the Obama administration fares.  As you say, he ran an unbelievably well-organized campaign in two difficult elections, so I'm optimistic.

I'm guessing the Republicans' best hope in 2016 is Bobby Jindal, but they won't go for it.

As for the Democrats, I imagine you're right about "the next Obama" emerging later.  People have pointed at Newark mayor Cory Booker.  Not that the next Obama needs to be black.  A woman would of course be great.  

Your anonymous correspondent above doesn't necessarily deserve to be rebutted point-by-point, but I do think the idea that Senators can't be two-term presidents is nonsense.  The only Senator to be elected to the Presidency in the modern era was JFK, and I think he would certainly have been reelected had he survived his first term.  Besides, Truman was a Senator, and essentially served two terms as President (having assumed the Presidency after only a few weeks as VP).
