  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[@BigJ You're entitled to your own predicitions, though I think you're off your rocker. Tell you what, why don't you put your real name on your prediction so we can circle back in four years and see who was right?

@Julie Yeah, I wish for a better representative of your "team" than Palin as well. 

BTW, to be clear I don't think Palin can "learn the things she needs to to lead" in 8 years or a lifetime for that matter - leadership is one of those things you have or you don't. Not to say she doesn't have it - I haven't seen enough of her to make a decision one way or the other. Certainly, she can excite the Republican base, but that's not leadership. Furthermore, it remains to be seen if she can appeal to voters outside the wack-job core. ]]></wp:comment_content>
