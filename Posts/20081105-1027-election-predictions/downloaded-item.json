Probably, but I\u2019ve got a few thoughts anyway.<\/p>\n<p>First, if Obama runs his presidency like he ran his candidacy, he\u2019ll be a great president and will win reelection in a cakewalk. Obviously, there are *huge* challenges ahead, but I have faith his administration will be able to handle them. <\/p>\n<p>Second, assuming prediction #1 pans out, we\u2019ll see another wide open race in 2016. I\u2019m a big Joe Biden fan, but he\u2019ll be 74 in 2016 \u2013 two years older than McCain is now. No way he runs. Hillary Clinton will 69 so I don\u2019t see her running either. Well, maybe they run but I doubt they\u2019d win the nomination. I\u2019m guessing the Democratic nominee in 2016 will be someone who\u2019s not top of mind today \u2013 someone who emerges in the next two or four years as \u201cthe next Obama\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Third, we haven\u2019t seen the last of Sarah Palin. I\u2019ve been extremely critical of her, but my libertarian friend recommended I not underestimate her. So I won\u2019t. I think she\u2019ll be the Republican nominee for president in 2016. I know folks are talking about her for 2012, but I think she\u2019d rather take her chances in a wide open race in 2016 than go up against Obama a second time. She\u2019s only 44 now, so she\u2019ll be 52 in 2016 \u2013 about perfect for a presidential candidate. Eight years is a long time for her to close the unqualified gap. <\/p>\n<p>In fact, I\u2019d say Ted Stevens <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/ELECTION\/2008\/results\/individual\/#mapSAK\">apparent reelection<\/a> is a likely silver lining in otherwise crappy election for the Republicans. Ted Stevens was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/washington\/AP-StevensTrial.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">found guilty on felony corruption charges<\/a> and faces <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rollcall.com\/news\/29690-1.html\">expulsion from the senate<\/a>, regardless of his apparent victory yesterday. If he is expelled, there would be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adn.com\/ted-stevens\/story\/569836.html\">a special election<\/a> to decide his successor. You have to assume Mark Begich, Stevens\u2019 Democratic challenger, would handily win that special election. But what if Palin ran against Begich? She\u2019s taken a hit it her approval ratings since joining the VP ticket, but she\u2019s still very popular in Alaska and probably liked best by Stevens\u2019 supporters. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a shoo-in, but I believe she\u2019d have a very good chance to win a special election.<\/p>\n<p>Being a senator for eight years would be long enough to shore up the concerns about her qualifications but short enough not to have much of an attackable voting record. She\u2019d have to win reelection in 2014, but given that Stevens has won seven elections in a row dating back to 1970, I\u2019m guessing getting reelected in 2014 would be no problem. <\/p>\n<p>So my predictions are a fairly easy Obama reelection in 2012, followed by Sen Palin (R) vs. \u201cThe Next Obama\u201d (D) in 2016. Midterms in 2010 will probably see Dems give back some of their recent gains, but not enough to lose control of either house of Congress. 2014 is to far out to predict, much less who wins in 2016. But looking at voting trends among minorities, party ID advantages, etc, I like Democrats chances for the foreseeable future. <\/p>\n<p>Finally, I wonder if this is the \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/comment\/columnists\/andrew_sullivan\/article5013891.ece\">end of identity politics<\/a>\u201d as some have suggested. One election is not a trend, so I tend to think that Obama was immune to such attacks more than those attacks no longer viable. We may need to wait until 2016 to find out. When Palin does run again, will she still be a pitbull with lipstick? I like to think identity politics is toast, but I\u2019m guessing the Republicans will go back to that well a few more times before giving up on it. Democrats, on the other hand, have all the proof they need that they can win against identity politics: President-Elect Obama.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Is it to early to start making predictions about 2010, 2012 and beyond yet?
