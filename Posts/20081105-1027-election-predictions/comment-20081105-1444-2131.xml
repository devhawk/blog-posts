  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Very well stated, oh husband of mine.....I am proud of you and your predictions and do not argue with them - except I would truly wish for a better representative of my "team" for the first American Woman President. Though as you state, 8 years or so will give her the opportunity to learn the things she needs to to lead. Here's hoping, when her crowd started chanting her name all I could think of was Eva Peron and I had chills (not the good kind). But underestimate her? How could anyone underestimate her? You never turn your back on the ocean, or a crocodile, or a shark and she is worse them all those :)
