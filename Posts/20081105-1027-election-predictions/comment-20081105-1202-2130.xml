  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The one thing I'll give you is that Gov. Palin will be back, but I do hope it's not through the Senate.  Fortunately for us ;) Senators don't make long lasting Presidents.

Bush, Clinton, Reagan, FDR, Wilson were all two+ term Presidents who came from the Governor's office.  You have to go back to 1837 when the last former Senator finished a 2nd term.  And even then, both Jackson and Monroe were Governors after their Senate service.

Clinton got a pass with the .com bubble, a weakend Russia and Mr. Newt.  Obama faces a world more like 1976 and we know what happened to Carter.  

Some tickets I think will handly beat OB'12, Palin-Crist, Jindal-Crist, Romney-Huckabee, Romney-Pawlenty, Palin-Fiorina.

Oh, this is funny, we'll have Barack Obama & Biden, BOB, in the Whitehouse.  Snicker, snicker.]]></wp:comment_content>
