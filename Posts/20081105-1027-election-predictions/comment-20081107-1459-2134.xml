  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My point was simply that history is not on his side for re-election.  15 former Senators have been elected Presisident.  Of these, only 3 won a second term.  Of those 3, two were also previously governors.

The only Senator to win a second term without a governorship is...drumroll please...Richard Nixon.

Just to clarify, 5 modern (since 1900 at least) Senators have won an election: Nixon, LBJ, JFK, Truman and Harding.

Larger point being that I believe Governors make better Presidents.  Yes, McCain was in the same boat.

I apologize for the pseudonym.  It won't happen again.]]></wp:comment_content>
