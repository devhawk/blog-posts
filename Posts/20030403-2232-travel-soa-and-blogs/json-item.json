And w\/o high speed access for half of it! But I spent much of my time talking about Services Oriented Architecture.

So I&#8217;m starting work on a new <a href=\"presentations.aspx\"> deck<\/a> which evolves my <a href=\"presentations\/net_vision.ppt\">.NET Vision presentation<\/a> (that I have been delivering for over 2 years now) into something more related to SOA. <\/p>\n<p>Of course, this whole &#8220;day job&#8221; thing means I&#8217;ll have less time for upgrading my <a href=\"PermaLink.aspx?guid=6a7eecb5-9ba3-4322-88ac-158d821797c9\">blog infrastructure<\/a>.
