<p>Finally home from being on the road all week. And w/o high speed access for half of it! But I spent much of my time talking about Services Oriented Architecture. I think figured out how I want to talk about it since last <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=d0ab4a4e-c508-4407-a7c0-c4cb9a84d154">Tuesday</a>. So I'm starting work on a new <a href="presentations.aspx"> deck</a> which evolves my <a href="presentations/net_vision.ppt">.NET Vision presentation</a> (that I have been delivering for over 2 years now) into something more related to SOA. </p><p>Of course, this whole "day job" thing means I'll have less time for upgrading my <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=6a7eecb5-9ba3-4322-88ac-158d821797c9">blog infrastructure</a>. So I decided to join <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/"> Chris Andersons</a>' <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=ddc98753-6559-489b-a533-57034790a93a"> BlogX workspace</a>. Would there be any interest in a <a href="prj_webskin.aspx">Site Skinned</a> web front end? Unfortunately, that means scraping some of my past few days experimentation. I was playing around with <a href="http://www.garret.ru/~knizhnik/">Konstantin Knizhnik's</a><a href="http://www.garret.ru/~knizhnik/perst.html">PERST Embedded OODBMS</a><a href="http://www.garret.ru/~knizhnik/Perst.NET/doc/perst.html">for C#</a>. Sort of cool - but I'd like to see something more XML focused - perhaps a lightweight embedded XML storage engine (that's XPath enabled of course).</p>
