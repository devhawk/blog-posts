Finally home from being on the road all week. And w/o high speed access
for half of it! But I spent much of my time talking about Services
Oriented Architecture. I think figured out how I want to talk about it
since last
[Tuesday](http://devhawk.net/2003/03/25/service-oriented-architecture-presenation/). So
I’m starting work on a new [deck](presentations.aspx) which evolves my
[.NET Vision presentation](presentations/net_vision.ppt) (that I have
been delivering for over 2 years now) into something more related to
SOA.

Of course, this whole “day job” thing means I’ll have less time for
upgrading my [blog
infrastructure](http://devhawk.net/2003/04/01/blog-specs/).
So I decided to join [Chris Andersons](http://www.simplegeek.com/)‘
[BlogX
workspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=ddc98753-6559-489b-a533-57034790a93a).
Would there be any interest in a [Site Skinned](prj_webskin.aspx) web
front end? Unfortunately, that means scraping some of my past few days
experimentation. I was playing around with [Konstantin
Knizhnik’s](http://www.garret.ru/~knizhnik/) [PERST Embedded
OODBMS](http://www.garret.ru/~knizhnik/perst.html) [for
C\#](http://www.garret.ru/~knizhnik/Perst.NET/doc/perst.html). Sort of
cool – but I’d like to see something more XML focused – perhaps a
lightweight embedded XML storage engine (that’s XPath enabled of
course).
