  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You seem to be a touch misinformed there. Bush inherited a recession but when he mentioned it he got thrashed by the media. The policies of the Bush administration kept our great country safe and for that I applaud him. We were at war before Bush even took office, but we were simply to naive to realize it. He cared less about his poll numbers and appeasing a hateful media and more about doing what was right and being a man of honor and dignity. As a former soldier and current intelligence professional, I can say with all honesty that President Bush was a great president and THE president that we needed during his 8 years. This election was handed to Obama on a silver platter and he nearly managed to drop it despite that fact. However, if President Obama can be half the man that Bush was and is, he will do quite well and the country will be well served.
