<p>A few random thoughts on yesterday:</p>
<p>Though some in the progressive blogosphere disagree, I thought <a href="http://www.pic2009.org/blog/entry/president_obamas_inaugural_address/">Obama&#8217;s inaugural speech</a> was very good. His start, contrasting taking the oath of office &#8220;during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace&#8221; (as now-former President Bush did [1]) versus taking the oath as he does &#8220;amidst gathering clouds and raging storms&#8221; really set the tone for the whole speech. With Bush sitting right there &#8211; mere feet from the podium &#8211; Obama categorically rejected almost every policy of the Bush administration. When they cut to a shot of Bush in the middle, he didn&#8217;t seem to be enjoying Obama&#8217;s speech very much. In a way, I was reminded of Steven Colbert&#8217;s <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-869183917758574879">epic performance</a> at the White House Correspondents Dinner a few years ago. Of course, the difference was that Colbert was speaking truth *to* power while Obama is speaking truth *from* power. </p>
<p>Speaking of Ex-President Bush (man, <a href="http://twitter.com/DevHawk/status/1134079689">I love writing that</a>) I can say a lot of negative things about him, but I will grudgingly commend him on handling the transition. However, it does feel like it&#8217;s grading him on a massive curve: &#8220;Sure he&#8217;s been an abysmal president, but at least he was able to peacefully hand over the reigns of power without fucking that up too.&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt sorry for <a href="http://www.pic2009.org/blog/entry/elizabeth_alexander_inaugural_profile/">Elizabeth Alexander</a>, the poet who had to speak after President Obama&#8217;s inaugural speech. Everyone started heading for the exits after Obama was done. I hope those early exiters could hear Reverend Lowery&#8217;s benediction, it <a href="http://usatoday.com/communities/religion/post/2009/01/61651854/1?imw=Y">was awesome</a>. I realize Reverend Warren was a controversial pick to deliver the invocation &#8211; certainly, I&#8217;m not a fan &#8211; but I respect Obama for being inclusive of all-viewpoints. And while having a quartet with the likes of Itzhak Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma was awesome, I especially liked John Williams&#8217; inaugural piece &#8220;Air and Simple Gifts&#8221;. But wouldn&#8217;t the theme to Superman have been more appropriate? <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group1212" alt=":)"> </p>
<p>Finally, I skipped the rest of the pre and post inauguration analysis and commentary other than the Countdown podcast which I listen to on my way to work most days. Frankly, I didn&#8217;t need to be reminded of what an historic day it was. Res ipsa loquitur. </p>
