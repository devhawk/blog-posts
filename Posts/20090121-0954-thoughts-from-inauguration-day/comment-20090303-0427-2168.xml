  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Harry, you are an ignorant if you think Bush was a bad president. Most of the problems were caused by the fact that the Dems blocked Bush at every turn. The dems held up regulations to fix Fannie and Freddie. The dems blocked drilling for oil, and then blame Bush for high oil prices. Why is health care expensive? Because dems block tort reform, and push for government solutions rather than free market solutions.

Check out George Orwell because you are putty in the hands of the media. They said Reagan was a bad president (but now have changed their opinion), and Clinton was a great president (who did nothing). Obama has been on the cover of Time magazine 17 times in one year -- I guess you got the message like a loyal robot.

Obama's done nothing his entire career -- would you make an intern the next CEO of Microsoft?

How's the economy going? The good thing about democracy is that we get to live with the choices we make. It makes for a smarter electorate, over time.]]></wp:comment_content>
