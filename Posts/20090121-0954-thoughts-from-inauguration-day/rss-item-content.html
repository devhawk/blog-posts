<p>A few random thoughts on yesterday:</p><p>Though some in the progressive blogosphere disagree, I thought <a href="http://www.pic2009.org/blog/entry/president_obamas_inaugural_address/">Obama’s inaugural speech</a> was very good. His start, contrasting taking the oath of office “during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace” (as now-former President Bush did [1]) versus taking the oath as he does “amidst gathering clouds and raging storms” really set the tone for the whole speech. With Bush sitting right there – mere feet from the podium – Obama categorically rejected almost every policy of the Bush administration. When they cut to a shot of Bush in the middle, he didn’t seem to be enjoying Obama’s speech very much. In a way, I was reminded of Steven Colbert’s <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-869183917758574879">epic performance</a> at the White House Correspondents Dinner a few years ago. Of course, the difference was that Colbert was speaking truth *to* power while Obama is speaking truth *from* power. </p><p>Speaking of Ex-President Bush (man, <a href="http://twitter.com/DevHawk/status/1134079689">I love writing that</a>) I can say a lot of negative things about him, but I will grudgingly commend him on handling the transition. However, it does feel like it’s grading him on a massive curve: “Sure he’s been an abysmal president, but at least he was able to peacefully hand over the reigns of power without fucking that up too.”</p><p>I felt sorry for <a href="http://www.pic2009.org/blog/entry/elizabeth_alexander_inaugural_profile/">Elizabeth Alexander</a>, the poet who had to speak after President Obama’s inaugural speech. Everyone started heading for the exits after Obama was done. I hope those early exiters could hear Reverend Lowery’s benediction, it <a href="http://usatoday.com/communities/religion/post/2009/01/61651854/1?imw=Y">was awesome</a>. I realize Reverend Warren was a controversial pick to deliver the invocation – certainly, I’m not a fan – but I respect Obama for being inclusive of all-viewpoints. And while having a quartet with the likes of Itzhak Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma was awesome, I especially liked John Williams’ inaugural piece “Air and Simple Gifts”. But wouldn’t the theme to Superman have been more appropriate? :)</p><p>Finally, I skipped the rest of the pre and post inauguration analysis and commentary other than the Countdown podcast which I listen to on my way to work most days. Frankly, I didn’t need to be reminded of what an historic day it was. Res ipsa loquitur. </p><hr /><p>[1] The Onion was disturbingly prescient with <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">their article</a> eight years ago “Bush: 'Our Long National Nightmare Of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over'”</p>
