<p>Neither SharpReader nor RSS Bandit renders my business card nicely. They both strip out or otherwise deactivate the CSS tags that are used in rendering the card. So go <a href="PermaLink.aspx?guid=ed18a54c-d8dd-4a81-80be-e5e976de78ba">my web site</a> if you want to see the card &#8220;for real&#8221;.</p>
<p>Raises an interesting question. How much support should syndication feeds like RSS have for look and feel?</p>
