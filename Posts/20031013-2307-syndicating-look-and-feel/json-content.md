Neither SharpReader nor RSS Bandit renders my business card nicely. They
both strip out or otherwise deactivate the CSS tags that are used in
rendering the card. So go [my web
site](PermaLink.aspx?guid=ed18a54c-d8dd-4a81-80be-e5e976de78ba) if you
want to see the card “for real”.

Raises an interesting question. How much support should syndication
feeds like RSS have for look and feel?
