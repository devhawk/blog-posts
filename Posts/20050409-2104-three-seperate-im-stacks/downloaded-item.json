I have a personal IM account (harrypierson at hotmail dot com) on MSN running the newly\u00a0released <a href=\"http:\/\/messenger.msn.com\/\">MSN 7<\/a>.\u00a0I really like the integration with Spaces, the contact cards and the new Personal Message feature that also integrates w\/ WMP and iTunes to show &#8220;what I&#8217;m listening to&#8221; (in case you&#8217;re curious, baby lullabies &#8211; I&#8217;m sitting in Patrick&#8217;s room as he goes to sleep). I hadn&#8217;t realized how many of my coworkers (primarily ex-teammates) have started blogs on MSN Spaces. <\/p>\n<p>I also just installed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/office\/rtc\/client.mspx\">Office Communicator 2005<\/a>, the new corporate client for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/office\/livecomm\/prodinfo\/default.mspx\">Live Communications Server 2005<\/a>. While we&#8217;ve had LCS installed internally for a while, I rarely used it. I mean, the only real value I saw in corporate IM in general was security &#8211; if your employees are chatting on IM, better to keep it off the public Internet. But w\/ LCS 2005 &amp; new new client, there are several cool new features. First off, LCS 2005 connects with both AOL and MSN <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/office\/livecomm\/prodinfo\/publicim.mspx\">public IM services<\/a>. So if you want to, add me as an IM\u00a0contact via my corporate email address (hpierson at microsoft dot com). Next, LCS 2005 &amp; the new client integrate with your Exchange calendar. So if you&#8217;re in a meeting, you&#8217;re status changes to Busy. I can also hover on a contact and see what they&#8217;re up to now (in a meeting until noon, free until 3:30, etc). Finally, the new Office Communicator client integrates with PBX systems. So I can select a conact, hit call, and my desktop phone automatically calls the person. For incoming calls, I get notification even if I&#8217;m not in my office. So if I&#8217;m in a meeting, my wife calls, I can click on the notification to forward the call to my mobile phone. <\/p>\n<p>Finally, I&#8217;m running <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skype.com\/\">Skype<\/a>\u00a0(callto harrypierson). I was in Barcelona most of last week and I used the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skype.com\/products\/skypeout\/\">SkypeOut service<\/a> all the time, except when I was making connections in the Amsterdam airport. I racked up the big 2 Euros in calls over the course of a week. I seem to remember MSN IM having support a similar service via Net2Phone, but they stopped some time ago. I&#8217;d probably can Skype if they brought it back. I don&#8217;t want or need three contact points like this. Two is good &#8211; one for work and one for personal &#8211; but three is one too many. <\/p>\n<p>If you want to reach me, you have zero excuse!\u00a0<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how consumer and corporate IM have finally started to evolve in different directions.
