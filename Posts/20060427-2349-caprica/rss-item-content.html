<p>Battlestar Galactica is already one of the two best shows on TV in my opinion. Lost is one of the best shows ever, but I digress. Now comes news that their doing a <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&amp;id=35773">prequel spinoff</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>SCI FI Channel announced the development of <i>Caprica</i>, a spinoff prequel of its hit <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/" target="outside"><i>Battlestar Galactica</i></a>, in presentations to advertisers in New York on April 26. <i>Caprica</i> would come from <i>Galactica</i> executive producers Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, writer Remi Aubuchon (<i>24</i>) and NBC Universal Television Studio. <br /><br /><i>Caprica</i> would take place more than half a century before the events that play out in <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>. The people of the Twelve Colonies are at peace and living in a society not unlike our own, but where high technology has changed the lives of virtually everyone for the better. <br /><br />But a startling breakthrough in robotics is about to occur, one that will bring to life the age-old dream of marrying artificial intelligence with a mechanical body to create the first living robot: a Cylon. Following the lives of two families, the Graystones and the Adamas (the family of William Adama, who will one day become the commander of the <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>), <i>Caprica</i> will weave together corporate intrigue, techno-action and sexual politics into television's first science fiction family saga, the channel announced. </p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">OK, Comcast officially needs to get <a href="http://www.universalhd.com/">Universal HD</a> so I can see this &amp; BSG in HD.</p>
