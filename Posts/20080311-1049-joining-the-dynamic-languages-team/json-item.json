In a couple of weeks, I&#8217;ll be joining the Dynamic Languages team as a program manager. This is the team who ships <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/IronPython\">IronPython<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ironruby.com\/\">IronRuby<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/hugunin\/archive\/2007\/04\/30\/a-dynamic-language-runtime-dlr.aspx\">Dynamic Language Runtime<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/dynamicsilverlight.net\/\">Dynamic Silverlight<\/a>. After seeing all the their cool work <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/01\/31\/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx\">at Lang.NET this year<\/a>, I just had to be a part of it. <\/p>\n<p>As you might imagine, I&#8217;m pretty excited about this opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>In the short term, I&#8217;ll be primarily focused on IronPython, which is marching towards their 2.0 release. Towards that end, I&#8217;m attending <a href=\"http:\/\/us.pycon.org\/2008\/about\/\">PyCon 2008<\/a> in Chicago this weekend, though I don&#8217;t officially change jobs for a couple more weeks. Longer term&#8230;well let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m going to be really focused on doing my part to get IPy 2.0 out the door and after that we&#8217;ll see where things lie. This is a pretty big shift for me, so I&#8217;m explicitly trying to focus on short term work for the first six months in order to absorb as much knowledge as possible from the folks I&#8217;ll be working with like <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/hugunin\/default.aspx\">Jim Hugunin<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iunknown.com\/\">John Lam<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/mmaly\/\">Martin Maly<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/jimmy.schementi.com\/blog\/\">Jimmy Schementi<\/a> and a bunch of others who I haven&#8217;t met yet.<\/p>\n<p>While this is a pretty big role shift, I haven&#8217;t given up my passion for services and\/or architecture. In other words, this isn&#8217;t the last you&#8217;ll hear about <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/03\/05\/Kitchen+Sink+Variability.aspx\">Kitchen Sink Variability<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/03\/03\/What+Is+The+ROI+On+EA.aspx\">the ROI of EA<\/a> or my perspective on Nick&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/01\/22\/Nicks+Flawed+Vision+Of+A+Shared+Integration+Model.aspx\">Shared Integration Model<\/a>. Obviously, with the job focus change, I expect focus on my blog to change as well. I&#8217;m not exactly sure how blogging fits into this new role, though the Dynamic Languages team is pretty open and many other members blog (as linked above) so I doubt I&#8217;m going anywhere. I&#8217;m going to try and keep blogging Morning Coffee, but I&#8217;m guessing it won&#8217;t be quite as regular as it has been in the past. Unfortunately, I am going to stop coding <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/CategoryView,category,F%23.aspx\">F#<\/a> for a while (sorry, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dsyme\/\">Don<\/a>!) I can&#8217;t focus on learning two languages at once and obviously Python is my new top priority. <\/p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t in my MSIT architect role that long, but I feel that the &#8220;in the trenches&#8221; experience will serve me greatly for years to come. And of course, I will miss my teammates, especially <a href=\"http:\/\/halfmybrain.spaces.live.com\/\">Dale<\/a>\u00a0 who regular readers might remember from <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/02\/22\/Morning+Doughnuts+5.aspx\">filling in around here<\/a> occasionally. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>After nearly two years in MSIT and six years focused on architecture across three different roles, I&#8217;m moving on to a new job in the Developer Division.
