<p>I&#8217;m digging the new <a href="http://domains.live.com/">Custom Domains</a> service from <a href="http://www.live.com/">Windows Live</a>. Setup couldn&#8217;t have been smoother:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign up on Custom Domains</li>
<li>Change the MX record of my domain</li>
<li>Add Users</li>
</ul>
<p>The only even slightly tricky point is that I had set up a passport for <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net">harry@devhawk.net</a> in the distant past and long forgotten the password. However, Custom Domains allows be to &#8220;evict&#8221; a user from the domain so I was able to recreate it with little trouble.</p>
<p>I do have two feature requests that I&#8217;m guessing are on the horizon for the <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/customdomains/">Custom Domains team</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aliases: I&#8217;d like to set up &#8220;<a href="mailto:webmaster@devhawk.net">webmaster@devhawk.net</a>&#8221; to simply forward to my main devhawk email. This is a pretty common feature of other email systems, so I expect some future release will include this.</li>
<li>Non-Web Client Access: I can use Outlook to access my personal hotmail account, but I had issues accessing my devhawk email. </li>
</ul>
