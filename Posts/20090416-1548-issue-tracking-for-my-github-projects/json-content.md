FYI, anyone using [ipydbg](http://github.com/devhawk/ipydbg/),
[devhawk\_ipy](http://github.com/devhawk/devhawk_ipy) or [Pygments for
WL Writer](http://github.com/devhawk/pygments.wlwriter) can now submit
issues, bugs and feature requests other the associated GitHub project
page. Head to the associated GitHub project page and click the “Issues”
tab at the top. There’s a short video of introducing the [GitHub

check out.

BTW, thanks to [defunkt](http://github.com/defunkt) @ GitHub for the
