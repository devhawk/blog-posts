So I was supposed to have a new mobile phone by now. I spoke to the
sales rep for my wireless provider Monday who had to convince the
customer care department that they needed to give me a shiny nice new
phone to make up for all the crap I’ve put up with for the past six
months. Maybe it should be called customer we-don’t-care. Anyway, they
finally agreed and I was supposed to have a new phone yesterday. Except
that it didn’t arrive. My bill arrived no problem, so they obviously
have the right address. I call the rep, and he’s not available.

The only thing keeping me with this provider (for now) is that it will
suck just as bad with every other provider anyway. What a crappy
business model: “We suck slightly less than everyone else”. Maybe it
should be their advertising slogan. Let’s put it on a billboard.
