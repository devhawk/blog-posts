<p>So I was supposed to have a new mobile phone by now. I spoke to the sales rep for my wireless provider Monday who had to convince the customer care department that they needed to give me a shiny nice new phone to make up for all the crap I&#8217;ve put up with for the past six months. Maybe it should be called customer we-don&#8217;t-care. Anyway, they finally agreed and I was supposed to have a new phone yesterday. Except that it didn&#8217;t arrive. My bill arrived no problem, so they obviously have the right address. I call the rep, and he&#8217;s not available.</p>
<p>The only thing keeping me with this provider (for now) is that it will suck just as bad with every other provider anyway. What a crappy business model: &#8220;We suck slightly less than everyone else&#8221;. Maybe it should be their advertising slogan. Let&#8217;s put it on a billboard. </p>
