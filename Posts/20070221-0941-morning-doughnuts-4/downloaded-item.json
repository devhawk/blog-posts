As most of you know Harry and I are doing quite a bit of work with <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/netframework\/aa663324.aspx\">WCF<\/a> so we are interested in this type of advice.  <\/li>\n<li>Our team has been thinking about how to manage a large number of services in an automated fashion. This would include deploying new services, monitoring the services, automatically handling scaling, service discovery, and automated provisioning to name a few possible capabilities. I almost think of it like the next version of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uddi.org\/\">UDDI<\/a>, especially when it comes to provisioning. I think that as systems become more distributed that the ability to automatically manage these systems is going to be key to their success. I know that some thought has already gone on in this area by people far smarter than I, but as I consider how to operate an infrastructure with thousands of services in it it is apparent that the opportunity is there for us to design and implement a system management framework that automates the majority of the tasks. I need to spend some time to consider how the framework would work, and document the capabilities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>According to Reuters surgeons who play video games are more skilled.
