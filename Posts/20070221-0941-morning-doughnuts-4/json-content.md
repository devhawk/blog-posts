-   According to
    [Reuters](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N2J303978.htm)
    surgeons who play video games are more skilled. Remind me to ask the
    doctor if s/he owns an [XBOX 360](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/) the
    next time I am getting operated on.
-   I have reached the [National
    Championship](http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfootball/) game in
    dynasty mode of [NCAA Football
    2007](http://www.easports.com/ncaa07/). The opponent of my [BYU
    Cougars](http://www.byucougars.com/football/)…why that would be
    Harry’s alma mater, the [USC
    Trojans](http://usctrojans.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/usc-m-footbl-body.html).
    Funny how that worked out.
-   Nicholas Allen writes in his
    [blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/default.aspx) about when you
    should use
    [Indigo](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx)
    to write a
    [channel](http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/02/20/when-to-write-a-channel.aspx),
    and more importantly when you should not. As most of you know Harry
    and I are doing quite a bit of work with
    [WCF](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx)
    so we are interested in this type of advice.
-   Our team has been thinking about how to manage a large number of
    services in an automated fashion. This would include deploying new
    services, monitoring the services, automatically handling scaling,
    service discovery, and automated provisioning to name a few possible
    capabilities. I almost think of it like the next version of
    [UDDI](http://www.uddi.org/), especially when it comes to
    provisioning. I think that as systems become more distributed that
    the ability to automatically manage these systems is going to be key
    to their success. I know that some thought has already gone on in
    this area by people far smarter than I, but as I consider how to
    operate an infrastructure with thousands of services in it it is
    apparent that the opportunity is there for us to design and
    implement a system management framework that automates the majority
    of the tasks. I need to spend some time to consider how the
    framework would work, and document the capabilities.
