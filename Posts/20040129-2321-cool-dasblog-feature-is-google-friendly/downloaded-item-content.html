<p>I was reading <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/">Steve&#8217;s</a> blog with my browser earlier today when I noticed his odd permalink url&#8217;s. Instead of a url like &#8220;http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=9abbd5ea-3a10-44d8-8872-877033b7349c&#8221;, his look like &#8220;http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,fc99ce5e-b748-44f0-853d-0a261632b885.aspx&#8221;. Turns out it&#8217;s a standard feature of dasBlog! Just check &#8220;Enable URL rewriting&#8221; in the config page and you&#8217;re set. Now my permalink url&#8217;s look like Steve&#8217;s. </p>
<p>Since Google doesn&#8217;t index pages based on query string, this feature should make my site more easily crawled and googled.</p>
<p>Update: This feature breaks sub category specific feeds, like &#8220;<a href="CategoryView.aspx?category=Blogging%7CdasBlog">Blogging | dasBlog</a>&#8220;, so I&#8217;m turning it back off until someone can fix the bug.</p>
