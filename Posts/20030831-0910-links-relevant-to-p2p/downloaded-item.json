The first is <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/iphlp\/iphlp\/ip_helper_start_page.asp\">IP Helper<\/a>, a library included with XP that &#8220;enables the retrieval and modification of network configuration settings for the local computer&#8221;. I had never seen that library before, but it&#8217;s full of useful methods like <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/iphlp\/iphlp\/getadaptersinfo.asp\">GetAdaptersInfo<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/en-us\/iphlp\/iphlp\/getadaptersaddresses.asp\">GetAdaptersAddresses<\/a>. I want to be able to retrieve the IPv6 address of my NICs directly, so this is the library I need. Anyone out there wrapped it in managed code yet? I was hoping to do this part with WMI, but the IPv6 info doesn&#8217;t seem to be exposed via WMI.<\/p>\n<p>The other relevant link is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?familyid=A949A3DE-990C-468C-86F6-4ABFEC4FFAC6&amp;displaylang=en\">IPv6 Internet Connection Firewall SDK<\/a>, which &#8220;contains all the software required to configure the IPv6 Internet Connection Firewall&#8221;. I assume that means that I can open relevant ports to enable P2P communication. As I <a href=\"PermaLink.aspx?guid=9583d859-dee0-408c-b889-124d97a8ffb9\">wrote yesterday<\/a>, the issue I&#8217;m having with GraphChat is likely related to the IPv6 Firewall configuration. I&#8217;d like to include in my P2P managed library the ability to manage the IPv6 Firewall.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>My contact on the P2P team just gave me two more important links for the construction of IPv6 based P2P apps.
