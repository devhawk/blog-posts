<li>Nick Malik <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/04/11/architecture-is-it-code-or-is-it-data.aspx">wonders</a> if architecture is code or if it&#8217;s data? Frankly, I have nothing to add to this, but thought I should link to something Nick wrote since he&#8217;s letting me share his office for the next few months while I&#8217;m engaged with one of the teams he mentions, though&nbsp;he begged me not to disclose which one. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group933" alt=":)">  </li>

<li>Xbox.com is running a new contest called &#8220;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/mymomsagamer/default.htm">My Mom&#8217;s a Gamer</a>&#8220;. Mine is. These days, it&#8217;s mostly casual games on <a href="http://zone.msn.com/">MSN Games</a>, but back in the day she played both the Atari 2600 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColecoVision">Colecovision</a>. She would play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders#Later_releases">Space Invaders</a> for hours. And curse. A lot. Most kids learned to curse on the playground, I learned from my mother.  </li>
<li>Mark Cuban claims the <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/04/11/the-maturity-of-web-2-0-and-the-hdtv-is-the-pc/">HDTV is the new PC</a>. TV and PC technologies are certainly evolving as they merge, but will that platform be as open as the desktop PC or the browser? It better be. </li>
<li>According to Nick Carr, Citigroup is <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/04/citi_whacks_it.php">looking to cut</a> $4.6<em> billion</em> in spending over the next three years and that IT will be one of the &#8220;cornerstones&#8221; (i.e. hardest hit) of that effort. I had a chat with an Meta analyst in Australia a few years ago who suggested that IT spending was going to go thru an innovator&#8217;s dilemma phase. Huge companies (like Citi) with huge IT budgets are facing significant competition from small companies that can&#8217;t afford huge IT budgets. These smaller companies get used to running a tighter ship and tend to be more competitive as they grow and are able to directly face off against the big fish. </li>
