    [wonders](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/04/11/architecture-is-it-code-or-is-it-data.aspx)
    if architecture is code or if it’s data? Frankly, I have nothing to
    add to this, but thought I should link to something Nick wrote since
    he’s letting me share his office for the next few months while I’m
    engaged with one of the teams he mentions, though he begged me not
    to disclose which one.

-   Ted Neward’s [Five Minute Management Lessons for
    Developers](http://blogs.tedneward.com/PermaLink,guid,9bb6f310-ad61-4893-b1a2-0bd538ea5988.aspx)
    made me snicker.
-   Xbox.com is running a new contest called “[My Mom’s a
    Gamer](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/mymomsagamer/default.htm)“.
    Mine is. These days, it’s mostly casual games on [MSN
    Games](http://zone.msn.com/), but back in the day she played both
    the Atari 2600 and
    [Colecovision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColecoVision). She would
    play [Space
    Invaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders#Later_releases)
    for hours. And curse. A lot. Most kids learned to curse on the
    playground, I learned from my mother.
-   Mark Cuban claims the [HDTV is the new
    PC](http://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/04/11/the-maturity-of-web-2-0-and-the-hdtv-is-the-pc/).
    TV and PC technologies are certainly evolving as they merge, but
    will that platform be as open as the desktop PC or the browser? It
    better be.
-   According to Nick Carr, Citigroup is [looking to
    cut](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/04/citi_whacks_it.php)
    \$4.6 *billion* in spending over the next three years and that IT
    will be one of the “cornerstones” (i.e. hardest hit) of that effort.
    I had a chat with an Meta analyst in Australia a few years ago who
    suggested that IT spending was going to go thru an innovator’s
    dilemma phase. Huge companies (like Citi) with huge IT budgets are
    facing significant competition from small companies that can’t
    afford huge IT budgets. These smaller companies get used to running
    a tighter ship and tend to be more competitive as they grow and are
    able to directly face off against the big fish.
