Like alot of other people, I'm stuck trying to get to LA for PDC. PDC + USC/UW game yesterday + fires closing LAX have screwed everything up royally. They just made an announcement for a flight into Ontario that is in final boarding, so maybe that's a good sign that my flight that was supposed to leave 15 minutes ago will go soon. Seen a couple of 'softies, including my boss's boss's boss <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/blogs/ericr/">Eric Rudder</a>. He's on standby for my flight. Thought I saw <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/bmerrill/">Brad Merrill</a> waiting in Alaska Airlines customer service line (which is about 2 miles long).
