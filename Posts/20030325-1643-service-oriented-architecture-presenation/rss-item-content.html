I have to deliver a presentation on "Service-Oriented Architecture" on Thursday. There are a variety of PPTs on the subject floating around MS, but most are internal. My coworker pointed me to one available externally from the <a href="http://www.dotnetmaailma.com/dotnetmaailma/seminaarit/online/EMEA+Architects+Tour.htm"> EMEA Architects Tour</a> which was delivered by <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0108971/">Clemens</a>. There are a variety of other interesting looking sessions on that site, including an AOP w/ .NET attributes session, also by Clemens. Highly recommended.
