He seemed surprised that I took the developer perspective. To quote <a href=\"http:\/\/davidjwhite.net\/myblog\/\">David White<\/a>: &#8220;Architect Must Implement&#8221;. The customization opportunity in guidance automation is huge, but the value is to the developer first. And while it&#8217;s a good start, it doesn&#8217;t go very far at automating the development experience. At heart, I guess I&#8217;m a developer even though my business card sez Architect (with a capital &#8220;A&#8221; these days no less).\n<\/li>\n<li>I moved my laptop over to Vista yesterday.

The only annoyance is my USB smart card reader, which is fine in a pinch but a pain to constantly have dangling off my laptop.
