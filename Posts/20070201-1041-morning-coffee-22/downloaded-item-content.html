<li>I figured out something to build with PowerShell. Not ready to spill all the beans yet, but I&#8217;ve started by building a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714636.aspx">provider</a> for SQL Server. SQL already has the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162169.aspx">SQL Management Objects (SMO)</a>&nbsp;library, so I can really focus on how PowerShell works rather than getting too bogged down in the logic of the provider. I&#8217;m sure someone else is working on something similar, but my primary goal with building this provider is to understand PowerShell. The codebase itself is a distant second in priority.

<li>On the subject of missing LINQ&#8217;s, Alex James wants <a href="http://www.base4.net/Blog.aspx?ID=300">LINQ to Web</a>. A good potential use for the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb251794.aspx">Windows Live Search API</a>.

<li>I posted three recent blog posts to <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/">DotNetKicks</a> yesterday, but&nbsp;I&#8217;ve only collected one additional kick so far (for my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/29/Compiling+Workflows.aspx">Compiling Workflows post</a>). Looking at what does gather kicks, I think I would need to write a more dev focused article if I wanted to make the DNK home page.

<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/donsmith/">Don Smith</a> left a <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,a8ceccf6-df2a-4213-9b87-ef1d46e31516.aspx#commentstart">comment</a> on my WSSF post where he talked about the developer and the architect perspective. He seemed surprised that I took the developer perspective. To quote <a href="http://davidjwhite.net/myblog/">David White</a>: &#8220;Architect Must Implement&#8221;. The customization opportunity in guidance automation is huge, but the value is to the developer first. And while it&#8217;s a good start, it doesn&#8217;t go very far at automating the development experience. At heart, I guess I&#8217;m a developer even though my business card sez Architect (with a capital &#8220;A&#8221; these days no less).

<li>I moved my laptop over to Vista yesterday. My workstation is still on XP, but that&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t had time to completely rebuild my dev environment. No Aero support with the

<li>I elbowed my way into the TS Gateway pilot at Microsoft and I&#8217;m loving it. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/longhorn/terminal-services/default.mspx">TS Gateway</a> is a new feature of Longhorn Server that &#8220;enables authorized remote users to connect to terminal servers and remote desktops on the corporate network from any Internet-connected device running Remote Desktop Connection 6.0.&#8221; So I can quickly and easily remote into my desktop from anywhere without establishing a VPC session. The only annoyance is my USB smart card reader, which is fine in a pinch but a pain to constantly have dangling off my laptop. However, my boss approved a PCMCIA smart card reader so soon that won&#8217;t be an issue.</li>
