There are two hockey franchises for the Xbox 360: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.easports.com\/\">EA Sports<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.2ksports.com\/\">2K Sports<\/a>. I&#8217;ve been a 2K fan for several years, but I didn&#8217;t think much of their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/games\/nhl2k6xbox\/\">last effort<\/a> on Xbox so I never bothered to pick the 360 version. Of course, EA Sports skipped the 360 last year so I&#8217;ve been without next-gen hockey since I bought my next-gen console. <\/p>\n<p>Now there&#8217;s a new version of both major hockey franchises, just in time for the <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nhl\/news\/story?page=2006camps\">opening of training camps<\/a>. Each has had an entire year to innovate, and it&#8217;s interesting to see where each title has spent that time. 2K Sports has created &#8220;Cinemotion&#8221;, which is an entirely new presentation system which is more like an &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/xbox360.ign.com\/articles\/732\/732345p1.html\">interactive hockey movie<\/a>&#8221; than a TV broadcast.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; border-right-width: 0px\" height=\"120\" alt=\"NHL 07 Box\" src=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/devhawk_images\/boxnhl07.jpg\" width=\"85\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" \/>EA Sports spent their time on an entirely new control scheme called &#8220;Skill Stick&#8221;. Basically, while the left thumbstick still controls player movement, the right thumbstick controls the player&#8217;s stick. It&#8217;s taking time to get used to &#8211; hey I&#8217;ve only had the game a few hours &#8211; but so far I really like it. I was playing the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/live\/marketplace\/nhl07\/demo.htm\">XBLM Demo<\/a> and scored on a sweet spinorama move with the skill stick. That pretty much hooked me on the spot. Most of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/games\/platforms\/xbox360\/nhl07#critics\">reviewers<\/a> have singled out the skill stick as the reason for the generally\u00a0favorable reviews.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Plus, EA picked <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtoncaps.com\/\">Washington Capitals<\/a>\u00a0superstar <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtoncaps.com\/team\/player.asp?player_id=17\">Alex Ovechkin<\/a>\u00a0for their cover athlete. Barring awful reviews, I pretty much decided to pickup NHL 07 as soon as I heard that.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>For those who don&#8217;t keep a close eye on my Xbox playing habits, I picked up NHL 07 last night.
