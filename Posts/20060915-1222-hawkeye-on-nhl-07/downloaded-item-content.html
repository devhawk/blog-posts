There are two hockey franchises for the Xbox 360: <a href="http://www.easports.com/">EA Sports</a> and <a href="http://www.2ksports.com/">2K Sports</a>. I&#8217;ve been a 2K fan for several years, but I didn&#8217;t think much of their <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/nhl2k6xbox/">last effort</a> on Xbox so I never bothered to pick the 360 version. Of course, EA Sports skipped the 360 last year so I&#8217;ve been without next-gen hockey since I bought my next-gen console. </p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s a new version of both major hockey franchises, just in time for the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?page=2006camps">opening of training camps</a>. Each has had an entire year to innovate, and it&#8217;s interesting to see where each title has spent that time. 2K Sports has created &#8220;Cinemotion&#8221;, which is an entirely new presentation system which is more like an &#8220;<a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/732/732345p1.html">interactive hockey movie</a>&#8221; than a TV broadcast.</p>

Basically, while the left thumbstick still controls player movement, the right thumbstick controls the player&#8217;s stick. It&#8217;s taking time to get used to &#8211; hey I&#8217;ve only had the game a few hours &#8211; but so far I really like it. I was playing the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/marketplace/nhl07/demo.htm">XBLM Demo</a> and scored on a sweet spinorama move with the skill stick. That pretty much hooked me on the spot. Most of the <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/nhl07#critics">reviewers</a> have singled out the skill stick as the reason for the generally&nbsp;favorable reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, EA picked <a href="http://www.washingtoncaps.com/">Washington Capitals</a>&nbsp;superstar <a href="http://www.washingtoncaps.com/team/player.asp?player_id=17">Alex Ovechkin</a>&nbsp;for their cover athlete. Barring awful reviews, I pretty much decided to pickup NHL 07 as soon as I heard that.</p>
