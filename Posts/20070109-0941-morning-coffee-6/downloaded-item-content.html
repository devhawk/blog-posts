<li>Didn&#8217;t see <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=270080194">that</a>&nbsp;coming. I guess the Buckeyes didn&#8217;t either. Congrats to the Gators. That makes at least three championships in a row won by the underdog. For all the complaining about the <a href="http://www.bcsfootball.org/">BCS</a>, it&#8217;s hard to argue they got the champion wrong this year. However, with the exception of the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls06/bowls?game=fiesta">Fiesta Bowl</a>, the BCS games weren&#8217;t very good this year.  </li>
<li>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://onten.net/Blogs/tina/you-heard-it-people-carbon-is-real/">video</a> of the new <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/ces2007/microsoftintegratesiptvsoftwareplatform.htm">Xbox 360 IPTV</a> service up on <a href="http://onten.net">10</a>. I realize it&#8217;s a demo and we&#8217;re nearly a year away from release, but I&#8217;m not impressed. Xbox 360 Fanboy <a href="http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2007/01/09/rumor-xbox-iptv-may-not-be-so-grand/">pointed to</a> a blogger who got a <a href="http://thunor.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!71C238B5E0E3724D!149.entry">deeper look at the service</a> at Microsoft&#8217;s CE booth. Frankly, it doesn&#8217;t look or sound like it&#8217;s much different than standard cable service (though I like the sound of 35Mbps bandwidth at my house). I realize familiarity is good, but do we really have to lock ourselves into the existing TV paradigm?  </li>
<li>I got roped into a webcast today on <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032321927&EventCategory=4&culture=en-US&CountryCode=US">Optimizing Application Platform Infrastructure</a>. It&#8217;s at 11am Pacific time. Stop by and say hi. </li>
<li>My colleague <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com">Dale</a> has a rant about <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!271.entry">Service Oriented Assholes</a>. His definition: &#8220;Any person or team that&nbsp;pontificates on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) without considering the realities of implementing SOA in a real business environment with real suppliers, customers, and products. These people are great at designing something on a white board or on paper, but couldn&#8217;t produce a real workable production ready system if their life depended on it.&#8221; Sort of a more specific (and vulgar) version of Joel&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">Architecture Astronauts</a>&#8220;. How many SOA-holes do you know?</li>
