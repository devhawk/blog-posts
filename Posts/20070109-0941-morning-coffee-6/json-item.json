For all the complaining about the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bcsfootball.org\/\">BCS<\/a>, it&#8217;s hard to argue they got the champion wrong this year. However, with the exception of the <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/ncf\/bowls06\/bowls?game=fiesta\">Fiesta Bowl<\/a>, the BCS games weren&#8217;t very good this year.  <\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/onten.net\/Blogs\/tina\/you-heard-it-people-carbon-is-real\/\">video<\/a> of the new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-US\/community\/events\/ces2007\/microsoftintegratesiptvsoftwareplatform.htm\">Xbox 360 IPTV<\/a> service up on <a href=\"http:\/\/onten.net\">10<\/a>. I realize it&#8217;s a demo and we&#8217;re nearly a year away from release, but I&#8217;m not impressed.

Frankly, it doesn&#8217;t look or sound like it&#8217;s much different than standard cable service (though I like the sound of 35Mbps bandwidth at my house). I realize familiarity is good, but do we really have to lock ourselves into the existing TV paradigm?  <\/li>\n<li>I got roped into a webcast today on <a href=\"http:\/\/msevents.microsoft.com\/CUI\/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032321927&amp;EventCategory=4&amp;culture=en-US&amp;CountryCode=US\">Optimizing Application Platform Infrastructure<\/a>.

His definition: &#8220;Any person or team that\u00a0pontificates on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) without considering the realities of implementing SOA in a real business environment with real suppliers, customers, and products. These people are great at designing something on a white board or on paper, but couldn&#8217;t produce a real workable production ready system if their life depended on it.&#8221; Sort of a more specific (and vulgar) version of Joel&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.joelonsoftware.com\/articles\/fog0000000018.html\">Architecture Astronauts<\/a>&#8220;.
