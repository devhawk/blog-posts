Saw [Matrix Reloaded](http://www.thematrix.com/) yesterday. Loved it,
but I know I don’t get all of it – quite the mind trip. Reminds me of
how I felt after seeing [Brazil](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0088846) the

reminds me of a conversation I had at the West LA Blockbuster Video
several years ago. I was renting [12
Monkeys](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0114746) (another great [Terry

front of me in line commented that he hated the movie. I quipped that
“It was above the heads of most people”. This guy, not realizing I had
just insulted his intelligence, responded with an enthusiastic “Yeah!”

I think everyone who sees the Matrix Reloaded will fall into one of two
categories – those that don’t get all of it the first time and hate it
and those who don’t get all of it the first time and love it. I’m
curious to see how well this does at the box office in the coming weeks.
It will break all the records this weekend, but does it have “legs”?

At some point will we (as a blog community) declare the spoiler-free
