I downloaded the cool Matrix [animated
wallpaper](http://zmatrix.sf.net/) and [screen
saver](http://www.mvr.us/screen_savers/) that I read about on [Sean
Alexander’s blog](http://erablog.net/blogs/sean). I thought it was
interesting that the animated wallpaper configuration utility has a
“Hire the Developer” menu item that basically was a prose version of his
resume.
