Dare Obasanjo had an [insightful
post](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5b77c81e-f25e-4b26-9040-a414cdd137c8)
on copyright and how it works a few days ago. Typically, I would simply
dump this into my [del.icio.us
favorites](http://del.icio.us/harrypierson) and FeedBurner would
dutifully insert it into my RSS feed. However, I’m calling it out on my
blog proper because I loved this analogy: 

> Pointing out that copyright infringement doesn’t meet some 17th
> century definition of the verb “steal” because the original property
> isn’t changing hands is like arguing that calling your ex-girlfriend a
> slut isn’t libel because you only said it to people over IM.
