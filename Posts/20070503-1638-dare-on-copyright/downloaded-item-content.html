<p>Dare Obasanjo had an <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5b77c81e-f25e-4b26-9040-a414cdd137c8">insightful post</a> on copyright and how it works a few days ago. Typically, I would simply dump this into my <a href="http://del.icio.us/harrypierson">del.icio.us favorites</a> and FeedBurner would dutifully insert it into my RSS feed. However, I&#8217;m calling it out on my blog proper because I loved this analogy:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Pointing out that copyright infringement doesn&#8217;t meet some 17th century definition of the verb &#8220;steal&#8221; because the original property isn&#8217;t changing hands is like arguing that calling your ex-girlfriend a slut isn&#8217;t libel because you only said it to people over IM.</p>
