<p>We&#8217;ve had some technical difficulties around here. <a href="http://conpro.net/">Tom</a> installed ASP.NET 2.0 Beta 1 on this box and it automatically upgraded all the web apps on the machine to the new version. It caused a bunch of issues including breaking the admin interface and requiring a reboot every few hours. I spent some time this afternoon getting all the web apps back on ASP.NET 1.1. I uninstalled all of the beta bits, but it still didn&#8217;t work &#8211; I needed to use the aspnet_regiis utility to completely uninstall the IIS registration and then reinstall. I get the feeling that I could have left the beta bits hanging installed and just used aspnet_regiis to reset the registration, but better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Anyway, since I couldn&#8217;t log in, I obviously couldn&#8217;t blog. I keep an Outlook task folder of &#8220;Shit to Blog&#8221; that&#8217;s gathered a few items, so I&#8217;m looking forward to getting those posted. </p>
