Another option besides ActiveSWF is the recently announced [Xamlon Pro
Flash Edition](http://www.xamlon.com/software/xamlonpro/flash/). Xamlon
is essentially an implementation of XAML the current version of Visual
Studio. There’s a version for [Windows
Forms](http://www.xamlon.com/software/xamlonpro/winforms/), for [Compact
Framework](http://www.xamlon.com/software/xamlonpro/compact/) and now
for Flash. So basically, you can write your flash app with XAML and C\#.
Apparently, you can also [code
directly](http://blog.debreuil.com/archive/2005/02/02/627.aspx) to the
Flash format, bypassing the XAML layer entirely. I like the idea of
using a managed component like Xamlon better than a COM based component.

My big issue with using Flash is that it’s a totally seperate
programming environment from the browser. Using VML in IE, you can
manipulate the vector objects with javascript. In Flash, you may be
doing one thing in the browser and something completely different in the
flash movie. That’s a pain in the behind.
