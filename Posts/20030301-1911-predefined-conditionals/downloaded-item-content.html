<p>Does anyone know of predefined conditional compilation directives for C#? I know VS.NET creates &#8220;DEBUG&#8221; and &#8220;TRACE&#8221;, but I was wondering if there&#8217;s a built-in version conditional? I want to write something like:</p>
<p>#if CLRv1.1<br> &#8230;CLR v1.1 specific code&#8230;<br> #else<br> &#8230;CLR v1.0 specific code&#8230;<br> #endif</p>
