<p>Does anyone know of predefined conditional compilation directives for C#? I know VS.NET creates "DEBUG" and "TRACE", but I was wondering if there's a built-in version conditional? I want to write something like:</p><p>#if CLRv1.1<br /> ...CLR v1.1 specific code...<br /> #else<br /> ...CLR v1.0 specific code...<br /> #endif</p>
