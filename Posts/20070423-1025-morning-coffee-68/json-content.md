-   [My wife](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com) and I celebrated our
    seven year anniversary over the weekend. She rocks. ‘Nuff said.
-   Over the weekend, Gov.Gregoire signed a bill that protecting the
    rights of same-sex couples. It’s not the same as full marriage
    rights (which long time readers know I [fully
    support](http://devhawk.net/2004/02/27/In+Support+Of+Gay+Marriage.aspx))
    but it’s a step in the right direction.
-   I picked up the Xbox 360 [HD DVD
    player](http://www.xbox.com/hardware/xbox360hddvdplayer) over the
    weekend. Rented [Batman
    Begins](http://hddvd.highdefdigest.com/batmanbegins.html) and it
    looks awesome. However, it wasn’t the stunning difference between
    standard and high def TV programming. I wonder if my five year old
    HDTV is showing it’s age.
-   Scott Guthrie continues his LINQ series with a post on the new
    [Query
    Syntax](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/04/21/new-orcas-language-feature-query-syntax.aspx)
    in C\#3/VB9. While this is feature is great for those who are using
    LINQ to SQL, it does force pretty much all LINQ to whatever
    providers to support the from-where-orderby-select pattern. But not
    all query sources want to be limited to that model. For example, if
    you wanted to do a LINQ to Data Warehouse, wouldn’t you want more
    flexibility in your query syntax?
-   I didn’t realize [Steve
    Jones](http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/index.html) had a
    blog. At least, I think this Steve Jones is the Steve Jones that I
    know. But I’m not sure. Either way, it looks good so I subscribed…
