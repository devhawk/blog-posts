<ul><li><a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com">My wife</a> and I celebrated our seven year anniversary over the weekend. She rocks. 'Nuff said. </li><li>Over the weekend, Gov.Gregoire signed a bill that protecting the rights of same-sex couples. It's not the same as full marriage rights (which long time readers know I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/02/27/In+Support+Of+Gay+Marriage.aspx">fully support</a>) but it's a step in the right direction.  </li><li>I picked up the Xbox 360 <a href="http://www.xbox.com/hardware/xbox360hddvdplayer">HD DVD player</a> over the weekend. Rented <a href="http://hddvd.highdefdigest.com/batmanbegins.html">Batman Begins</a> and it looks awesome. However, it wasn't the stunning difference between standard and high def TV programming. I wonder if my five year old HDTV is showing it's age.  </li><li>Scott Guthrie continues his LINQ series with a post on the new <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/04/21/new-orcas-language-feature-query-syntax.aspx">Query Syntax</a> in C#3/VB9. While this is feature is great for those who are using LINQ to SQL, it does force pretty much all LINQ to whatever providers to support the from-where-orderby-select pattern. But not all query sources want to be limited to that model. For example, if you wanted to do a LINQ to Data Warehouse, wouldn't you want more flexibility in your query syntax? </li><li>I didn't realize <a href="http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/index.html">Steve Jones</a> had a blog. At least, I think this Steve Jones is the Steve Jones that I know. But I'm not sure. Either way, it looks good so I subscribed...
