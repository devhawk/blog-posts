Michael spent a bunch of time on the issues of user experience design that I\u2019m not familiar with. I still don\u2019t know why he was talking about the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/tg\/detail\/-\/B0009351ES\/103-0060861-4573421\">Cuddle Chimp<\/a>. But then he started talking about the importance of the sketching process to the practice of design. His meta point is that sketching is the root design tool, and different mediums are better or worse at supporting sketching. Drawing, as you might expect, is the best medium for sketching. Hardware is the worst. Michael rated a variety of sketching mediums based on Speed, Provisionality and History Preservation. By this time I figured out they were talking about enabling sketching of hardware.<\/p>\n<p>Then Matt got up. I didn\u2019t get his bio written down, but he is a professor of experience design. And he was talking about a product he\u2019s been involved in to enable rapid sketching of hardware user experiences using simple sensors and motors. The product is called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sketchtools.com\/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=91\">Nada<\/a> and it supports Flash and Java. No .NET? Nope, but I spoke to Matt after the session about it. The demos were pretty cool. He controlled the opacity of an element in Flash with a hardware potentiometer. He controlled the speed of a fan based on the current temperature reported via a website. He showed a variety of other sensors like light sensors and flex resiststors. These demos weren\u2019t that compelling, but the potential is huge. It can connect to variety of hardware systems including serial port devices, MIDI devices, plus kits like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makingthings.com\/\">Teleo<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.phidgets.com\/\">Phidgets<\/a>.
