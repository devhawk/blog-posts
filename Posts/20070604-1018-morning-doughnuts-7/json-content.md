Once again I get the chance to fill in for Harry while he is gone. I
will attempt to keep up with the high standard he has set.

-   Be careful with trampolines. I have a four year old that was
    bouncing on a trampoline this weekend. He twisted his knee slightly
    on landing, and decided that the fastest way to get comfort was to
    jump off the edge. His knee gave out and he fractured his tibia. I
    don’t think this was how he planned to start his summer. At least he
    is pretty calm about the whole thing.
-   It looks like there is a good product out there named
    [CliSecure](http://www.secureteam.net/) to obfuscate .net code. From
    what I was able to read it looks like a pretty decent product, even
    hiding the code while its in memory. (via

-   [TechEd](https://www1.msteched.com/public/agenda.aspx) started this
    morning. While I am sure Harry will be giving some on-site reports
    there is a link to the virtual site
    [here](http://www.virtualteched.com/Pages/default.aspx).
-   There is a great
    [video](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/hohpe-soa-development)
    showing [Gregor
    Hohpe](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/gregor.html)
    talking about SOA, and the many unrealistic claims in the industry.
    If you have read any of Hohpe’s work it is clear that he has a great
    understanding of the topic. (via [Nick

-   The [NBA Finals](http://netscape.nba.com/finals2007/index.html) will
    begin this week with the
    [Spurs](http://www.nba.com/spurs/news/playoffs_2007.html) playing
    the [Cavaliers](http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/) and [King
    LeBron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James). I wonder if this
    will help rescue the NBA from what seems to be a real apathy on the
    part of the average fan. Other than the series between Dallas
    and Golden State earlier in the play-offs it really seems there
    haven’t been any compelling stories. The NBA really needs a shot in
    the arm to become relevant again.
