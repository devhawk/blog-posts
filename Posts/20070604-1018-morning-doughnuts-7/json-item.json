He twisted his knee slightly on landing, and decided that the fastest way to get comfort was to jump off the edge. His\u00a0knee gave out and he fractured his tibia. I don&#8217;t think this was how he planned to start his summer. At least he is pretty calm about the whole thing.<\/li>\n<li>It looks like there is a good product out there named <a href=\"http:\/\/www.secureteam.net\/\">CliSecure<\/a>\u00a0to obfuscate .net code. From what I was able to read it looks like a pretty decent product, even hiding the code while its in memory.

I wonder if this will help rescue the NBA from what seems to be a real apathy on the part of the average fan. Other than the series between Dallas and\u00a0Golden State\u00a0earlier in the play-offs it really seems there haven&#8217;t been any compelling stories. The NBA really needs a shot in the arm to become relevant again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Once again I get the chance to fill in for Harry while he is gone.
