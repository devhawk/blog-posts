<p>Once again I get the chance to fill in for Harry while he is gone. I will attempt to keep up with the high standard he has set.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be careful with trampolines. I have a four year old that was bouncing on a trampoline this weekend. He twisted his knee slightly on landing, and decided that the fastest way to get comfort was to jump off the edge. His&nbsp;knee gave out and he fractured his tibia. I don&#8217;t think this was how he planned to start his summer. At least he is pretty calm about the whole thing.</li>
<li>It looks like there is a good product out there named <a href="http://www.secureteam.net/">CliSecure</a>&nbsp;to obfuscate .net code. From what I was able to read it looks like a pretty decent product, even hiding the code while its in memory. (via <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1156.aspx">Larkware</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www1.msteched.com/public/agenda.aspx">TechEd</a> started this morning. While I am sure Harry will be giving some on-site reports there is a link to the virtual site <a href="http://www.virtualteched.com/Pages/default.aspx">here</a>.</li>
<li>There is a great <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/hohpe-soa-development">video</a> showing <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/gregor.html">Gregor Hohpe</a> talking about SOA, and the many unrealistic claims in the industry. If you have read any of Hohpe&#8217;s work it is clear that he has a great understanding of the topic.

<li>The <a href="http://netscape.nba.com/finals2007/index.html">NBA Finals</a> will begin this week with the <a href="http://www.nba.com/spurs/news/playoffs_2007.html">Spurs</a> playing the <a href="http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/">Cavaliers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James">King LeBron</a>. I wonder if this will help rescue the NBA from what seems to be a real apathy on the part of the average fan. Other than the series between Dallas and&nbsp;Golden State&nbsp;earlier in the play-offs it really seems there haven&#8217;t been any compelling stories. The NBA really needs a shot in the arm to become relevant again.</li>
