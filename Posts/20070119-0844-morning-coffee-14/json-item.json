The basic idea of both keyboards is that the keyface is a little LED screen. Apparently, they&#8217;re planning on releasing a production version of the full keyboard <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artlebedev.com\/everything\/optimus\/answers\/\">this year<\/a>. The 3-key keyboard is <a href=\"http:\/\/store.artlebedev.com\/catalog\/computer_add-ons\/optimus-mini-three\/\">$160<\/a>, so I&#8217;m guessing the full keyboard will cost quite a bit.

I&#8217;m guessing these are people who don&#8217;t understand much about how such working groups work. As Chris writes, most of his time as chair will be herding cats. (via <a href=\"http:\/\/programming.reddit.com\/\">reddit<\/a>)  <\/li>\n<li>I am interested to see what this new working group produces. The #1 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2006\/11\/HTML-WG-charter.html#deliverables\">deliverable<\/a>\u00a0for this group is &#8220;A language evolved from HTML4 for describing the semantics of documents <strong><u>and applications<\/u><\/strong>on the World Wide Web&#8221; (emphasis added). Given the already existing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2006\/webapi\/\">Web API WG<\/a>, it would be nice to see an application model as a formalized part of HTML.  <\/li>\n<li>Again <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/ImprovingOutlookTodayWithJelloDashboard.aspx\">via Scott<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/jello.wordpress.com\/\">Jello.Dashboard<\/a> is a replacement for Outlook Today with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidco.com\/what_is_gtd.php\">GTD<\/a> bent. However, as Scott points out, it is <em>slow<\/em>. Scott blames the Outlook Automation APIs, but I think the scripting engine is also to blame. In the <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/01\/10\/Outlook+Integration+Sample.aspx\">CRM Integration for Outlook<\/a> sample, I used a <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/aa479345.aspx#otlkcustinentapp_topic9\">WinForms UserControl as a folder homepage<\/a> and didn&#8217;t notice any perf issues. If you expose a WinForms UserControl as a COM control (via Guid and ComVisible attributes), you can then host that control within an HTML file which is set as the folder home page. The sample includes a helper function to generate the HTML folder home page to host the UserControl. If there&#8217;s interest, I can post a small sample. Not only is this approach faster than a script based one, it&#8217;s easier to design and debug.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I just realized that I had Morning Coffee 9 both last Friday\u00a0and last Monday.
