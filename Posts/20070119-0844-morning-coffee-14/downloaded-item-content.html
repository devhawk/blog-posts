<p>I just realized that I had Morning Coffee 9 both <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/12/Late+Morning+Coffee+9.aspx">last Friday</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/15/Morning+Coffee+9.aspx">last Monday</a>. Woops. Rather than changing the titles of four posts, I&#8217;m just skipping #13 instead. Just like a hotel.</p>

<li>The folks behing the <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/">Optimus concept keyboard</a> are shipping a <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus-mini/">mini 3-key keyboard</a>. The basic idea of both keyboards is that the keyface is a little LED screen. Apparently, they&#8217;re planning on releasing a production version of the full keyboard <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/answers/">this year</a>. The 3-key keyboard is <a href="http://store.artlebedev.com/catalog/computer_add-ons/optimus-mini-three/">$160</a>, so I&#8217;m guessing the full keyboard will cost quite a bit.

<li><a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200701/new_w3c_html_working_group_chaired_by_microsoft/">Some</a><a href="http://glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?2007/01/11/2420-future-of-the-html-wg-3">people</a> are up in arms that the chair of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/11/HTML-WG-charter.html">new W3C HTML Working Group</a> is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cwilso/archive/2007/01/10/you-me-and-the-w3c-aka-reinventing-html.aspx">Chris Wilson from Microsoft</a>. I&#8217;m guessing these are people who don&#8217;t understand much about how such working groups work. As Chris writes, most of his time as chair will be herding cats.

<li>I am interested to see what this new working group produces. The #1 <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/11/HTML-WG-charter.html#deliverables">deliverable</a>&nbsp;for this group is &#8220;A language evolved from HTML4 for describing the semantics of documents <strong><u>and applications</u></strong>on the World Wide Web&#8221; (emphasis added). Given the already existing <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/webapi/">Web API WG</a>, it would be nice to see an application model as a formalized part of HTML.  </li>
<li>Again <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImprovingOutlookTodayWithJelloDashboard.aspx">via Scott</a>, <a href="http://jello.wordpress.com/">Jello.Dashboard</a> is a replacement for Outlook Today with a <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">GTD</a> bent. However, as Scott points out, it is <em>slow</em>. Scott blames the Outlook Automation APIs, but I think the scripting engine is also to blame. In the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/01/10/Outlook+Integration+Sample.aspx">CRM Integration for Outlook</a> sample, I used a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479345.aspx#otlkcustinentapp_topic9">WinForms UserControl as a folder homepage</a> and didn&#8217;t notice any perf issues. If you expose a WinForms UserControl as a COM control (via Guid and ComVisible attributes), you can then host that control within an HTML file which is set as the folder home page. The sample includes a helper function to generate the HTML folder home page to host the UserControl. If there&#8217;s interest, I can post a small sample. Not only is this approach faster than a script based one, it&#8217;s easier to design and debug.</li>
