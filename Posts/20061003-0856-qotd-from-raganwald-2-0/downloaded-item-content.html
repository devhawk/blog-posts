<p>Saw these on <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Reg Braithwaite&#8217;s</a> while I was reading that <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/09/wasabi-cannot-cure-rotten-fish.html">Wasabi cannot cure rotten fish</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you want to build a ship, don&#8217;t drum up people to collect wood and don&#8217;t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.&#8221;<br><a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/a/antoine_de_saintexupery.html">Antoine de Saint-Exupery</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And my new personal personal favorite:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you&#8217;ll have to ram them down people&#8217;s throats.&#8221;<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Aiken">Howard Aitken</a></p>

<p>I like that quote so much, I updated my email signature to include it.</p>
