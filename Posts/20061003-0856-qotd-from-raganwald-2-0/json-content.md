Saw these on [Reg Braithwaite’s](http://weblog.raganwald.com/) while I
was reading that [Wasabi cannot cure rotten
fish](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/09/wasabi-cannot-cure-rotten-fish.html).

> “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people to collect wood and
> don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for
> the endless immensity of the sea.”\
> [Antoine de
> Saint-Exupery](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/a/antoine_de_saintexupery.html)

And my new personal personal favorite:

> “Don’t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any
> good, you’ll have to ram them down people’s throats.”\
> [Howard Aitken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Aiken)

I like that quote so much, I updated my email signature to include it.
