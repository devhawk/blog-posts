<p>This is way off topic, but did you ever notice that the characters on Sesame Street that date back to the 70&#8242;s &#8211; Big Bird, Grover, Oscar the Grouch, Cookie Monster, The Count, etc. &#8211; are all adults while the more recent additions like Elmo, Rosita, Zoe and Baby Bear are all kids. I&#8217;m not sure what it means, but it made me think: Did the makers of the show decide they needed characters that kids could identify with better? Or did the original characters somehow grow up? That&#8217;s a sorta wacky thought. </p>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering, Patrick watches Sesame Steet every morning and I have to sit in with him to make sure he doesn&#8217;t climb out of his high chair.</p>
