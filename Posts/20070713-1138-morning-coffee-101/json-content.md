-   In doing a little LINQ research, I stumbled upon Wes Dyer’s [Yet
    Another Language Geek](http://blogs.msdn.com/wesdyer/default.aspx)
    blog. Fascinating stuff.
    [Subscribed](http://blogs.msdn.com/wesdyer/rss.xml). Be sure to
    check out his [recent
    posts](http://blogs.msdn.com/wesdyer/archive/2007/05/23/in-case-you-haven-t-heard.aspx)
    about [Partial
    Methods](http://blogs.msdn.com/wesdyer/archive/2007/05/31/more-on-partial-methods.aspx),
    another new C\# 3.0 ([and
    VB9](http://blogs.msdn.com/timng/archive/2007/06/02/partial-methods-for-visual-basic.aspx))
    language feature.
-   Werner Vogles has a [great
    post](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/07/the_different_cto_roles.html)
    on what a CTO does, including a summary of [four different
    approaches](http://www.brixtonspa.com/Career/The_Role_of_the_CTO_4Models.pdf)
    to the job.
-   Somasegar [lets us
    know](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/07/13/it-all-begins-february-27th.aspx)
    that even though VS08 doesn’t launch until February of next year,
    MSFT is “still aiming to release Visual Studio 2008 and .NET FX 3.5
    by the end of this year”.
-   There’s a new version of the Windows Live Mobile Search client. The
    Virtual Earth / Live Search team blog [has the
    details](http://virtualearth.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns%212BBC66E99FDCDB98%218910.entry).
    New features include Movie Showtimes, More Local Data with Reviews
    and improved Maps and Directions (including GPS integration). Can’t
    wait to get this installed. (via [Dare
    Obasanjo](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/07/13/LiveSearchForMobile20IsAvailable.aspx))
-   [XNA Gamefest](http://www.xnagamefest.com) is coming up next month.
    It’s sort of like PDC for game developers. It’s where we make our
    big game dev announcements – last year, we [announced XNA
    GSE](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/aug06/08-13xnagamestudiopr.mspx)
    there. They recently published their [session
    abstracts](http://www.xnagamefest.com/talk_abstracts.htm), including
    a whole track on [XNA Game Studio
    ~~Express~~](http://www.xnagamefest.com/talk_abstracts.htm#XNA_GAME_STUDIO).
    As Shawn Hargreaves [points
    out](http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2007/07/12/gamefest.aspx),
    an “enterprising reader could probably make a good guess” about some
    of the new stuff getting announced @ Gamefest.
