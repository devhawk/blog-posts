<p>So between this mornings <a title="multi-touch interface demo" href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/9091">multi-touch interface demo</a> and the session on <a title="Amazon's Mechanical Turk service" href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8267">Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk service</a>, my laptop died. At least, the display did. Sometimes I can get it to work for a short time by closing and re-opening the lid. But in the constant jostling environment of a confernce audience, getting it to keep working has proved impossible.</p>
<p>Of course this couldn&#8217;t happen while I&#8217;m at home with convienent access to the help desk. I&#8217;m at the Emerging Tech conferences for pete sake! </p>
<p>I would have just bought a laptop at CompUSA or something, but that qualifies as a captial expenditure and my boss wouldn&#8217;t sign off on it (primarily because of the paperwork he&#8217;d have to fill out). Luckily, <a title="CRE Rentals" href="http://www.computerrentals.com/">CRE Rentals</a> was able to get a machine over to me in a few hours so I&#8217;m back online. I guess I won&#8217;t be doing any more coding this trip, but I guess I&#8217;ll survive. </p>
<p>More from ETech later. In the meantime, check out Ray Ozzie&#8217;s blog entry on <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry">Wiring the Web</a>. I may be biased, but it&#8217;s the coolest new thing I&#8217;ve seen here so far (though the multi-touch interface is pretty awesome too)</p>
