<p>I&#8217;m in LA today for about 9 hours. This figures to be one of my last business trips for my old role: introducing a member of my old team to one of my old customers. My wife tells me it&#8217;s beautiful back home. Here, it&#8217;s overcast and ugly. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sitting in a Starbucks killing an hour before I go pick up my old teammate. Everyone has their favorite coffee spot that they are loyal to. I&#8217;m loyal to Starbucks because they&#8217;re everywhere and many of them are WiFi hotspots. Extra bonus: today is &#8220;<a href="http://www.intel.com/unwire/one_unwired_day.htm">One Unwired Day</a>&#8221; by Intel, so access is free.</p>
