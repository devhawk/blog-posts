<p>I'm in LA today for about 9 hours. This figures to be one of my last business trips for my old role: introducing a member of my old team to one of my old customers. My wife tells me it's beautiful back home. Here, it's overcast and ugly. </p><p>I'm sitting in a Starbucks killing an hour before I go pick up my old teammate. Everyone has their favorite coffee spot that they are loyal to. I'm loyal to Starbucks because they're everywhere and many of them are WiFi hotspots. Extra bonus: today is "<a href="http://www.intel.com/unwire/one_unwired_day.htm">One Unwired Day</a>" by Intel, so access is free.</p>
