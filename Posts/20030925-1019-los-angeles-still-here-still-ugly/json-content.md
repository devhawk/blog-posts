I’m in LA today for about 9 hours. This figures to be one of my last
business trips for my old role: introducing a member of my old team to
one of my old customers. My wife tells me it’s beautiful back home.
Here, it’s overcast and ugly.

I’m sitting in a Starbucks killing an hour before I go pick up my old
teammate. Everyone has their favorite coffee spot that they are loyal
to. I’m loyal to Starbucks because they’re everywhere and many of them
are WiFi hotspots. Extra bonus: today is “[One Unwired
Day](http://www.intel.com/unwire/one_unwired_day.htm)” by Intel, so
access is free.
