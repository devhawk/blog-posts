Maybe I&#8217;m still getting used to this whole Outlook news reader thing, but I don&#8217;t understand why NewsGator continues to flatten my OPML hierarchy. RSS Bandit, SharpReader and intraVnews all respect my hierarchy. I may not read as much as Scoble, but I am reading over 200 blogs these days and I like to categorize them. Favorites, GDN Workspaces, .NET bloggers, MSFT bloggers, Blogs I only scan the headlines of before I delete them, etc. But when I import that same OPML into NewsGator, it gets flattened into one big list of feeds. Apparently, you can manually move the folders around once they are created, but I&#8217;m not interested in doing that 200+ times. <\/p>\n<p>Too bad, because the online services looked cool.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I downloaded and installed the new NewsGator trial in a VPC to see how it looks.

Not only did you have to manually move the folders to their categories, but if you removed column headings, you had to do that 200+ times also.
