First, Amigo Grady Booch admits to [throwing away
models](http://devhawk.net/2005/11/07/grady-booch-sez-throw-models-away/).
Now, Amigo [Ivar Jacobson](http://www.ivarjacobson.com) has signed on as
a VSIP partner:

> Microsoft has tapped Ivar Jacobson, known as one of the fathers of the
> popular Rational Unified Process (RUP), to lead an effort to deliver a
> lightweight unified process to the Microsoft Solutions Framework.
>
> \<snip\>
>
> Jacobson said the first fruits of his company’s relationship with
> Microsoft will be through the delivery of the Essential Unified
> Process (Essential UP), which is based on the Microsoft Solutions
> Framework and integrated with VSTS.
>
> In short, Essential UP is a simplified or lighter-weight alternative
> to RUP, Jacobson said. Essential UP is an evolution of the unified
> process Jacobson helped create more than 10 years ago that forms the
> foundation of RUP, he said.
>
> \<snip\>
>
> “We need more lightweight processes,” Jacobson said, noting that RUP
> has become too heavyweight and cumbersome. “We have competition from
> India, China and the former Soviet Union,” he said. “It is not enough
> to be agile.”
>
> Indeed, Microsoft has done a good job with its Microsoft Solutions
> Framework, and “their process agility is a clear differentiator for
> them,” Jacobson said.
>
> “Essential UP stands on all the experience we have from RUP, but also
> offers us a chance to have a fresh start,” Jacobson said. “We start in
> a new way because we’ve learned what works and what doesn’t work.”
>
> \<snip\>
>
> “RUP has a lot of good stuff, but it needs a correction,” [Jacobson]
> said.
>
> \<snip\>
>
> However, among the primary problems Jacobson said he has with RUP is
> that it is “heavyweight.”
>
> Also, “the process architecture needs to be refactored,” Jacobson
> said. “It is very difficult to add new practices because it will force
> a big change in the base. For instance, adding in a streamlined way
> practices such as EA [Enterprise Architect], SOA [service-oriented
> architecture], ABD [asset-based development], re-engineering legacy
> systems and commercial off-the-shelf software would be very difficult,
> if at all possible. So I believe in starting all over fresh but not
> throwing away anything that is good.”
>
> \<snip\>
>
> “Having an industry luminary build the next version of his tool for
> our platform is huge for us,” [VSTS General Manager Rick] LaPlante
> said.

I’d like to nominate Rick’s comment for understatement of the year
awards. It also gets me wondering what Amigo Jim Rumbaugh is up to these
days.
