<p>In my series on <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/10/06/Lightweight+Debugging+For+Hybrid+CIronPython+Apps.aspx">Hybrid App Debugging</a>, I showed the following code for executing a Python file in a hybrid C#/IronPython app.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">private void Window_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    ScriptEngine engine = Python.CreateEngine();
    ScriptScope  scope = engine.CreateScope();
    scope.SetVariable(&quot;items&quot;, lbThings.Items);
    engine.ExecuteFile(&quot;getthings.py&quot;, scope);
}
</pre>
<p>The <a href="javascript:window.location.href='http://dlr.codeplex.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?DownloadId=84001';">DLR Hosting API</a> has three distinct levels of functionality. As simple as this is, technically it&#8217;s level 2 since it&#8217;s using a ScriptEngine directly. If you wanted to use the simplest level 1 hosting API, you could use runtimes instead of engines and save a line of code.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">private void Window_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    ScriptRuntime runtime = Python.CreateRuntime();
    runtime.Globals.SetVariable(&quot;items&quot;, lbThings.Items);
    runtime.ExecuteFile(&quot;getthings.py&quot;);
}
</pre>
<p>The ScriptRuntime version of ExecuteFile doesn&#8217;t include an overload that takes a ScriptScope like ScriptEngine does, so instead you add the items variable to the globals scope. However, this doesn&#8217;t automatically add the items object to every child scope &#8211; you have to explicitly import items into the local scope if you want to use it. So for Python, that means you need to add &#8220;import items&#8221; to the top of the GetThings.py script. Nothing else changes.</p>
<p>Personally, I find DLR Hosting API Level 2 to be straightforward and easy enough to understand, so I tend to code to that level by default. I actually had to go read the doc to discover the ScriptRuntime.Globals property and talk to Dino about importing those variables into a local scope. However, I wanted to point out that nothing in my Hybrid App Debugging sample so far is really dependent on the level 2 API. If you just want to execute some Python files in the context of your C# application, you can stick with the simpler level 1 API if you want. You can even use lightweight debugging with the level 1 API &#8211; there&#8217;s an overload of the SetTrace extension method for ScriptRuntimes just as there is for ScriptEngines. Just something to keep in mind.</p>
