<p>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/10/Hawk+Eye+On+Live+Toolbar+First+Run+Experience.aspx">wrote last week</a> about the need for a better first run expereince for the new <a href="http://toolbar.live.com">Live Toolbar</a>. I just went to install the toolbar on my dev partition and lo and behold, the first run experience is fixed! It now presents a list of installable components with the most popular ones preselected. Much better.</p>
