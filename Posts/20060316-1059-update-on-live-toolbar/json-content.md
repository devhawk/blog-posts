I [wrote last
week](http://devhawk.net/2006/03/10/hawk-eye-on-live-toolbar-first-run-experience/)
about the need for a better first run expereince for the new [Live
Toolbar](http://toolbar.live.com). I just went to install the toolbar on
my dev partition and lo and behold, the first run experience is fixed!
It now presents a list of installable components with the most popular
ones preselected. Much better.
