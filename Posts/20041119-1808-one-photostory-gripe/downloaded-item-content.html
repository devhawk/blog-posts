<p>I&#8217;m pretty impressed with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory/default.mspx">new Photo Story</a>. I&#8217;ve been tracking this program since it was a research project so it&#8217;s been cool to watch it evolve. However, I did run into something I didn&#8217;t like in the new version. Once you&#8217;ve built a Photo Story, you can render it to a variety of target profiles. One of the target profiles is for SmartPhone. I&#8217;ve recently got an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devices/devicedisplay.aspx?module=deviceDisplay;Smartphone;americas;134">MPx220</a> so I figured I&#8217;d&nbsp;try it out.&nbsp;Didn&#8217;t work as Photo Story&#8217;s target profile is for SmartPhone <em>with </em><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/windowsmobile/default.aspx"><em>Windows Media Player 10 Mobile</em></a>&nbsp;which the MPx220 doesn&#8217;t have installed. Woops. And you can&#8217;t upgrade the device to WMP10 Mobile. Double woops.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m annoyed that I can&#8217;t install WMP10 Mobile on my MPx220, I&#8217;m more annoyed at Photo Story. There&#8217;s no way to build a custom target profile that would work with my phone. I was able to build an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx">encoder profile</a> to convert a Photo Story rendered for the desktop to be converted down to work well on the SmartPhone. Why can&#8217;t I just do that inside Photo Story?</p>
