<p>I'm pretty impressed with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory/default.mspx">new Photo Story</a>. I've been tracking this program since it was a research project so it's been cool to watch it evolve. However, I did run into something I didn't like in the new version. Once you've built a Photo Story, you can render it to a variety of target profiles. One of the target profiles is for SmartPhone. I've recently got an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devices/devicedisplay.aspx?module=deviceDisplay;Smartphone;americas;134">MPx220</a> so I figured I'd try it out. Didn't work as Photo Story's target profile is for SmartPhone <em>with </em><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/windowsmobile/default.aspx"><em>Windows Media Player 10 Mobile</em></a> which the MPx220 doesn't have installed. Woops. And you can't upgrade the device to WMP10 Mobile. Double woops.</p><p>While I'm annoyed that I can't install WMP10 Mobile on my MPx220, I'm more annoyed at Photo Story. There's no way to build a custom target profile that would work with my phone. I was able to build an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx">encoder profile</a> to convert a Photo Story rendered for the desktop to be converted down to work well on the SmartPhone. Why can't I just do that inside Photo Story?</p>
