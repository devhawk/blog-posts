Once you&#8217;ve built a Photo Story, you can render it to a variety of target profiles. One of the target profiles is for SmartPhone. I&#8217;ve recently got an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windowsmobile\/devices\/devicedisplay.aspx?module=deviceDisplay;Smartphone;americas;134\">MPx220<\/a> so I figured I&#8217;d\u00a0try it out.\u00a0Didn&#8217;t work as Photo Story&#8217;s target profile is for SmartPhone <em>with <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/windowsmedia\/player\/windowsmobile\/default.aspx\"><em>Windows Media Player 10 Mobile<\/em><\/a>\u00a0which the MPx220 doesn&#8217;t have installed.

I was able to build an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/windowsmedia\/9series\/encoder\/default.aspx\">encoder profile<\/a> to convert a Photo Story rendered for the desktop to be converted down to work well on the SmartPhone. Why can&#8217;t I just do that inside Photo Story?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m pretty impressed with the new Photo Story.
