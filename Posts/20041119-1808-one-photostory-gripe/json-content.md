I’m pretty impressed with the [new Photo
Story](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory/default.mspx).
I’ve been tracking this program since it was a research project so it’s
been cool to watch it evolve. However, I did run into something I didn’t
like in the new version. Once you’ve built a Photo Story, you can render
it to a variety of target profiles. One of the target profiles is for
SmartPhone. I’ve recently got an
[MPx220](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devices/devicedisplay.aspx?module=deviceDisplay;Smartphone;americas;134)
so I figured I’d try it out. Didn’t work as Photo Story’s target profile
is for SmartPhone *with* [*Windows Media Player 10
Mobile*](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/windowsmobile/default.aspx) which
the MPx220 doesn’t have installed. Woops. And you can’t upgrade the
device to WMP10 Mobile. Double woops.

While I’m annoyed that I can’t install WMP10 Mobile on my MPx220, I’m
more annoyed at Photo Story. There’s no way to build a custom target
profile that would work with my phone. I was able to build an [encoder
profile](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx)
to convert a Photo Story rendered for the desktop to be converted down
to work well on the SmartPhone. Why can’t I just do that inside Photo
Story?
