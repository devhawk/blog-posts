-   If you don’t want to watch the [video of yesterday’s MIX
    keynote](http://www.visitmix.com/blogs/Joshua/Day-1-Keynote/) but
    still want a sense of what happened, check out Tim Sneath’s [keynote
    liveblog](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2008/03/05/mix08-keynote-live-blog.aspx).

-   Other announcements from Mix day one keynote that I missed (all via
    [Tim
    Sneath](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2008/03/05/mix08-keynote-live-blog.aspx))
    -   [Windows Media Services for
        WS08](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/serve/prodinfo2008.aspx)
        released last week. Additionally, the [IIS 7 Media
        Pack](http://www.iis.net/default.aspx?tabid=22) adds web
        playlists (CTP) and bandwidth throttling (GoLive beta) to the
        baseline media streaming platform.
    -   The [source code (and unit
        tests)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ea93dd89-3af2-4acb-9cf4-bfe01b3f02d4&displaylang=en)
        for all the built-in Silverlight 2 controls is available for
        download. I’m not a lawyer, but it doesn’t look like a
        “reference-only” licence like the [.NET Framework source code is
        released
        under](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/01/16/net-framework-library-source-code-now-available.aspx).
        Very cool.
    -   The [Seadragon technology](http://labs.live.com/Seadragon.aspx)
        for smooth navigation of mutli-gigabyte sized images over the
        network will be emnedded in Silverlight as a feature called
        DeepZoom. You can see a cool demo of DeepZoom on the [Hard Rock
        Memorabilia site](http://memorabilia.hardrock.com/) and Scott
        Hanselman [posted a
        walkthru](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DeepZoomSeadragonSilverlight2MultiScaleImagesAtMix.aspx)
        of using the [DeepZoom Composer
        preview](http://blogs.msdn.com/expression/archive/2008/03/05/download-the-preview-of-the-deep-zoom-composer.aspx)
        tool build your own DeepZoom experience.
    -   Apparently the [.NET client
        roadmap](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/19/net-3-5-client-product-roadmap.aspx)
        isn’t all perf and working set improvements. WPF is getting
        shader support. I couldn’t find *anything* on this besides the
        announcement itself, but I’ll be interested how much overlap
        there is with the [DirectX / XNA shader
        language](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb509561(VS.85).aspx).
-   Quick side note – Installing Silverlight 2 in order to check out the
    DeepZoom Hard Rock demo was smooth, fast and easy. It’s hard to
    believe there’s a whole CLR in there.
-   Now on to public stuff I saw @ TechFest:
    -   One of the problems with touch screens is that your fingers
        obscure what you’re trying to touch. [Lucid
        Touch](http://research.microsoft.com/users/baudisch/projects/lucidtouch/)
        solves this by having you touch the back of the device, while
        rendering a virtual shadow of your hand – a technique they call
        “pseudo transparency”. You really need to watch [the
        video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsNFZAEssPQ) to “get”
        this. It’s not currently feasible – the prototype uses a webcam
        on a foot long boom to track hand and finger position. However,
        they expect a future version will have some type of imaging
        sensors embedded in the body of the device.
    -   The Berkeley Emulation Engine version 3 (aka
        [BEE3](http://research.microsoft.com/projects/BEE3/))
        ([video](http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/techfest/videos/video_d.aspx))
        is a high powered hardware simulator. Apparently several orders
        of magnitudes faster than conventional simulation. Frankly, most
        of this demo was over my head and I’m not really a HW guy. But
        it sounds really fast.
    -   [BLEWS](http://research.microsoft.com/projects/blews/blews.aspx)
        or “what the blogosphere tells you about news”. Given my
        interest in political blogging, it’s not a surprise I was
        interested in this project. This tool categorizes news stories
        according to their reception in the political blogosphere. It
        provides a visualization showing not only how many links from a
        given ideological sphere there are, but how strong the emotions
        are running. Kinda like
        [Memorandum](http://www.memeorandum.com/) on major steroids.
    -   Music Steering
        ([video](http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/videos/video_f.aspx))
        is an “interactive music-playlist generation through
        music-content analysis, music recommendation, and music
        filtering”. Sort of like LastFM + Pandora on your Zune.
    -   In-Depth Image Editing ([team
        site](http://research.microsoft.com/vision/cambridge/i3l/default.htm))
        showed some cool photo editing software that reminding me of
        [Microsoft Max](http://www.microsoft.com/max/).
    -   MashupOS
        ([paper](http://research.microsoft.com/users/helenw/papers/mashupos-hotos))
        is a set of abstractions to improve the browser security model,
        allowing for isolation between blocks of code from different
        sources while still allowing safe forms of communication.
    -   [MySong](http://research.microsoft.com/users/dan/mysong/%20)
        ([paper](http://research.microsoft.com/users/dan/mysong/MySongCHI2008.pdf),
        [video](http://research.microsoft.com/users/dan/mysong/MySongCHI2008.wmv))
        “automatically chooses chords to accompany a vocal melody,
        allowing a user with no musical training to rapidly create
        accompanied music”. Karaoke singers rejoice! Actually, it’s
        pretty cool. You can adjust sliders to adjust characteristics of
        the generated music like “Jazz factor” and “Happy factor”.
        Actually, I just want a happy factor slider in all my software.
    -   I saw some cool projects from the [Socio-Digital
        Systems](http://research.microsoft.com/sds/) group and MS
        Research. My wife is a sociologist and always says there’s no
        way she could ever get a job in the big house. Maybe after she
        checks out this team, she’ll stop thinking that.
    -   The [Worldwide Telescope](http://worldwidetelescope.org/) booth
        was so crowded that I couldn’t get anywhere near it. From what I
        could see from standing in the back, it looked fantastic. It’s
        not live yet, but you can check out the [video from the TED
        conference](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/224) to get a sense
        of it.
