Additionally, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iis.net\/default.aspx?tabid=22\">IIS 7 Media Pack<\/a> adds web playlists (CTP) and bandwidth throttling (GoLive beta) to the baseline media streaming platform.  <\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyID=ea93dd89-3af2-4acb-9cf4-bfe01b3f02d4&amp;displaylang=en\">source code (and unit tests)<\/a> for all the built-in Silverlight 2 controls is available for download. I&#8217;m not a lawyer, but it doesn&#8217;t look like a &#8220;reference-only&#8221; licence like the <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2008\/01\/16\/net-framework-library-source-code-now-available.aspx\">.NET Framework source code is released under<\/a>. Very cool.  <\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.live.com\/Seadragon.aspx\">Seadragon technology<\/a> for smooth navigation of mutli-gigabyte sized images over the network will be emnedded in Silverlight as a feature called DeepZoom. You can see a cool demo of DeepZoom on the <a href=\"http:\/\/memorabilia.hardrock.com\/\">Hard Rock Memorabilia site<\/a> and Scott Hanselman <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/blog\/DeepZoomSeadragonSilverlight2MultiScaleImagesAtMix.aspx\">posted a walkthru<\/a> of using the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/expression\/archive\/2008\/03\/05\/download-the-preview-of-the-deep-zoom-composer.aspx\">DeepZoom Composer preview<\/a> tool build your own DeepZoom experience.  <\/li>\n<li>Apparently the <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2008\/02\/19\/net-3-5-client-product-roadmap.aspx\">.NET client roadmap<\/a> isn&#8217;t all perf and working set improvements. WPF is getting shader support. I couldn&#8217;t find <em>anything<\/em> on this besides the announcement itself, but I&#8217;ll be interested how much overlap there is with the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/bb509561(VS.85).aspx\">DirectX \/ XNA shader language<\/a>. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Quick side note &#8211; Installing Silverlight 2 in order to check out the DeepZoom Hard Rock demo was smooth, fast and easy. It&#8217;s hard to believe there&#8217;s a whole CLR in there.  <\/li>\n<li>Now on to public stuff I saw @ TechFest:\n<ul>\n<li>One of the problems with touch screens is that your fingers obscure what you&#8217;re trying to touch. <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/users\/baudisch\/projects\/lucidtouch\/\">Lucid Touch<\/a> solves this by having you touch the back of the device, while rendering a virtual shadow of your hand &#8211; a technique they call &#8220;pseudo transparency&#8221;. You really need to watch <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RsNFZAEssPQ\">the video<\/a> to &#8220;get&#8221; this. It&#8217;s not currently feasible &#8211; the prototype uses a webcam on a foot long boom to track hand and finger position. However, they expect a future version will have some type of imaging sensors embedded in the body of the device.  <\/li>\n<li>The Berkeley Emulation Engine version 3 (aka <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/projects\/BEE3\/\">BEE3<\/a>) (<a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/aboutmsr\/techfest\/videos\/video_d.aspx\">video<\/a>) is a high powered hardware simulator. Apparently several orders of magnitudes faster than conventional simulation. Frankly, most of this demo was over my head and I&#8217;m not really a HW guy. But it sounds really fast.  <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/projects\/blews\/blews.aspx\">BLEWS<\/a> or &#8220;what the blogosphere tells you about news&#8221;. Given my interest in political blogging, it&#8217;s not a surprise I was interested in this project. This tool categorizes news stories according to their reception in the political blogosphere. It provides a visualization showing not only how many links from a given ideological sphere there are, but how strong the emotions are running. Kinda like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.memeorandum.com\/\">Memorandum<\/a> on major steroids.  <\/li>\n<li>Music Steering (<a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/techfest\/videos\/video_f.aspx\">video<\/a>) is an &#8220;interactive music-playlist generation through music-content analysis, music recommendation, and music filtering&#8221;. Sort of like LastFM + Pandora on your Zune.  <\/li>\n<li>In-Depth Image Editing (<a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/vision\/cambridge\/i3l\/default.htm\">team site<\/a>) showed some cool photo editing software that reminding me of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/max\/\">Microsoft Max<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li>MashupOS (<a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/users\/helenw\/papers\/mashupos-hotos\">paper<\/a>) is a set of abstractions to improve the browser security model, allowing for isolation between blocks of code from different sources while still allowing safe forms of communication.  <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/users\/dan\/mysong\/ \">MySong<\/a> (<a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/users\/dan\/mysong\/MySongCHI2008.pdf\">paper<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/users\/dan\/mysong\/MySongCHI2008.wmv\">video<\/a>) &#8220;automatically chooses chords to accompany a vocal melody, allowing a user with no musical training to rapidly create accompanied music&#8221;. Karaoke singers rejoice! Actually, it&#8217;s pretty cool. You can adjust sliders to adjust characteristics of the generated music like &#8220;Jazz factor&#8221; and &#8220;Happy factor&#8221;. Actually, I just want a happy factor slider in all my software.  <\/li>\n<li>I saw some cool projects from the <a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/sds\/\">Socio-Digital Systems<\/a> group and MS Research. My wife is a sociologist and always says there&#8217;s no way she could ever get a job in the big house. Maybe after she checks out this team, she&#8217;ll stop thinking that.  <\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http:\/\/worldwidetelescope.org\/\">Worldwide Telescope<\/a> booth was so crowded that I couldn&#8217;t get anywhere near it. From what I could see from standing in the back, it looked fantastic. It&#8217;s not live yet, but you can check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/view\/id\/224\">video from the TED conference<\/a> to get a sense of it. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>If you don&#8217;t want to watch the video of yesterday&#8217;s MIX keynote but still want a sense of what happened, check out Tim Sneath&#8217;s keynote liveblog.
