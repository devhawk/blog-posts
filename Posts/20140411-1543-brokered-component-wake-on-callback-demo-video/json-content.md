As you might imagine, I had a pretty amazing time @
[Build](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/). The only thing
that went wrong all week was when one of my demos in [my
session](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-515)failed. It’s
was pretty cool demo – the brokered WinRT component fires an event which
wakes up a suspended WinRT app for a few seconds to process the event.
However, I had shut off toast notifications on my machine, which messed
up the demo. So here, for your enjoyment, is a short 3 minute video of
the working demo.
