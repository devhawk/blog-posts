As you might imagine, I had a pretty amazing time @ <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/">Build</a>. The only thing that went wrong all week was when one of my demos in <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-515">my session </a>failed. It's was pretty cool demo - the brokered WinRT component fires an event which wakes up a suspended WinRT app for a few seconds to process the event. However, I had shut off toast notifications on my machine, which messed up the demo. So here, for your enjoyment, is a short 3 minute video of the working demo.
