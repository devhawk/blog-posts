I’m not sounding off in the pub, so I guess I’ll blog the
[workshop](http://www.dsmforum.org/Events/ADDSL05/) that
[Alan](http://blogs.msdn.com/alan%5Fcameron%5Fwills/) and [Steven
Kelly](http://www.metacase.com/blogs/stevek/blogView) from
[MetaCase](http://www.metacase.com/) are doing at
[XP2005](http://www.xp2005.org/). It’s called “Agile Development with
Domain Specific Languages” and here’s the abstract:

> This workshop will investigate the application of Domain Specific
> Languages within Agile development. A Domain Specific Language (DSL)
> is designed to express the requirements and solutions of a particular
> business or architectural domain. SQL, GUI designers, workflow
> languages and regular expressions are familiar examples. In recent
> years, Domain-Specific Modeling has yielded spectacular productivity
> improvements in domains such as telephony and embedded systems. By
> creating graphical or textual languages specific to the needs of an
> individual project or product line within one company, DSM offers
> maximum agility. With current tools, creating a language and related
> tool support is fast enough to make DSM a realistic possibility for
> projects of all sizes.
