I finally got around to upgrading to Office 2003 Beta 2. Now I need to
move from FrontPage to InfoPath to make blog entries. Too bad there is
almost no documentation. Plus, I share [Early
Adopter’s](http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/2003/03/13.html#a181)
frustration that it’s script based instead of CLR based. I think
[Don’s](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/) enthusiasm for
[InfoPath](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/#nn2003-03-07T01:21:24Z)
has inflated expectations a bit. InfoPath is from the Office group, not
the VS.NET group. It’s an eForms tool, not an application development
tool. And last but not least, it’s a 1.0 product. I think that InfoPath
is a great start, but I’m not sure it’s the [second coming of
VB](http://radio.weblogs.com/0108971/2003/02/28.html#a120).

I want to break open than .xsn file and start playing with the schema,
transforms and other XML docs stored in there. If they are all XML, then
it should be possible to repurpose the files for alternative usage.
