<p>As I pointed out in my <a href="http://devhawk.net/Putting+A+Square+Peg+Model+In+A+Round+Hole+Tool.aspx">last post</a>, VS2005 includes a Class Designer that those familiar with the UML class model should feel right at home in. By happy coincidence, I found out today the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/classdesigner/">Class Designer team is blogging</a>. Additionally, two of the Class Designer team members - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/r.ramesh">Ramesh</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rakeshna">Rakesh</a> - are blogging on their own. Apparently, the team blog will feature a new post every Thursday. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/classdesigner/archive/2005/02/25/380023.aspx">This week's post</a> features an overview of the v1 Class Designer goals.
