<p>I know how I&#8217;m celebrating my birthday this year. Well, technically the day after my birthday.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been a movie buff and, other than Star Wars, I can&#8217;t think of a movie series that shaped the way I think about movies and movie making as much as Indiana Jones. I remember well going to see the first three Indiana Jones movies with my father. Of course, now I&#8217;m a father, but Patrick and Riley aren&#8217;t really ready for Indy yet. So they&#8217;ll have to be content with <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/legoindianajones/">Lego Indy</a> for a few more years. </p>
<p>Otherwise, here&#8217;s hoping Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull doesn&#8217;t suffer from Star Wars prequel-itis. </p>
