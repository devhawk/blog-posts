<p>I know how I'm celebrating my birthday this year. Well, technically the day after my birthday.</p><p><embed id="uvp_fop" src="http://l.yimg.com/cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/fop/embedflv/swf/fop.swf" width="690" height="390" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" flashvars="id=6441610&amp;rd=eyc-off&amp;ympsc=&amp;prepanelEnable=1&amp;infopanelEnable=1"></embed></p><p>I've always been a movie buff and, other than Star Wars, I can't think of a movie series that shaped the way I think about movies and movie making as much as Indiana Jones. I remember well going to see the first three Indiana Jones movies with my father. Of course, now I'm a father, but Patrick and Riley aren't really ready for Indy yet. So they'll have to be content with <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/legoindianajones/">Lego Indy</a> for a few more years. </p><p>Otherwise, here's hoping Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull doesn't suffer from Star Wars prequel-itis. </p>
