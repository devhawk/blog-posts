*(Harry is @ DevTeach in Vancounver with his family this week. He was
hoping to still do Morning Coffee posts, but that’s turned out to be
infeasible. So instead, you get a series of pre-written posts about
F\#.)*

I’ve been spending some real quality time with F\# of late. I’ve been
getting into parsing again, and it turns out that functional pattern
matching languages like F\# are really good at text processing. After
[claiming](http://devhawk.net/2007/01/10/morning-coffee-7/) I’d
learn F\# this year, then [abandoning the
effort](http://devhawk.net/2007/02/06/morning-coffee-25/) to learn
Powershell, I went back to F\#. Nothing against PowerShell – I’ve moved
over to using it as my primary command line shell and have tricked out
my startup script and everything. But I haven’t found much need to code
in it lately.

If you’re a .NET ninja guru, you owe it to yourself to take a long look
at F\#, if for no other reason to expand your mind. It takes a while to
get used to. [Don Syme](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/) (aka father of
F\#) can attest I’ve been peppering him with questions (Thanks, Don!).
I’ve also been writing code in C\# and F\#, and looking at the result in
Reflector so I can understand what’s happening. I certainly am not an
F\# expert by any stretch, but I do think I’m getting the hang of it.

Since I’ve reached this first plateau of getting it, I thought I’d write
out some of the things I like and don’t like about the language. This is
by no means an introduction to F\#. I’d recommend [Robert
Pickering’s](http://www.strangelights.com/)[Foundations of
F\#](http://www.apress.com/book/view/1590597575) book as well as Don’s
[Expert F\# book](http://www.apress.com/book/view/1590598504) (when it
comes out). You should also be reading [Luke
Hoban](http://blogs.msdn.com/lukeh)‘s and [Jomo
Fisher](http://blogs.msdn.com/jomo_fisher/)‘s blogs – they both just
joined the F\# team. C\# MVP Tomas Petricek has written several blog
posts introducing F\#, which he’s brought together in a [single
post](http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/tomasp/archive/2007/11/03/fsharp_introduction.aspx).
For an general overview of functional programming (the primary
programming paradigm of F\#), check out Slava Akhmechet’s [Functional
Programming For The Rest of
Us](http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html).

This turned into a fairly long post, so I split it out into a series
that I’ll post thru the end of the week.
