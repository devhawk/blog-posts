I&#8217;ve been getting into parsing again, and it turns out that functional pattern matching languages like F# are really good at text processing. After <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/01\/10\/Morning+Coffee+7.aspx\">claiming<\/a> I&#8217;d learn F# this year, then <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/02\/06\/Morning+Coffee+25.aspx\">abandoning the effort<\/a> to learn Powershell, I went back to F#. Nothing against PowerShell &#8211; I&#8217;ve moved over to using it as my primary command line shell and have tricked out my startup script and everything. But I haven&#8217;t found much need to code in it lately. <\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a .NET ninja guru, you owe it to yourself to take a long look at F#, if for no other reason to expand your mind. It takes a while to get used to. <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/dsyme\/\">Don Syme<\/a> (aka father of F#) can attest I&#8217;ve been peppering him with questions (Thanks, Don!). I&#8217;ve also been writing code in C# and F#, and looking at the result in Reflector so I can understand what&#8217;s happening. I certainly am not an F# expert by any stretch, but I do think I&#8217;m getting the hang of it.<\/p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;ve reached this first plateau of getting it, I thought I&#8217;d write out some of the things I like and don&#8217;t like about the language. This is by no means an introduction to F#. I&#8217;d recommend <a href=\"http:\/\/www.strangelights.com\/\">Robert Pickering&#8217;s<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.apress.com\/book\/view\/1590597575\">Foundations of F#<\/a> book as well as Don&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apress.com\/book\/view\/1590598504\">Expert F# book<\/a> (when it comes out). You should also be reading <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/lukeh\">Luke Hoban<\/a>&#8216;s and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/jomo_fisher\/\">Jomo Fisher<\/a>&#8216;s blogs &#8211; they both just joined the F# team. C# MVP Tomas Petricek has written several blog posts introducing F#, which he&#8217;s brought together in a <a href=\"http:\/\/cs.hubfs.net\/blogs\/tomasp\/archive\/2007\/11\/03\/fsharp_introduction.aspx\">single post<\/a>. For an general overview of functional programming (the primary programming paradigm of F#), check out Slava Akhmechet&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.defmacro.org\/ramblings\/fp.html\">Functional Programming For The Rest of Us<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This turned into a fairly long post, so I split it out into a series that I&#8217;ll post thru the end of the week. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/11\/28\/F+Hawkeye+Functional+Programming.aspx\">Functional Programming<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/11\/29\/F+Hawkeye+Pattern+Matching.aspx\">Pattern Matching<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/11\/29\/F+Hawkeye+Type+Inference.aspx\">Type Inference<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/11\/30\/F+Hawkeye+Assorted+Goodness.aspx\">Assorted Goodness<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/11\/30\/F+Hawkeye+Assorted+NotSoGoodness.aspx\">Assorted Not-So-Goodness<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>UPDATE &#8211; added link to Tomas Petricek&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/cs.hubfs.net\/blogs\/tomasp\/archive\/2007\/11\/03\/fsharp_introduction.aspx\">F# Introduction<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>(Harry is @ DevTeach in Vancounver with his family this week.
