<p><em>(Harry is @ DevTeach in Vancounver with his family this week. He was hoping to still do Morning Coffee posts, but that's turned out to be infeasible. So instead, you get a series of pre-written posts about F#.)</em></p><p>I've been spending some real quality time with F# of late. I've been getting into parsing again, and it turns out that functional pattern matching languages like F# are really good at text processing. After <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/10/Morning+Coffee+7.aspx">claiming</a> I'd learn F# this year, then <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/06/Morning+Coffee+25.aspx">abandoning the effort</a> to learn Powershell, I went back to F#. Nothing against PowerShell - I've moved over to using it as my primary command line shell and have tricked out my startup script and everything. But I haven't found much need to code in it lately. </p><p>If you're a .NET ninja guru, you owe it to yourself to take a long look at F#, if for no other reason to expand your mind. It takes a while to get used to. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/">Don Syme</a> (aka father of F#) can attest I've been peppering him with questions (Thanks, Don!). I've also been writing code in C# and F#, and looking at the result in Reflector so I can understand what's happening. I certainly am not an F# expert by any stretch, but I do think I'm getting the hang of it.</p><p>Since I've reached this first plateau of getting it, I thought I'd write out some of the things I like and don't like about the language. This is by no means an introduction to F#. I'd recommend <a href="http://www.strangelights.com/">Robert Pickering's</a><a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1590597575">Foundations of F#</a> book as well as Don's <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1590598504">Expert F# book</a> (when it comes out). You should also be reading <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lukeh">Luke Hoban</a>'s and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jomo_fisher/">Jomo Fisher</a>'s blogs - they both just joined the F# team. C# MVP Tomas Petricek has written several blog posts introducing F#, which he's brought together in a <a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/tomasp/archive/2007/11/03/fsharp_introduction.aspx">single post</a>. For an general overview of functional programming (the primary programming paradigm of F#), check out Slava Akhmechet's <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html">Functional Programming For The Rest of Us</a>.</p><p>This turned into a fairly long post, so I split it out into a series that I'll post thru the end of the week. </p><ul><li><a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/11/28/F+Hawkeye+Functional+Programming.aspx">Functional Programming</a></li><li><a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/11/29/F+Hawkeye+Pattern+Matching.aspx">Pattern Matching</a></li><li><a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/11/29/F+Hawkeye+Type+Inference.aspx">Type Inference</a></li><li><a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/11/30/F+Hawkeye+Assorted+Goodness.aspx">Assorted Goodness</a></li><li><a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/11/30/F+Hawkeye+Assorted+NotSoGoodness.aspx">Assorted Not-So-Goodness</a></li></ul><p>UPDATE - added link to Tomas Petricek's <a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/tomasp/archive/2007/11/03/fsharp_introduction.aspx">F# Introduction</a></p>
