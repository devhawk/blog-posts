-   As I predicted yesterday, Microsoft
    [announced](http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/20/joystiq-live-from-the-microsoft-gdc-keynote/)
    that “For the first time, community games will be distributed
    through Xbox Live.” I haven’t seen a press release yet, but it looks
    like this will allow any XNA developer to publish on XBL. Joystiq
    has a [few
    details](http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/20/gdc08-microsoft-announces-community-arcade/).
    According to [Major
    Nelson](http://twitter.com/majornelson/statuses/736089232), six
    community games will be available on XBL later today. Also, it looks
    like you’ll be able to make XNA games for [your Zune as
    well](http://twitter.com/majornelson/statuses/736095762). Details to
    follow.
-   Speaking of yesterday, I
    [referred](http://devhawk.net/2008/02/19/Morning+Coffee+147.aspx) to
    President Bush as “President 30% Approval”. This was incorrect. From
    now on, I’ll refer to him as “[President 19%
    Approval](http://americanresearchgroup.com/economy/)“.
-   Speaking of politics, two more [big wins for
    Obama](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23232655/) yesterday. The Clinton
    camp, looking more desperate every day, unveiled a [new
    website](http://www.delegatehub.com/) purporting to provide the
    “facts and myths about the race for delegates”. Memo to HRC:
    “Florida and Michigan should count” isn’t a fact, it’s an opinion. I
    can’t see how this site helps her cause.
-   Joel on Software, who used to work on the Excel team, provides a
    [facinating
    look](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/02/19.html) into why
    the Office File Formats are so complicated. Nothing more to add, I
    just thought it was an interesting discussion of “real-world”
    complications to something that seems like it should be simpler.
-   Scott Guthrie provides a [client product post .NET 3.5
    roadmap](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/19/net-3-5-client-product-roadmap.aspx),
    much like he did for [web
    products](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/29/net-web-product-roadmap-asp-net-silverlight-iis7.aspx)
    a few months ago. Unlike the web roadmap, which includes exciting
    stuff like Silverlight 2.0, IIS 7.0 and ASP.NET Extensions
    (including MVC), the client roadmap includes: better setup, better
    perf for WPF, better memory utilization and startup time, WPF
    designer improvements, and some new WPF control. Color me under
    whelmed.
-   My old team recently launched the [Software + Services Architecture
    Center](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa699384.aspx).
    S+S guru Gianpaolo Carraro [recently
    wrote](http://blogs.msdn.com/gianpaolo/archive/2008/02/15/s-s-architecture-site-on-msdn.aspx)
    about the different perspectives this new site is trying cater to.
    S+S hasn’t been on my personal radar, but it’s something I really
    would like to dig more into.
-   In a [recent charity hockey
    game](http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/02/18/longest-game.html?ref=rss),
    Team Cure beat Team Hope 2,250 to 2,223. No, that’s not a typo. The
    two teams of twenty faced off for *240 straight hours* of hockey in
    sub-zero weather to raise \$300,000 for cancer research. That’s
    frakking dedication to a cause.
