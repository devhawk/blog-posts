<ul><li>As I predicted yesterday, Microsoft <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/20/joystiq-live-from-the-microsoft-gdc-keynote/">announced</a> that "For the first time, community games will be distributed through Xbox Live." I haven't seen a press release yet, but it looks like this will allow any XNA developer to publish on XBL. Joystiq has a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/20/gdc08-microsoft-announces-community-arcade/">few details</a>. According to <a href="http://twitter.com/majornelson/statuses/736089232">Major Nelson</a>, six community games will be available on XBL later today. Also, it looks like you'll be able to make XNA games for <a href="http://twitter.com/majornelson/statuses/736095762">your Zune as well</a>. Details to follow. </li><li>Speaking of yesterday, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/02/19/Morning+Coffee+147.aspx">referred</a> to President Bush as "President 30% Approval". This was incorrect. From now on, I'll refer to him as "<a href="http://americanresearchgroup.com/economy/">President 19% Approval</a>".  </li><li>Speaking of politics, two more <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23232655/">big wins for Obama</a> yesterday. The Clinton camp, looking more desperate every day, unveiled a <a href="http://www.delegatehub.com/">new website</a> purporting to provide the "facts and myths about the race for delegates". Memo to HRC: "Florida and Michigan should count" isn't a fact, it's an opinion. I can't see how this site helps her cause.  </li><li>Joel on Software, who used to work on the Excel team, provides a <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/02/19.html">facinating look</a> into why the Office File Formats are so complicated. Nothing more to add, I just thought it was an interesting discussion of "real-world" complications to something that seems like it should be simpler.  </li><li>Scott Guthrie provides a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/19/net-3-5-client-product-roadmap.aspx">client product post .NET 3.5 roadmap</a>, much like he did for <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/29/net-web-product-roadmap-asp-net-silverlight-iis7.aspx">web products</a> a few months ago. Unlike the web roadmap, which includes exciting stuff like Silverlight 2.0, IIS 7.0 and ASP.NET Extensions (including MVC), the client roadmap includes: better setup, better perf for WPF, better memory utilization and startup time, WPF designer improvements, and some new WPF control. Color me under whelmed. </li><li>My old team recently launched the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa699384.aspx">Software + Services Architecture Center</a>. S+S guru Gianpaolo Carraro <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gianpaolo/archive/2008/02/15/s-s-architecture-site-on-msdn.aspx">recently wrote</a> about the different perspectives this new site is trying cater to. S+S hasn't been on my personal radar, but it's something I really would like to dig more into. </li><li>In a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/02/18/longest-game.html?ref=rss">recent charity hockey game</a>, Team Cure beat Team Hope 2,250 to 2,223. No, that's not a typo. The two teams of twenty faced off for <u><em>240 straight hours</em></u> of hockey in sub-zero weather to raise $300,000 for cancer research. That's frakking dedication to a cause.</li></ul>
