Joystiq has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joystiq.com\/2008\/02\/20\/gdc08-microsoft-announces-community-arcade\/\">few details<\/a>. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/majornelson\/statuses\/736089232\">Major Nelson<\/a>, six community games will be available on XBL later today. Also, it looks like you&#8217;ll be able to make XNA games for <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/majornelson\/statuses\/736095762\">your Zune as well<\/a>. Details to follow. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of yesterday, I <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2008\/02\/19\/Morning+Coffee+147.aspx\">referred<\/a> to President Bush as &#8220;President 30% Approval&#8221;. This was incorrect. From now on, I&#8217;ll refer to him as &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/americanresearchgroup.com\/economy\/\">President 19% Approval<\/a>&#8220;.  <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of politics, two more <a href=\"http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/23232655\/\">big wins for Obama<\/a> yesterday. The Clinton camp, looking more desperate every day, unveiled a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.delegatehub.com\/\">new website<\/a> purporting to provide the &#8220;facts and myths about the race for delegates&#8221;. Memo to HRC: &#8220;Florida and Michigan should count&#8221; isn&#8217;t a fact, it&#8217;s an opinion. I can&#8217;t see how this site helps her cause.  <\/li>\n<li>Joel on Software, who used to work on the Excel team, provides a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joelonsoftware.com\/items\/2008\/02\/19.html\">facinating look<\/a> into why the Office File Formats are so complicated. Nothing more to add, I just thought it was an interesting discussion of &#8220;real-world&#8221; complications to something that seems like it should be simpler.  <\/li>\n<li>Scott Guthrie provides a <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2008\/02\/19\/net-3-5-client-product-roadmap.aspx\">client product post .NET 3.5 roadmap<\/a>, much like he did for <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2007\/11\/29\/net-web-product-roadmap-asp-net-silverlight-iis7.aspx\">web products<\/a> a few months ago. Unlike the web roadmap, which includes exciting stuff like Silverlight 2.0, IIS 7.0 and ASP.NET Extensions (including MVC), the client roadmap includes: better setup, better perf for WPF, better memory utilization and startup time, WPF designer improvements, and some new WPF control. Color me under whelmed. <\/li>\n<li>My old team recently launched the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/architecture\/aa699384.aspx\">Software + Services Architecture Center<\/a>. S+S guru Gianpaolo Carraro <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/gianpaolo\/archive\/2008\/02\/15\/s-s-architecture-site-on-msdn.aspx\">recently wrote<\/a> about the different perspectives this new site is trying cater to. S+S hasn&#8217;t been on my personal radar, but it&#8217;s something I really would like to dig more into. <\/li>\n<li>In a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/sports\/hockey\/story\/2008\/02\/18\/longest-game.html?ref=rss\">recent charity hockey game<\/a>, Team Cure beat Team Hope 2,250 to 2,223. No, that&#8217;s not a typo. The two teams of twenty faced off for <u><em>240 straight hours<\/em><\/u> of hockey in sub-zero weather to raise $300,000 for cancer research. That&#8217;s frakking dedication to a cause.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>As I predicted yesterday, Microsoft announced that &#8220;For the first time, community games will be distributed through Xbox Live.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t seen a press release yet, but it looks like this will allow any XNA developer to publish on XBL.
