<p>Is it <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a14e76e5-0269-4fbf-854f-ce2f1178fc51">obvious</a> that I&#8217;ve been rounding up bloggers on my extended team of architects and architect evangelists? Here&#8217;s another: Raj Wall <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rajwall/archive/2004/07/23/193598.aspx">blogged</a>&nbsp;the first of what appears to be several posts about Patterns of Successful Software Projects. I like this as it really starts to expand the idea of what is a pattern. If you look at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/entarch.asp">EASOT</a>, you&#8217;ll notice a &#8220;Development Architecture Viewpoint&#8221; that has the following description:</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"><p>The development architecture viewpoint is concerned with implementing the other architectures. Applications must be built and maintained in a systematic, efficient manner. The development architecture is composed of elements related to this effort, such as design and development tools, repositories, build master utilities, test suites, tracking tools, and other tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">In my <a href="http://theserverside.net/talks/library.tss#HarryPierson">TheServerSide.net Tech Talk</a>, I pointed out that Test Driven Development is a pattern. I know there are a lot more development architecture patterns. Raj&#8217;s post starts to define the terms in this area of the pattern space. Can&#8217;t wait to see what Raj has to say about project context &#8211; the more I work with patterns, the more important I realize context is. </p>
