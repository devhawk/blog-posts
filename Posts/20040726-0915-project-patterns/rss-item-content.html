<p>Is it <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a14e76e5-0269-4fbf-854f-ce2f1178fc51">obvious</a> that I've been rounding up bloggers on my extended team of architects and architect evangelists? Here's another: Raj Wall <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rajwall/archive/2004/07/23/193598.aspx">blogged</a> the first of what appears to be several posts about Patterns of Successful Software Projects. I like this as it really starts to expand the idea of what is a pattern. If you look at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/entarch.asp">EASOT</a>, you'll notice a “Development Architecture Viewpoint” that has the following description:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>The development architecture viewpoint is concerned with implementing the other architectures. Applications must be built and maintained in a systematic, efficient manner. The development architecture is composed of elements related to this effort, such as design and development tools, repositories, build master utilities, test suites, tracking tools, and other tools.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">In my <a href="http://theserverside.net/talks/library.tss#HarryPierson">TheServerSide.net Tech Talk</a>, I pointed out that Test Driven Development is a pattern. I know there are a lot more development architecture patterns. Raj's post starts to define the terms in this area of the pattern space. Can't wait to see what Raj has to say about project context - the more I work with patterns, the more important I realize context is. </p>
