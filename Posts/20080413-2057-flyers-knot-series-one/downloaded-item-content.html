<p>Ever hear the phrase &#8220;if you don&#8217;t have anything nice to say, then don&#8217;t say anything at all&#8221;? That&#8217;s about how I feel about the Caps effort in <a href="http://www2.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=132&season=20072008&gameType=3">this afternoon&#8217;s loss</a> to the Flyers. </p>
<p>There are two possible explanations for today&#8217;s game:</p>
<ol>
<li>After going 11-1 to finish the season and coming from behind in the third period of <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/04/12/Caps+Win+Game+One+With+A+Three+Goal+Third.aspx">game one</a>, the Caps were just emotionally drained and couldn&#8217;t get up for today&#8217;s game.</li>
<li>The Flyers have figured out how to shut the Caps down completely. </li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I think it&#8217;s explanation #1. If it&#8217;s #2, it&#8217;s gonna be a short series.</p>
<p>I had written a bunch of observations, but go <a href="http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2008/04/game-2-recap-flyers-2-caps-0.html">read Japers instead</a>. He hit all the points I was going to and more. </p>
<p>Update &#8211; I almost forgot, good to see Patrick Thoresen (the Flyer who took a Mike Green Slapshot to the groin Friday) <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3343675">wasn&#8217;t as seriously hurt</a> as initially thought. </p>
