Ever hear the phrase “if you don’t have anything nice to say, then don’t
say anything at all”? That’s about how I feel about the Caps effort in
[this afternoon’s
loss](http://www2.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=132&season=20072008&gameType=3)
to the Flyers.

There are two possible explanations for today’s game:

1.  After going 11-1 to finish the season and coming from behind in the
    third period of [game
    one](http://devhawk.net/2008/04/12/Caps+Win+Game+One+With+A+Three+Goal+Third.aspx),
    the Caps were just emotionally drained and couldn’t get up for
    today’s game.
2.  The Flyers have figured out how to shut the Caps down completely.

Personally, I think it’s explanation \#1. If it’s \#2, it’s gonna be a
short series.

I had written a bunch of observations, but go [read Japers
instead](http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2008/04/game-2-recap-flyers-2-caps-0.html).
He hit all the points I was going to and more.

Update – I almost forgot, good to see Patrick Thoresen (the Flyer who
took a Mike Green Slapshot to the groin Friday) [wasn’t as seriously
hurt](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3343675)
as initially thought.
