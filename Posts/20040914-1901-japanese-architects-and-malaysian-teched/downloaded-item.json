(which was in turn followed by a flight to Kuala Lumpur which is why I&#8217;m not posting this until now). In my first year on the job, I focused on the &#8220;basics&#8221; which included helping improve <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\">Architecture Center<\/a> and handling the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/seminar\/teched2004\/default.mspx\">TechEd<\/a> Architecture Track. As part of that focus, I spent little time worrying about globalization issues. Not that they aren&#8217;t important, I just didn&#8217;t have the bandwidth to handle it. Now that we have worked through the basics, plus it&#8217;s now &#8220;we&#8221; and not just &#8220;me&#8221;, we can start to have some focus on better globalization support. For example, there&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/japan\/msdn\/architecture\/\">Japanese Architecture Center<\/a> that needs to have the same content as the MSDN site. Machine translation may have come a long way, but there&#8217;s still longer to go. Given the massive number of characters in eastern languages, machine translation to English works pretty well &#8211; here&#8217;s the <a href=\"http:\/\/babelfish.altavista.com\/babelfish\/trurl_pagecontent?url=http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/japan\/msdn\/architecture&amp;lp=ja_en\">Japanese Architecture Center in English<\/a> (translated by <a href=\"http:\/\/babelfish.altavista.com\/\">Babelfish<\/a>). However, translating to Japanese (or other eastern languages) is much much more difficult. <\/p>\n<p>Like several other MSFT subsidiaries, Japan has someone responsible for broad reach architecture &#8211; i.e. architect with a lower case &#8220;a&#8221; &#8211; so we spent most of our time discussing plans and figuring out how best to leverage each other. I was really impressed how deep these guys were on Software Factories and modeling already &#8211; they had a session on Software Factories at the TechEd Japan last week! <\/p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m in Kuala Lumpur for TechEd Malaysia. I&#8217;m presenting the Data in SOA talk today and Metropolis tomorrow as part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/malaysia\/events\/teched\/breakoutsessions.htm#7\">Architecture track<\/a>. I had breakfast with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/malaysia\/events\/teched\/softwarelegends.htm\">Software Legend<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.interknowlogy.com\/IKCorporate\/AboutUs\/CompanyExecutives\/TimothyHuckaby.htm\">Tim Huckaby<\/a> who I met the first time two years ago at TechEd Malaysia. My teammate Gurpreet just showed me the deck for his Enterprise Architecture talk he&#8217;s presenting in about 30 minutes. He&#8217;s also doing a presentation tomorrow on Microsoft Architecture Vision &amp; Direction. The EA deck is pretty good and the Vision &amp; Direction talk is something he&#8217;s been working on for several months, so I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing both of these. We&#8217;re working on the next release of <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/overview\/series\/\">The Architecture Strategy Series<\/a> and I&#8217;m thinking these talks should be included.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>After spending Monday morning exploring Shunjuku, I had meetings and dinner with the local architect evangelists followed Tuesday morning by a meeting with the local evangelism lead.
