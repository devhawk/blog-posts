<p>Has it been a slow week for everyone, or just me my first week back from vacation?</p><ul><li>I got email last night from Pat Helland - he's re-taking the red pill. He starts in the developer division on Monday. He asked for my help getting is <a href="http://www.pathelland.com/">website</a> up to date, so look for that in the near future. In the meantime, revisit some of Pat's hits: <a href="http://www.pathelland.com/presentations/2004/powerpoint/040528-Helland-05-28-2004-02a.ppt">Metropolis</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954587.aspx">Data on the Inside vs. Data on the Outside</a>, <a href="javascript:ShowWindow('http://msdn.microsoft.com/seminar/shared/asp/view.asp?url=/architecture/media/en/nerdsuitfortune/manifest.xml ');">The Nerd, the Suit, and the Fortune Teller</a> and his greatest hit <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=11950">Mr. CIO Guy</a>.</li><li>The new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=51a5c65b-c020-4e08-8ac0-3eb9c06996f4&amp;DisplayLang=en">4.0 version</a> of the Visual Studio 2005 SDK is out. Details on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jameslau/archive/2007/03/01/vs-2005-sdk-4-0-rtm-is-here.aspx">James' vs.Eco blog</a>.</li><li>Next week is the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developers Conference</a>. About a month ago, Dave Weller wrote that he had "<a href="http://letskilldave.com/archive/2007/02/05/Amazing-XNA-game-video_2E002E002E00_.aspx">been busy</a>" and the XNA <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/">team blog</a> has also been fairly silent. I have no inside information on this, but given that last years GDC was the first time we showed managed code running on an Xbox 360, the time is nigh for XNA announcements.</li></ul>
