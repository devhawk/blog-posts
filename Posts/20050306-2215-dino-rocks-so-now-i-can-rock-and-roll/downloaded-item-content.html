<p>Last weekend, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/DIY+Car+Radio+Harder+Than+I+Thought.aspx">tried in vain</a> to install a <a href="http://www.pie.net/index-2-details.cfm?recordID=GM9-AUX">PIE GM9-AUX</a> in my Chevy Blazer. The GM9-AUX converts the CD changer port on the stock CD player that came in the car to a standard RCA jack, which I can plug any one of my four <a href="http://nomadworld.com">Nomad</a> media players into (though I imaging 99.9% of the time, it will be the Zen Micro) via a standard miniplug to RCA adapter cable. This weekend, my neighbor Dino helped out and we got it installed. He did most of the dashboard removal work and I did the cable installtion and threading it thru the dashboard to somewhere accessable from the driver seat. Thanks Dino!</p>
