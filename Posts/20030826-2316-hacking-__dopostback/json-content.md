It started as a weblog entry describing an issue with the way ASP.NET’s
\_\_doPostBack method. Basically, the \_\_doPostBack method doesn’t fire
the form’s onsubmit event. But as I was writing the entry, I built a
module that worked around the issue. So I posted the issue and the fix
as an [article](art_submitfirefixup.aspx) and [source
code](articles/SubmitFireFixupModule.zip).
