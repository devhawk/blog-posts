<p>It started as a weblog entry describing an issue with the way ASP.NET&#8217;s __doPostBack method. Basically, the __doPostBack method doesn&#8217;t fire the form&#8217;s onsubmit event. But as I was writing the entry, I built a module that worked around the issue. So I posted the issue and the fix as an <a href="art_submitfirefixup.aspx">article</a> and <a href="articles/SubmitFireFixupModule.zip">source code</a>.</p>
