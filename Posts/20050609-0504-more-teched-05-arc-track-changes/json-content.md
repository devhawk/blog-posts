As per yesterday’s update, here are the latest changes to the ARC track
for those in Orlando

-   ARC304R – We’re repeating the [Smart Client
    Architecture](http://www1.msteched.com/content/sessionview.aspx?TopicID=8d2bce0e-9627-423a-9f41-8f6ed5b67bec)
    talk Thursday at 5pm in room S 220 E. Note, this repeat session will
    only feature [Billy Hollis](http://www.dotnetmasters.com/) as the
    speaker.
-   GAT Lab – Due to technical difficulties, the [Guidance Automation
    Toolkit](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/gat/) lab
    didn’t make it to the HoL floor. However, you can [download the
    lab](http://guidanceautomation.net/cs/library/View.aspx?tab=3&Id=40)
    from the brand new [GAT community
    site](http://www.guidanceautomation.net/). In addition to
    [blogs](http://www.guidanceautomation.net/blogs),
    [forums](http://www.guidanceautomation.net/forums) and a
    [wiki](http://www.guidanceautomation.net/wiki),
    [GuidanceAutomation.net](http://www.guidanceautomation.net/) features
    a [library](http://www.guidanceautomation.net/library) where you can
    find and share GAT resources – including the TechEd Lab – with other
    members of the community.

**Update**: Updated link to the GAT Lab.
