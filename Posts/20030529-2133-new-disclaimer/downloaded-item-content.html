<p>Observant readers who view my site in HTML rather than just reading the RSS feed may have noticed I&#8217;ve added a <a href="default.aspx#disclaimer">disclaimer</a> to my site. What a coincidence, it&#8217;s very similar to the disclaimer other Microsoft employees use when they post on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/newsgroups/"> newsgroups</a>.</p>
