<p>I was so excited to see the Dennis Miller's <a href="http://www.hbo.com/events/dmiller/">latest HBO special</a>, but it was such let down. He spent the first half sucking wind and the second half sucking up to the Republicans. I mean, he used to have such a sharp policital wit, but now he's just another partisan hack. It's pretty sad. </p><p>At least <a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/">Bill Maher</a> is back next week. </p>
