  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If Dennis Miller was critical of both democrats and republicans, then I wouldn't consider him a partisan hack. But when you repurpose Karl Rove's talking points into unfunny jokes, that makes you a partisan hack in my book. Even with the massive amount of corruption and ineptitude in this administration as fodder, the best Dennis could come up with was to make fun of John Kerry and Howard Dean in the presidential election from two years ago. Calling President "Sit For Seven Minutes While My Country Is Under Attack" Bush "decisive might be funny, if it wasn't so sad.

However, I do have to give Dennis small props for coming out in favor of gay marriage. 

As for Bill Maher, one of the reasons I like him is because he frequently criticizes both sides of the aisle. Of course, if you watched him, you'd know that.
