I was so excited to see the Dennis Miller’s [latest HBO
special](http://www.hbo.com/events/dmiller/), but it was such let down.
He spent the first half sucking wind and the second half sucking up to
the Republicans. I mean, he used to have such a sharp policital wit, but
now he’s just another partisan hack. It’s pretty sad.

At least [Bill Maher](http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/) is back next week.
