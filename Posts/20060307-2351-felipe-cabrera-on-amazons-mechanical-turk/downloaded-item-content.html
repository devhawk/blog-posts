<p>Felipe&#8217;s a good guy (I knew him when he was at MSFT) but this session wasn&#8217;t anything exciting because it&#8217;s all old news. There are some things humans are better at than computers, typically things involving judgment such as &#8220;which is the best picture of this store?&#8221; Yes, I saw that when Amazon first released <a href="http://www.mturk.com">Mechanical Turk</a>.</p>
<p>They did have a partner on stage, a company called <a href="http://castingwords.com/">Casting Words</a> that offers podcast transcription services for 42 cents a minute. But how is that a business? I&#8217;m not sure what kind of percentage Casting Words is making out of that 42 cents a minute, but couldn&#8217;t I go directly to Mechanical Turk and ask for transcription services myself? There are no Casting Words tasks <a href="http://www.mturk.com/mturk/findhits">currently on the site</a> as I type this, but I imagine if I watch a while I&#8217;ll see a Casting Words task. Then I could simply use a site like <a href="http://www.hit-builder.com/">HIT Builder</a> to farm out my own transcription tasks. What&#8217;s my incentive to use Casting Words at all? </p>
<p>Furthermore, there&#8217;s not really a business model behind Mechanical Turk itself. If Microsoft launched its own version, there would be plenty of takers for that work as well &#8211; the workers will gravitate to where the best paying and most interesting work they can do is. There&#8217;s no incentive to provide your artificial artificial intelligence services exclusively to one company. So Mechanical Turk wouldn&#8217;t work as a stand alone business. But as a feature of Amazon it works great. In fact, when the service first launched the only tasks came from <a href="http://a9.com">A9</a>. I&#8217;m guessing it would be worth it to Amazon to run the service even if they were the only ones using it.</p>
