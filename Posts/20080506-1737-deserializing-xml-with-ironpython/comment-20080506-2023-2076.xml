  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[@Bryant, XDocument + LINQ is a HUGE improvement over XmlDocument. But support for late binding is what makes the Python version so much more readable. 

@Seo, Don't worry, I plan to take a very long look at FePy. Just haven't had the time yet. 

As for my code, it's more about me learning Python not really about providing a definitive solution to any specific problem. I think xml2py could be tweaked to support pulldom with little effort. I just know .NET FX very well, so it's easier for me to focus on learning the language with a library I know then it is to learn the language and library at the same time. 

Thanks for the link to lxml.objectify. I'll take a look at that too. I figure there must be other (and better) libraries out there that do something similar to xml2py. ]]></wp:comment_content>
