It&#8217;s my favorite so far. I&#8217;m not sure if it was the new director, or just the fact that this book was longer than the first two, but I thought this movie spent far less time on stuff from the book that wasn&#8217;t relevant to the story. I took a film class back in high school, and the teacher explained that every scene in a movie has to do one of three things.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Advance the plot<\/li>\n<li>Advance the character<\/li>\n<li>Get a laugh<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I amended rule #3 to be \u201cGet a reaction\u201d since there are often scenes in a horror or thriller movie that are there just to scare you. The first two Harry Potter movies seemed to spend a significant amount of screen time on getting the reaction: \u201cI remember that from the book\u201d. For example, in the last movie, when Harry and Ron drink a potion to transform into Malfoy&#8217;s two henchmen (henchboys?) , Hermione accidentally transforms herself into a cat. The only reason that scene is in the movie is because it&#8217;s in the book. Not having Hermione doesn&#8217;t affect Harry and Ron&#8217;s mission (i.e. it didn&#8217;t advance the plot) nor was there any fallout or change to Hermione in later scenes (i.e. it didn&#8217;t advance the character). It doesn&#8217;t even get a laugh. Given the Harry Potter movies are around 2 1\/2 hours long each, there&#8217;s no excuse for extraneous scenes like this.<\/p>\n<p>Kill Bill Vol 2, Troy, Shrek 2 and Harry Potter so far with Spider-Man 2 and King Arthur on the horizon. Sure we&#8217;ve had Van Helsing and The Day After Tomorrow, but so far the summer movie season is looking good.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>My wife and I saw the latest Harry Potter movie over the weekend.
