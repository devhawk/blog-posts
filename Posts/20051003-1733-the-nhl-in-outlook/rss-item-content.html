<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/markhsch/default.aspx">Mark Schmidt</a> from the WWF team built a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/markhsch/archive/2005/09/27/474633.aspx">nifty little app</a> to import the NHL hockey schedule into Outlook. So I went to import the Caps schedule, only to find that the time zones don't match up. All the game times are in east coast time and I am on the west coast. I was going to bug Mark for the code, but decided instead to change my current timezone to east coast, import the games into Outlook, and then change my timezone back. It's a bit of a hack, but it was quicker than changing the code. Sometimes, simple is better.</p><p>Now, I just need <a href="http://www.comcast.com/">Comcast</a> to get <a href="http://www.hd.net/nhlinhd.html">HDNet</a>.</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: No word from Concast on getting HDNet. They hope to have more HD Channels "by the end of the year". I found a <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/comcast1/petition.html">petition online</a> asking for HDNet on Comcast and a <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000873024786/">blog entry</a> from Mark Cuban (co-owner of HDNet) that compares HDNet vs. InHD to "David vs. Goliath". InHD is owned in part, I think, by Comcast. However, Comcast now owns the broadcast rights to the NHL via their <a href="http://www.olntv.com/nw/article/view/1268/?tf=nwNHLArticle.tpl">OLN network</a>. So I'm hoping we'll eventually see HD NHL on Comcast, thought it sounds like I have to wait a few months. :(</p>
