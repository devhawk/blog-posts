I was looking up something on the
[VS.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio) site when I noticed a link
to [PowerToys for VS.NET 2003](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/ide). There
are currently 5 PowerToys available:

-   [VSTweak](http://apps.gotdotnet.com/ide/powertoys/vstweak.exe) –
    Allows you to modify some of the more obscure VS.NET options and
    settings
-   [VSEdit](http://apps.gotdotnet.com/ide/powertoys/vsedit.exe) –
    Command line tool to load a file into currently running instance of
    VS.NET
-   [VSWindowManager](http://apps.gotdotnet.com/ide/powertoys/VSWindowManager.exe)
    – Enables you to design your own custom window layouts
-   [Custom Help
    Builder](http://apps.gotdotnet.com/ide/powertoys/CustomHelpBuilder.exe)
    – allows you to create a custom help collection for your XML-style
    commented Visual Basic or Visual C\# class library. Integrates the
    custom help collection into the VS.NET help system
-   [VB
    Commenter](http://apps.gotdotnet.com/ide/powertoys/VBCommenter.exe)
    – XML-style comment tags for VB

Future tools include:

-   VSCMDShell Window – One window to access both the VS.NET Commands
    Window and your external CMD.exe process.
-   VSMouseBindings – Assign all five mouse buttons to commands within
    VS.NET
-   VSTransparency – Make floating windows and pop-up UI
    semi-transparent in the IDE giving you a better view of the code
    below

Sweet!
