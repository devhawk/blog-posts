From the morale perspective, it’s worth noting the voter turnout in the
primaries so far. Yesterdays’ Democratic Nevada primary is the third in
a row to [set turnout

On the Republican side, Benen [points
out](http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/14296.html) that
McCain won South Carolina yesterday with a 135,000 votes but eight years
ago, he got nearly 100,000 more votes in a losing effort. By my
calculation, Republican South Carolina turnout was 30% less than it was
in 2000.

Voter turnout in early primaries doesn’t make this election a sure thing
by any means, but it sure is an encouraging sign.
