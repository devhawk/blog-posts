<blockquote><p>You may have noticed, on bumpers or t-shirts, the &#8220;<a href="http://www.bushslastday.com/">1.20.09</a>&#8221; slogan. It denotes, of course, Inauguration Day for Bush&#8217;s successor.</p>
<p>I just thought I&#8217;d mention that after seven painful years, the Bush presidency will end exactly one year from today. It&#8217;s obviously something to look forward to.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an awkward period in Democratic politics right now &#8212; a contentious presidential primary, a frustrated Democratic Congress &#8212; but looking at the light at the end of the tunnel, and knowing it&#8217;s probably not a train, might serve as a morale booster.</p>

<p>From the morale perspective, it&#8217;s worth noting the voter turnout in the primaries so far. Yesterdays&#8217; Democratic Nevada primary is the third in a row to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/us/politics/19cnd-dems.html">set turnout records</a>. On the Republican side, Benen <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/14296.html">points out</a> that McCain won South Carolina yesterday with a 135,000 votes but eight years ago, he got nearly 100,000 more votes in a losing effort. By my calculation, Republican South Carolina turnout was 30% less than it was in 2000. </p>
<p>Voter turnout in early primaries doesn&#8217;t make this election a sure thing by any means, but it sure is an encouraging sign. </p>
