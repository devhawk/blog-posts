<p>Does anyone know if there&#8217;s an RSS feed for <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net"> KurzweilAI.net</a>? I got a rare opportunity to hear him speak yesterday as part of a Microsoft event and he was amazing. (I wonder if he got more sleep than <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">Chris Anderson</a> did?) I&#8217;ve started on his book <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0140282025"> The Age of Spiritual Machines</a> (which I&#8217;ve had for a year and never found time for) and I was picking through the massive amount of information on his <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net">website</a>. But I want to keep up to date and an RSS feed is (obviously) the easiest way to do that.</p>
