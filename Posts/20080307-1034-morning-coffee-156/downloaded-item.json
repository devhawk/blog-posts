No points for me, but I was even on the night. I did spend some time in the penalty box, but I was serving a two many men on the ice bench minor. We only had nine skaters, not enough for two full lines, so I&#8217;m pretty tired today.

That&#8217;s significantly more than Clinton (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/bensmith\/0208\/Clinton_raises_35_million_in_February.html\">$35 million<\/a>) and McCain (<a href=\"http:\/\/politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com\/2008\/02\/29\/mccain-raises-12-million-in-january\/\">$12 million<\/a>) combined. Even more impressive is that $45 million of that was raised online, of which $40 million were from donations of $100 or less and $22.5 million were from donations of $25 or less. I guess in Politics 2.0, individuals contribute more than <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/CategoryView,category,Politics.aspx\">online punditry<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yjbknhX383A\">video parodies<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h7bzdj9RlG4\">political commercials<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.textglow.net\/\">TextGlow<\/a> is a Sivlerlight 2 based Word docx file viewer, <a href=\"http:\/\/james.newtonking.com\/archive\/2008\/03\/06\/silverlight-2-0-ooxml-textglow.aspx\">created by<\/a> James Newton-King.
