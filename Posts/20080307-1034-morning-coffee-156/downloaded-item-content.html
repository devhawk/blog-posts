<li>My hockey team won last night 4-2. No points for me, but I was even on the night. I did spend some time in the penalty box, but I was serving a two many men on the ice bench minor. We only had nine skaters, not enough for two full lines, so I&#8217;m pretty tired today. However, I&#8217;m not as tired as I was two weeks ago &#8211; that&#8217;s a good sign.  </li>
<li>Politics 2.0 watch: The Obama campain <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/samgrahamfelsen/gGB3YB">announced yesterday</a> that they raised $55 million in donations in the month of February. That&#8217;s significantly more than Clinton (<a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0208/Clinton_raises_35_million_in_February.html">$35 million</a>) and McCain (<a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/02/29/mccain-raises-12-million-in-january/">$12 million</a>) combined. Even more impressive is that $45 million of that was raised online, of which $40 million were from donations of $100 or less and $22.5 million were from donations of $25 or less. I guess in Politics 2.0, individuals contribute more than <a href="http://devhawk.net/CategoryView,category,Politics.aspx">online punditry</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbknhX383A">video parodies</a> of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7bzdj9RlG4">political commercials</a>.  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.textglow.net/">TextGlow</a> is a Sivlerlight 2 based Word docx file viewer, <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/archive/2008/03/06/silverlight-2-0-ooxml-textglow.aspx">created by</a> James Newton-King. Nice, but what I really want is &#8220;SlideGlow&#8221;, a SL2 based PPTX file viewer. (via <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/silverlight/Silverlight_2_0_OOXML_TextGlow">DNK</a>)  </li>
<li>Speaking of Silverlight, Windows Live launched an experimental site called <a href="http://photozoom.mslivelabs.com/">PhotoZoom</a> which will let you create DeepZoom photo albums. (via <a href="http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2008/03/07/microsoft-launches-photozoom-powered-by-silverlight-2-and-deepzoom.aspx">LiveSide</a>) </li>
<li>Charlie Calvert <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/03/05/future-focus-ii-call-hierarchy.aspx">has created</a> a home for <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vslangfutures/">Language Futures discussion</a> on MSDN Code Gallery. If you&#8217;ll recall, back in January he asked for input on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/01/25/future-focus.aspx">Dynamic Lookup</a>. Now he&#8217;s looking for feedback on <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vslangfutures/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Call%20Hierarchy&referringTitle=Home">Call Hierarchy</a>, a proposed VS IDE feature to help you visualize how your code flows. Great idea, but the <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vslangfutures/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Call%20Hierarchy&referringTitle=Home">Call Hierarchy dialog mockup</a> isn&#8217;t very intuitive. Couldn&#8217;t we put these visualizations into the code editor window directly, like <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/CodeRush/">CodeRush</a> does?  </li>
<li>John Lam continues his Dynamic Silverlight series, first building a <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-1.html">Flickr image browser in Managed JScript</a> then showing how to integrate an <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-2.html">IronRuby version of the Flickr image browser with an ASP.NET MVC app</a>.  </li>
