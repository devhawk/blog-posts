<p>After <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=30683">seeing it</a> on TSS.net, I checked out the <a href="http://www.x-develop.com/">X-develop</a> product website. X-develop is a new multi-language cross-platform IDE that supports both .NET languages like VB.NET, C# and J# as well as Java. It includes support for all the .NET 2.0 features like generics as well as new Java 5.0 features like generics, varargs, enums and boxing. </p>
<p>When I checked out the website, I noticed a section covering &#8220;<a href="http://www.x-develop.com/xdevelop_extend.htm">Custom Languages</a>&#8220;. Here&#8217;s another example of bias against DSLs &#8211; this time in favor of &#8220;full grown OO languages&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The [X-develop] language plugin API is not limited to toy languages or <i>little domain specific languages</i>. Instead it supports full grown OO languages. In fact the support for Java, C#, J# and Visual Basic.NET is implemented as language plugins.&#8221; (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of the same kind of bias that was leveled against classic VB. Classic VB was valuable primarily <i>because</i> it was limited in scope and capability. But what it gave up in capability it gained in productivity. Along the same lines, DSLs are valuable <em>because</em> they are little, because they only focus on a single problem domain.</p>
<p>What exactly would be the value of another &#8220;full-grown OO language&#8221;? What features would be in a new full grown language that isn&#8217;t already in Java/J#, C# or VB.NET? The only feature I can think of is dynamic language support such as <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/Type+Inference">type inference</a> and <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DuckTyping">duck typing</a> a la <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/">Boo</a>. What non-domain specific language features are you still waiting for?</p>
