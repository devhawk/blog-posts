X-develop is a new multi-language cross-platform IDE that supports both .NET languages like VB.NET, C# and J# as well as Java. It includes support for all the .NET 2.0 features like generics as well as new Java 5.0 features like generics, varargs, enums and boxing. <\/p>\n<p>When I checked out the website, I noticed a section covering &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.x-develop.com\/xdevelop_extend.htm\">Custom Languages<\/a>&#8220;. Here&#8217;s another example of bias against DSLs &#8211; this time in favor of &#8220;full grown OO languages&#8221;:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The [X-develop] language plugin API is not limited to toy languages or <i>little domain specific languages<\/i>. Instead it supports full grown OO languages. In fact the support for Java, C#, J# and Visual Basic.NET is implemented as language plugins.&#8221; (Emphasis added)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This reminds me of the same kind of bias that was leveled against classic VB. Classic VB was valuable primarily <i>because<\/i> it was limited in scope and capability. But what it gave up in capability it gained in productivity. Along the same lines, DSLs are valuable <em>because<\/em> they are little, because they only focus on a single problem domain.<\/p>\n<p>What exactly would be the value of another &#8220;full-grown OO language&#8221;? What features would be in a new full grown language that isn&#8217;t already in Java\/J#, C# or VB.NET? The only feature I can think of is dynamic language support such as <a href=\"http:\/\/boo.codehaus.org\/Type+Inference\">type inference<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/c2.com\/cgi\/wiki?DuckTyping\">duck typing<\/a> a la <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ruby-lang.org\/en\/\">Ruby<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/boo.codehaus.org\/\">Boo<\/a>. What non-domain specific language features are you still waiting for?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>After seeing it on TSS.net, I checked out the X-develop product website.
