<p>After <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=30683">seeing it</a> on TSS.net, I checked out the <a href="http://www.x-develop.com/">X-develop</a> product website. X-develop is a new multi-language cross-platform IDE that supports both .NET languages like VB.NET, C# and J# as well as Java. It includes support for all the .NET 2.0 features like generics as well as new Java 5.0 features like generics, varargs, enums and boxing. </p><p>When I checked out the website, I noticed a section covering "<a href="http://www.x-develop.com/xdevelop_extend.htm">Custom Languages</a>". Here's another example of bias against DSLs - this time in favor of "full grown OO languages":</p><blockquote><p>"The [X-develop] language plugin API is not limited to toy languages or <i>little domain specific languages</i>. Instead it supports full grown OO languages. In fact the support for Java, C#, J# and Visual Basic.NET is implemented as language plugins." (Emphasis added)</p></blockquote><p>This reminds me of the same kind of bias that was leveled against classic VB. Classic VB was valuable primarily <i>because</i> it was limited in scope and capability. But what it gave up in capability it gained in productivity. Along the same lines, DSLs are valuable <em>because</em> they are little, because they only focus on a single problem domain.</p><p>What exactly would be the value of another "full-grown OO language"? What features would be in a new full grown language that isn't already in Java/J#, C# or VB.NET? The only feature I can think of is dynamic language support such as <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/Type+Inference">type inference</a> and <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DuckTyping">duck typing</a> a la <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/">Boo</a>. What non-domain specific language features are you still waiting for?</p>
