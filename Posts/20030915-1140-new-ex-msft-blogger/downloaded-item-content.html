<p>My old teammate Rick Culpepper has <a href="http://rickculpepper.net/">started a blog</a>. He wanted to use my code for his site, but it&#8217;s such a complete mess at this point that he wisely chose to go the <a href="http://scottwater.com/DotText">.Text</a> route instead. He may not <i> think </i>he&#8217;s got anything interesting to blog about, but he&#8217;s one of the more interesting guys I know. Interesting enough that I wish he was still a borg and a teammate.
