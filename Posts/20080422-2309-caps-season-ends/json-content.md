I should be mad. Angry. Furious even.

The Capitals season ended tonight in large part due to what I think was
a horrific non call in the second period. The on-air commentators were
stunned that the officials allowed the goal after the Flyers Patrick
Toresen took Caps’ goaltender Huet out of the play by body checking
Shaone Morrison into him. Sami Kapanen had the whole net to shoot at and
didn’t miss. The NHL [quickly trotted out an ~~excuse~~
justification](http://dumpnchase.wordpress.com/2008/04/22/explanation-from-the-league/)
for the call, but what else are they going to say. “Yep, the officials
blew the call. It only decided game 7, no big deal”?

As I said, I should be pretty upset. Especially after what sounded like
a [poorly called game
four](http://dumpnchase.wordpress.com/2008/04/18/horse-hockey/) (no
comment from me – I didn’t see the game).

However, I can’t help but think back to the [last Friday in
November](http://devhawk.net/2007/11/24/Afternoon+Coffee+126.aspx) when
the Caps had the worst record in the league @ 6-14-1 and had just
promoted their minor league affiliate’s coach to the big leagues. If you
had told me then – almost exactly five months ago – that the Caps would
go 37-17-7 over the remaining 3/4ths of the season, win the division in
their last game and take battle back from a 3-1 series deficit to force
a game seven, I would have wondered what you were smoking.

This season has been a gift for Caps fans and I’ve relished the few
games I’ve gotten to see, even the one that sent us home.

Furthermore, even though they lost, these playoffs are a promise of
future success. I tell my kids all the time that the only way to get
good at something is to work hard while you’re bad at it. Playoff hockey
is no different. Most of the Caps had little or no playoff experience
going into this series and it really showed thru the first three games.
But they kept at it and played much better over the last four games of
the series. They went 2-2 in those games, but the two losses went to
overtime. A little more luck (or better officiating) and the Caps are
headed to Pittsburgh instead of the golf course. 

Speaking of Pittsburgh, look back at the Penguin’s performance in the
[playoffs last
year](http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=298734).
Like the Caps, Pittsburgh is loaded with young talent that were thin on
playoff experience. Also like the Caps, they went home after the first
round. However, unlike the Caps, they only managed one win against an
Ottawa team they had beaten three times down the stretch in the regular
season. Furthermore, when facing elimination, the Penguins [laid a goose
egg](http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=145&season=20062007&gameType=3).
However, as much as I hate to complement the Penguins, things are [very
different this year](http://www.nhl.com/cup/series/seriesb_index.html).
Here’s hoping the early playoff exit has a similar effect on the Caps.

Bumping around my music collection for a song that captured my mood, I
came across Getting Better from [Tesla’s debut
album](http://social.zune.net/AlbumDetails.aspx?aid=4f980a00-0100-11db-89ca-0019b92a3933).

> All that rain, outside my window\
> But I’ll live on I know\

> Soon the sun will shine, through my window\

Swapping “season” for “day” kills the rhythm and rhyme, but it captures
how I feel.

Thank you Washington Capitals for a great season. I look forward to many
more to come.

Thank you Bruce Boudreau for jumping in the deep end unafraid and
turning this season around.

Thanks you Washington fans for turning out in such force. Who would have
thought the Verizon Center would be considered “[most electric
arena](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3337943)“?

Finally, thank you to Ted Leonsis for enduring [the
criticism](http://devhawk.net/2004/02/19/Doing+The+Unthinkable.aspx),
for turning Washington DC into a hockey town and [for
ensuring](http://devhawk.net/2008/01/11/Superman+Signed.aspx) I’ll be
able to wear my \#8 Ovechkin jersey until [my
kids](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!2093.entry)
are in high school.
