<p>So now that my new weblog is up, I just need a way to post to it with ease. I started with a hidden page (since removed) that had an <a href="http://www.activeup.com/">ActiveUp</a><a href="http://www.activeup.com/products/components/htmltextbox/">Html TextBox</a> control on it. But I wanted more. I wanted to work offline. I wanted a better HTML editing experience. I wanted a rich HTML editor! Luckily, I have Front Page. I hacked up a macro to throw up a dialog to grab the entry title &amp; description, then insert that info + the currently selected text as the weblog entry content into the database. Of course, the true bummer is that I had to do it all with ADO. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_sad.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group1560" alt=":(">  Talk about spoiled. ADO.NET does a much better job handling parameters. What I need is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/developer/preview/default.asp">Office 11</a>, with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnofftalk/html/office01022003.asp"> Visual Studio Tools for Office</a>! Unfortunately, it appears that only Word and Excel are supported in VS.NET 2003, but I could use Word to blog instead of Front Page&#8230;</p>
