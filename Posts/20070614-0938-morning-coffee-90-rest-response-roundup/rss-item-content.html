<p>Last week, I asked <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/06/05/A+REST+Question.aspx">a REST Question</a>: is it still REST if you don't use HTTP? My interest in durable messaging is <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/30/The+Case+For+Durable+Messaging+In+Service+Orientation.aspx">well documented</a>, so I want is to see a RESTful approach combined with a durable messaging. We all know my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/10/23/The+Other+Foundation+Technology.aspx">durable messaging tool of choice</a>, though I'd trade SSB in a second for something that provided durable duplex messaging in a standard way.</p><p>Anyway, there were some fairly interesting responses that I wanted to highlight.</p><p>Probably most interesting to the discussion at hand was <a href="http://johnheintz.blogspot.com">John Heintz</a>' <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,87AE6135-942F-4476-9DD7-9992CF073A7A.aspx#f43c3ac6-f719-428d-b5f7-ce84ef8a707f">comment</a> pointing out the existence of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waka_%28protocol%29">Waka</a>",  a new transfer protocol to replace HTTP from Roy Fielding. The fact that Dr. REST is working on a new protocol that's designed to be more RESTful than HTTP should put to bed any REST "is and only is" HTTP arguments. </p><p>Erik Johnson agrees that you can separate REST and HTTP, but he <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,87AE6135-942F-4476-9DD7-9992CF073A7A.aspx#e80b80a3-bfdb-4615-8516-57193dfed280">thinks</a> I ought to call it something else. He <a href="http://appside.blogspot.com/2007/06/rest-over-http.html">suggests</a> "resource-oriented" - have we created a new TLA here? Are you down with ROA, ROAD, ROD, ROP and all the other acronyms we could spawn?</p><p>Nick Malik <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/06/what-is-the-rest-high-order-bit.aspx">breaks out</a> the IFaP acronym - Identifier, Format, Protocol - and points out "Each of the successful Internet standards, from HTTP to SMTP, has an IFaP at the heart of it." But does anyone think SMTP is RESTful? I don't. I think standardization of IFaP's is on par in importance with RESTfulness, but they're orthogonal. That is to say I think Nick's wrong - I'm guessing we'll go a few rounds on this when he gets back from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/12/showing-up-can-be-the-hardest-part.aspx">Nashville</a> - or should I say, <em>if</em> he gets back? :)</p><p>Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz <a href="http://www.ddj.com/blog/architectblog/archives/2007/06/devhawk_harry_p.html">has been wondering</a> about REST without HTTP the same way I have, but he doesn't really go into detail as to why. I want durable messaging, Arnon mentions something about topic hierarchies. Couldn't you do that with HTTP, Arnon? He also points out a <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/webservices/199902676">new DDJ article on REST</a>. It's good, if high-level overview-y.</p><p>Pat Helland <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/06/12/every-noun-can-be-verbed.aspx">writes</a> that Every Noun Can be Verbed. It's more related to <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/05/24/REST+Is+Neither+CRUD+Nor+CRAP.aspx">CRUD is CRAP</a> than REST == HTTP, but it's well worth the read. His point about using filling out a form being CRUD, but then handing the form over to someone else being an invocation of behavior is fairly eye-opening. As long as you "interpret the durn' things with the correct semantics", it doesn't really matter if they're nouns or verbs. </p><p>Last but not least, <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a> and Adrian Trenaman <a href="http://tssblog.techtarget.com/index.php/xmlweb-services/neward-and-trenaman-consider-rest-or-the-great-and-complete-soap-vs-pox-debate/">discuss SOAP vs. POX</a> over on The Server Side. They focus too much on SOAP encoding (isn't that dead yet?), but near the end Ted points out: "Problem is, REST assumes that you want to carry all of the state in the payload itself, and for a modern enterprise system, or, hell, even for a game, that’s not always a safe assumption." Doesn't address my questions about using REST without HTTP, but a very good point nonetheless.</p>
