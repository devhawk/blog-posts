The fact that Dr. REST is working on a new protocol that&#8217;s designed to be more RESTful than HTTP should put to bed any REST &#8220;is and only is&#8221; HTTP arguments. <\/p>\n<p>Erik Johnson agrees that you can separate REST and HTTP, but he <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/CommentView,guid,87AE6135-942F-4476-9DD7-9992CF073A7A.aspx#e80b80a3-bfdb-4615-8516-57193dfed280\">thinks<\/a> I ought to call it something else. He <a href=\"http:\/\/appside.blogspot.com\/2007\/06\/rest-over-http.html\">suggests<\/a> &#8220;resource-oriented&#8221; &#8211; have we created a new TLA here? Are you down with ROA, ROAD, ROD, ROP and all the other acronyms we could spawn?<\/p>\n<p>Nick Malik <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/nickmalik\/archive\/2007\/06\/06\/what-is-the-rest-high-order-bit.aspx\">breaks out<\/a> the IFaP acronym &#8211; Identifier, Format, Protocol &#8211; and points out &#8220;Each of the successful Internet standards, from HTTP to SMTP, has an IFaP at the heart of it.&#8221; But does anyone think SMTP is RESTful? I don&#8217;t. I think standardization of IFaP&#8217;s is on par in importance with RESTfulness, but they&#8217;re orthogonal. That is to say I think Nick&#8217;s wrong &#8211; I&#8217;m guessing we&#8217;ll go a few rounds on this when he gets back from <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/nickmalik\/archive\/2007\/06\/12\/showing-up-can-be-the-hardest-part.aspx\">Nashville<\/a> &#8211; or should I say, <em>if<\/em> he gets back? <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group987\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ddj.com\/blog\/architectblog\/archives\/2007\/06\/devhawk_harry_p.html\">has been wondering<\/a> about REST without HTTP the same way I have, but he doesn&#8217;t really go into detail as to why. I want durable messaging, Arnon mentions something about topic hierarchies. Couldn&#8217;t you do that with HTTP, Arnon? He also points out a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ddj.com\/dept\/webservices\/199902676\">new DDJ article on REST<\/a>. It&#8217;s good, if high-level overview-y.<\/p>\n<p>Pat Helland <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/pathelland\/archive\/2007\/06\/12\/every-noun-can-be-verbed.aspx\">writes<\/a> that Every Noun Can be Verbed. It&#8217;s more related to <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/05\/24\/REST+Is+Neither+CRUD+Nor+CRAP.aspx\">CRUD is CRAP<\/a> than REST == HTTP, but it&#8217;s well worth the read. His point about using filling out a form being CRUD, but then handing the form over to someone else being an\u00a0invocation of behavior is fairly eye-opening. As long as you &#8220;interpret the durn&#8217; things with the correct semantics&#8221;, it doesn&#8217;t really matter if they&#8217;re nouns or verbs. <\/p>\n<p>Last but not least, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.tedneward.com\/\">Ted Neward<\/a> and Adrian Trenaman <a href=\"http:\/\/tssblog.techtarget.com\/index.php\/xmlweb-services\/neward-and-trenaman-consider-rest-or-the-great-and-complete-soap-vs-pox-debate\/\">discuss SOAP vs. POX<\/a> over on The Server Side. They focus too much on SOAP encoding (isn&#8217;t that dead yet?), but near the end Ted points out: &#8220;Problem is, REST assumes that you want to carry all of the state in the payload itself, and for a modern enterprise system, or, hell, even for a game, that\u2019s not always a safe assumption.&#8221; Doesn&#8217;t address my questions about using REST without HTTP, but a\u00a0very good point nonetheless.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Last week, I asked\u00a0a REST Question: is it still REST if you don&#8217;t use HTTP?
