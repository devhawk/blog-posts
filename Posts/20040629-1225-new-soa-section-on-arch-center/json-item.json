I&#8217;m provisioning a new VPC to install it on. I&#8217;d love to move to VS2005 for all my dev work, but I&#8217;m writing a few apps that need to be working in a production environment long before we get to Beta 2, so I&#8217;m going to leave those on VS.NET 2003&#8230;at least for now. However, there are a few longer-term things that I&#8217;m working on that I&#8217;ve been wait to start coding on for VS2005 that can now get started.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">On the architecture side, we launched a <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/soa\">new SOA resource page<\/a>. As part of the launch, we are featuring an updated version of Pat&#8217;s Metropolis presentation and a new SOA whitepaper. The version of Metropolis that has been a part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/overview\/series\/\">Architecture Strategy Series<\/a> was one of the first times Pat had presented it. Like many presentations, Pat refined his delivery with each new time he delivered the talk. The new version provides a new section that describes SOA as well as a section drilling down on the guidance that the Metropolis model provides. Even if you&#8217;ve seen the previous version, you should check out the new version.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">We also published a new whitepaper on <a href=\"http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/d\/2\/5\/d2513e64-0dcd-4ef6-89c4-c99ee117936f\/serviceorientationwpa4.doc\">Service Orientation and Its Role in Your Connected Systems Strategy<\/a>. It takes a Crawl\/Walk\/Run approach to describing the approach and technology for service orientation today, next year with SQL 2005 &amp; VS 2005, and further out with Longhorn and Indigo. It also covers such areas as Service-Oriented Analysis, Designing for Change and Extensibility, Service Management and Pattern of Service-Oriented Solutions.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">You can discuss the new whitepaper, the new version of the Metropolis presentation or any other aspect of our SOA content on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theserverside.net\/news\/thread.tss?thread_id=26889\">TheServerSide.NET<\/a>.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>By now, everyone has seen the big news &#8211; VS2005 Beta 1, Express versions and the new VS2005 Dev Center.
