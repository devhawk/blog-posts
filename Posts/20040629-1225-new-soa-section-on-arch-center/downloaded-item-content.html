<p>By now, everyone has seen the big news &#8211; <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/welcome">VS2005 Beta 1</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/express/">Express versions</a> and the new <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005">VS2005 Dev Center</a>. I&#8217;m provisioning a new VPC to install it on. I&#8217;d love to move to VS2005 for all my dev work, but I&#8217;m writing a few apps that need to be working in a production environment long before we get to Beta 2, so I&#8217;m going to leave those on VS.NET 2003&#8230;at least for now. However, there are a few longer-term things that I&#8217;m working on that I&#8217;ve been wait to start coding on for VS2005 that can now get started.</p>
<p align="left">On the architecture side, we launched a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/soa">new SOA resource page</a>. As part of the launch, we are featuring an updated version of Pat&#8217;s Metropolis presentation and a new SOA whitepaper. The version of Metropolis that has been a part of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series/">Architecture Strategy Series</a> was one of the first times Pat had presented it. Like many presentations, Pat refined his delivery with each new time he delivered the talk. The new version provides a new section that describes SOA as well as a section drilling down on the guidance that the Metropolis model provides. Even if you&#8217;ve seen the previous version, you should check out the new version.</p>
<p align="left">We also published a new whitepaper on <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/d/2/5/d2513e64-0dcd-4ef6-89c4-c99ee117936f/serviceorientationwpa4.doc">Service Orientation and Its Role in Your Connected Systems Strategy</a>. It takes a Crawl/Walk/Run approach to describing the approach and technology for service orientation today, next year with SQL 2005 &amp; VS 2005, and further out with Longhorn and Indigo. It also covers such areas as Service-Oriented Analysis, Designing for Change and Extensibility, Service Management and Pattern of Service-Oriented Solutions.</p>
