<ul><li>My Virtual TechEd Session <a href="http://www.virtualteched.com/videos/JohnFlandersHarryPiersonsmall.asf">What is Project Rome?</a> got posted. It's only 8 minutes long, so as you might expect it's fairly high level. Thanks to <a href="http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon/default.aspx">Jon Flanders</a> for handling interview duty.  </li><li>QUT's <a href="http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/Ruby.NET/">Garden Point Ruby.NET</a> compiler is now the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rubydotnetcompiler/">Ruby.NET open source project</a>.  </li><li>The NHL is partnering with <a href="http://www.neulion.com/">NeuLion</a> to provide IPTV services for NHL team websites. They <a href="http://www.neulion.com/news/2007/050707.php">piloted</a> with the <a href="http://www.newyorkislanders.com/">Islanders</a> last season. Wouldn't it be cool to get <a href="http://capitals.nhl.com/">my favorite team's</a> IPTV channel on my <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/ces2007/microsoftintegratesiptvsoftwareplatform.htm">Xbox 360</a>?  </li><li><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="139" alt="Crosby Gets Checked in NHL08" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/devhawk_images/WindowsLiveWriter/db4b61b806d0_EC23/NHL08_crosbydown_1.jpg" width="184" align="right" border="0" />Speaking of Hockey, I like this new <a href="http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/14029/NHL-08-Reebok-Edge-Trailer/">NHL 08 trailer</a>. It's about <a href="http://www.rbkedgeuniform.com/">Reebok's new uniform system</a>, so it focuses on the teams with new uniforms, including the Caps. It does feature marquee players from rival teams like Sidney Crosby and Eric Staal (who is the cover athlete) heavily. But any video featuring Ovechkin's stick handling, Semin scoring and Crosby falling to the ice is OK in my book. </li><li>Speaking of Video Games, the <a href="http://www.dreambuildplay.com">XNA Dream-Build-Play contest</a> is over. You can <a href="http://www.ziggyware.com/news.php?readmore=369">see and download</a> some of the submitted games over on Ziggyware. Some of them look awesome. (via <a href="http://klucher.com/archive/2007/07/20/playing-some-great-xna-framework-games.aspx">Michael Klucher</a>) </li><li>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/07/18/Morning+Coffee+102.aspx">said on Wednesday</a> that it was a slow week. It may be, but I've also been less than motivated on pretty much all geek fronts this week. Not sure why. </li></ul>
