It&#8217;s about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rbkedgeuniform.com\/\">Reebok&#8217;s new uniform system<\/a>, so it focuses on the teams with new uniforms, including the Caps. It does feature marquee players from rival teams like Sidney Crosby and Eric Staal (who is the cover athlete) heavily. But any video featuring Ovechkin&#8217;s stick handling, Semin scoring and Crosby falling to the ice is OK in my book. <\/li>\n<li>Speaking of Video Games, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dreambuildplay.com\">XNA Dream-Build-Play contest<\/a> is over.
