-   My Virtual TechEd Session [What is Project
    Rome?](http://www.virtualteched.com/videos/JohnFlandersHarryPiersonsmall.asf)
    got posted. It’s only 8 minutes long, so as you might expect it’s
    fairly high level. Thanks to [Jon
    Flanders](http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon/default.aspx)
    for handling interview duty.
-   QUT’s [Garden Point Ruby.NET](http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/Ruby.NET/)
    compiler is now the [Ruby.NET open source
    project](http://code.google.com/p/rubydotnetcompiler/).
-   The NHL is partnering with [NeuLion](http://www.neulion.com/) to
    provide IPTV services for NHL team websites. They
    [piloted](http://www.neulion.com/news/2007/050707.php) with the
    [Islanders](http://www.newyorkislanders.com/) last season. Wouldn’t
    it be cool to get [my favorite team’s](http://capitals.nhl.com/)
    IPTV channel on my [Xbox
    360](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/ces2007/microsoftintegratesiptvsoftwareplatform.htm)?

    ::: 
    I like this new [NHL 08 trailer](http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/14029/NHL-08-Reebok-Edge-Trailer/).
    It’s about [Reebok’s new uniform
    system](http://www.rbkedgeuniform.com/), so it focuses on the teams
    with new uniforms, including the Caps. It does feature marquee
    players from rival teams like Sidney Crosby and Eric Staal (who is
    the cover athlete) heavily. But any video featuring Ovechkin’s stick
    handling, Semin scoring and Crosby falling to the ice is OK in my
    book.
-   Speaking of Video Games, the [XNA Dream-Build-Play
    contest](http://www.dreambuildplay.com) is over. You can [see and
    download](http://www.ziggyware.com/news.php?readmore=369) some of
    the submitted games over on Ziggyware. Some of them look awesome.

-   I [said on
    Wednesday](http://devhawk.net/2007/07/18/morning-coffee-102/)
    that it was a slow week. It may be, but I’ve also been less than
    motivated on pretty much all geek fronts this week. Not sure why.
