One of them, Michael Lane Thomas, just spun a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.gotdotnet.com\/mlthomas\/\">weblog<\/a> up @ GDN Blogs. Like me, Michael is an evangelist in the field, though he&#8217;s on the dev side while I&#8217;m on the architecture side. In other words, we don&#8217;t build the stuff, we have to convince our customers to use it. <\/p>\n<p>One other note: Michael is the &#8220;.NET Cowboy&#8221;. My teammate Paul (who should start his own blog along with everyone else on my team) has decided that everyone on the team needs a call sign. I guess he saw Top Gun one too many times. So now I work with Ogre, Guns, Jet, Groove Train and Voodoo among others. I have been dubbed &#8220;Wizard&#8221; in obvious reference to Harry Potter. I guess it could be worse &#8211; I could have been saddled with Peach Fuzz or Full Moon.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m back from the big MSFT conference.
