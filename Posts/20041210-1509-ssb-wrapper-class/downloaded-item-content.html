<p>Paul Murphy <a href="http://blogs.aspadvice.com/pmurphy/archive/2004/12/09/1978.aspx">pointed out</a> a SSB wrapper class that ships as part of the integrated storefront sample that ships with SQL 2005. It&#8217;s a bit tricky to install, so I refer you to Paul&#8217;s blog for instructions. (you have to install the sample installer) The wrapper class is in a file called ServiceBroker.cs and supports the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get Conversation Group</li>
<li>Begin a Dialog</li>
<li>Begin a Dialog (with related conversation)</li>
<li>Send a Message</li>
<li>Receive a Message</li>
<li>Receive all messages from a conversation group</li>
<li>End a Dialog</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what dialogs and conversation groups are, I&#8217;ll be blogging about them in the coming weeks.</p>
