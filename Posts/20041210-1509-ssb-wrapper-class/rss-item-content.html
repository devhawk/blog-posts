<p>Paul Murphy <a href="http://blogs.aspadvice.com/pmurphy/archive/2004/12/09/1978.aspx">pointed out</a> a SSB wrapper class that ships as part of the integrated storefront sample that ships with SQL 2005. It's a bit tricky to install, so I refer you to Paul's blog for instructions. (you have to install the sample installer) The wrapper class is in a file called ServiceBroker.cs and supports the following operations:</p><ul><li>Get Conversation Group</li><li>Begin a Dialog</li><li>Begin a Dialog (with related conversation)</li><li>Send a Message</li><li>Receive a Message</li><li>Receive all messages from a conversation group</li><li>End a Dialog</li></ul><p>If you're not sure what dialogs and conversation groups are, I'll be blogging about them in the coming weeks.</p>
