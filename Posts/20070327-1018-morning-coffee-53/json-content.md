-   The Virtual PC 2007 virtual video card seems to max out @ 1600 x
    1200 resolution. Given that the two screens on my main dev
    workstation are 1200×1600 (i.e. portait mode) and 1680×1050, it
    means I can’t run VPC in full screen on my dev box. I can get close
    on the widescreen monitor, but I like writing code on the portain
    monitor better. Luckily, I can use remote desktop instead the built
    in VPC display window in order to get full screen on either monitor.

    [announces](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/03/26/visual-studio-turns-10.aspx)
    the aquisition and immediate (i.e. free) availability of Teamplain
    web client for VSTS as part of Visual Studio’s 10th birthday. We’re
    also “publishing the Orcas Wave (Orcas + Rosario) [roadmap for
    VSTS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/teamsystem/bb407307.aspx).” I’ll be
    interested to see the reaction to that. Mike’s reacti[on to the
    schedule](http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1107.aspx) was:
    “That’s insane”.
-   THe XNA tools just keep coming. Allegorithmic’s MaPZone texture
    creation tool [is free to XNA
    developers](http://www.mapzoneeditor.com/?PAGE=COMMUNITY.XNA).
    Actually, it looks like it’s [free for
    everyone](http://www.mapzoneeditor.com/), as a carrot to upgrade to
    their procedural texture tool
    [ProFX](http://www.mapzoneeditor.com/?PAGE=PROFX). Still, free tools
    are still free. (via [Michael

-   Can I get 1200U of rackspace, to go? [Apparently,
    yes](http://www.rackable.com/solutions/concentro.htm). (via [Half My

-   Watched the season finale of Battlestar Galactica last night. Wow,
    is there a better show on TV right now? (yes, one: Lost. But that’s
    it) When it ended, my wife said “We have to wait until 2008 for a
    new episode? That sucks”. I couldn’t agree more.
