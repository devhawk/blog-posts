<p>According to the Windows Server 2003 site, the Beta 2 Technical Refresh of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/sharepoint/default.mspx"> Windows Sharepoint Services</a> is now available (though the link still takes you to the beta 2 download page). I got access to this build earlier in the week, and I&#8217;ll be posting a v0.4.1 update to WSS RSS that supports WSS B2TR. Cool thing is that B2TR changed some stuff to make rendering link URLs easier, so the issue w/ the doc libraries getting the wrong URL in RSS is fixed.</p>
