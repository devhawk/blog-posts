It’s not the biggest [job change
news](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13282299) this week (or the
[day](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx)),
but after three years on Architecture Strategy and six years total as an
evangelist, I’m moving on to a new role. After six years, I decided it
was time for me to put my money where my mouth is as well as get my
hands dirty building something more substantial than buzz.

I’ll be moving over into Microsoft’s IT division as a member of the
Integration Center of Excellence Architecture Team. Integration, as you
might guess, is a euphemism here for service-orientation. My team is
tasked with architecting and delivering the shared service-oriented
infrastructure for four of the biggest projects Microsoft IT will be
delivering in the next year. [Last time I changed
jobs](http://devhawk.net/2003/09/19/Today+Is+The+Last+Day+Of+My+Life+So+Far.aspx),
I lamented that “With each job I take at MSFT, coding seems to become
less a part of the job description.” Happily, this is *NOT* the case
this time.

About a year ago, Microsoft hired [Stuart
Scott](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/stuartsc/default.mspx) to
run the business apps side of IT as one of our two CIOs (our other CIO
[Ron
Markezich](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/ronma/default.mspx)
oversees the IT infrastructure). Stuart was kind enough to spend about
an hour with me last week explaining his vision for how he sees MSIT
evolving under his leadership. Here’s what he said in a [recent
interview](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2005/dec05/12-05Scott.mspx):

> **PressPass: How do you see Microsoft IT evolving?**
>
> **Scott:** There is a broader role for IT to play at the front end of
> the development of products and services. Our IT organization knows a
> lot about the challenges that other IT organizations face because we
> build and maintain the IT backbone of a massive worldwide enterprise.
> IT must become future-thought leaders in the development of the
> product roadmap for our enterprise products.
>
> By using our internal applications and experiences to build better
> products for our enterprise customers, we have the potential to solve
> the challenges that other IT organizations face. We’re heavily
> involved in dogfooding our products once they’ve been developed, but
> we also see a role closer to the front end of the product development
> cycle. Business Intelligence is one area where we will be partnering
> with the product groups and Finance as we build out our internal
> capability. I want to ensure that any product we develop to meet the
> needs of Microsoft, also meets the needs of the marketplace.

He was also very frank about the current state of affairs in MSIT
relative to the vision. He was quoted in China Information World (no
link, sorry) as saying that “The systems Microsoft now uses are already
14 years old and based on previous versions of windows, so from a
systems capability perspective, they cannot support the needs of the
growing business.”

All in all, I was pretty impressed with what he’s setting out to do and
the opportunity not only from a business perspective from from an
industry perspective as well. Hence the whole “going to work in his
division” thing. Of course, “Thought Leadership” is one of the things
Architecture Strategy works on very diligently, so in some ways this
isn’t as big a change as it might be. On the other hand, giving advice
to people solving hard problems is a lot different than solving those
hard problems yourself.

I’ll be starting this new role pretty much immediately, so expect the
less-than-usual blogging to continue for the time being. But my external
visibility on my blog and presenting at conferences and executive
briefings is one of the things they hired me for. So after I get my
bearings things should be back to normal. At that point, I’ll hopefully
be able to talk in more specific terms about what we’re tackling on my
new team. I hope to shake things up quite a bit over there and deliver
the play by play here on my blog.

Massive thanks to [John deVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/) and
the rest of the Architecture Strategy Team. Back when I started, I think
[Simon Guest](http://blogs.msdn.com/smguest/) was the only other blogger
on the team. Now there are only three non-bloggers on the whole team.
It’s been a great three years and I’ve been a part of so many great
accomplishments:

-   Making Microsoft the first (I think!) global sponsor for the
    [International Association of Software
    Architects](http://www.iasahome.org/)
-   Delivering the [CRM Integration for Outlook Sample
    Application](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/OtlkLOBCRM.asp)
-   Launching the [Solution
    Architect](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/communities/mvp.aspx?product=1&competency=Visual+Developer+-+Solutions+Architect)
    and [Infrastructure
    Architect](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/communities/mvp.aspx?product=1&competency=Windows+Server+System+-+Infrastructure+Architect)
    MVP programs
-   Delivering the first-ever Architecture Track at Tech-Ed 2004
-   Taking [Arvindra’s](http://www.thearchitectexchange.com/asehmi/)
    amazing <span
    style="TEXT-DECORATION: line-through">JOURNAL</span>[The
    Architecture Journal](http://www.architecturejournal.net/) worldwide
-   Launching the [Architecture Resource
    Center](http://www.microsoft.com/architecture) and the [MSDN
    Solution Architecture
    Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/) websites
-   Presenting at PDC, worldwide Tech-Eds, p&p Summits and a host of
    other events
-   Meeting tons of customers in user group meetings, at executive
    briefings and in architecture design sessions

I always joke that if I ever left Microsoft, I wouldn’t want to go work
for another technical company. Now, I get the chance to go affect the
business of a Fortune 50 business while not having to leave Microsoft.
Pretty sweet.

See you on the other side.
