  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Anon:
Again and again I see the left trying to compare homosexuality to the plight of blacks over the years. A black man can't hide the fact that he is black. Since when does a homosexual get labeled a homosexual just by looking at them? For anyone to even compare the two has no argument at all, there is no comparisen. Until the day that a gay person has to wear some badge designating them as so, don't compare blacks and gays.

If we were to follow your blacks and gays, and about churches not being required to marry gays. What do you think would happen to a church that refused to hire an individual or marry a person if they were black?]]></wp:comment_content>
