<p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/02/25.html#a6667">Scoble</a> and <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1154">Chris</a> have blogged their support for homosexual marriage, so here&#8217;s my +1. Unlike Chris, I&#8217;ve known quite a few homosexuals in my life. Several of my best friends (as in, would seriously consider donating a kidney to kind of friends) are gay. I grew up hanging around the theater world where homosexuality is much more pervasive (and accepted) than &#8220;mainstream&#8221; society. I used to have a bunch of friends on a gay hockey team (it sounds clich&#233;, but they were called the Gay Blades). And this past summer, my wife, our then-six-month-old son and I went to Victoria, Canada to see my two uncles get married after a lifetime of commitment to each other.</p>
<p>As part of the ceremony, my uncle told me how much my involvement in his life has meant to him and husband. I wasn&#8217;t told that he was gay until I was going to college at USC, which was about an hour drive from my uncle&#8217;s home. For reasons they would have to explain, my parents didn&#8217;t tell me until then. When my mother finally told me my uncle was gay, she was in tears, so I naturally assumed he had AIDS and was dying. I mean, why else would she be crying? He wasn&#8217;t dying, she was just worried how I would react. As far as I was and still am concerned, being gay doesn&#8217;t change anything. Since I couldn&#8217;t fly back to the east coast for long weekends, I got to spend them with my uncles instead. I don&#8217;t get to see them as often as I did back then, though they have come up to see us twice since my son was born. But they will always be a major part of my life and I will be forever honored that they asked me and my family to be a part of their wedding.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge <a href="http://www.billmaher.com/">Bill Maher</a> fan and I only just recently discovered <a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/">Real Time</a>. He talked about gay marriage in the <a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/new_rules/20040213.html">Valentine&#8217;s Day edition of his New Rules</a>. As a Democrat, it really struck a cord with me.</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans used to be the party that opposed social engineering. But now they push programs to outlaw marriage for some people and encourage it for others. If you&#8217;re straight, there&#8217;s a billion-five in the budget to promote marriage, but gay marriage is opposed because it threatens or mocks or does something to the &#8220;sanctity&#8221; of marriage, as if anything you can do in Vegas, drunk off your ass in front of an Elvis impersonator, could be considered sacred. </p>
<p>But at least the right wing aren&#8217;t hypocrites on this issue. They really believe that homosexuality is an abomination and a dysfunction that&#8217;s curable&#8230;But I have to tell you, the greater shame in this story goes to the Democrats, because they don&#8217;t believe homosexuality is an abomination. And therefore, their refusal to endorse gay marriage is hypocrisy. Their position doesn&#8217;t come from the Bible. It&#8217;s ripped right from the latest poll, which says most Americans are against gay marriage. </p>
<p>Well, you know what? Sometimes most Americans are just wrong. And where is the Democrat who will stand up and go beyond the half measures of &#8220;civil union&#8221; and &#8220;hate the sin, love the sinner&#8221; and say loud and clear, &#8220;There is no sin; it&#8217;s not an abomination and no one can control how cupid aims his arrows.&#8221; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not running for office, but I&#8217;ll say it: Homosexuality isn&#8217;t a sin, an abomination or wrong. Letting homosexuals get married isn&#8217;t going to weaken society, change the most fundamental institution of civilization, cause the sky to fall or any of the other things that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/24/elec04.prez.bush.transcript/index.html">Bush claims</a> it will cause. Legislating discrimination however, which is what Bush&#8217;s proposed amendment to the Constitution amounts to, actually will weaken society and change what is really the most fundamental institution of civilization: freedom. </p>
<p>Bush certainly talks a lot about freedom when he&#8217;s trying to justify the <strike>invasion</strike> liberation of Iraq. However, in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/24/elec04.prez.bush.transcript/index.html">calling for a amendment to outlaw gay marriage</a>, the only reference to freedom was when he said that &#8220;commitment of freedom&#8230;does not require the redefinition of one of our most basic social institutions.&#8221; Actually, when these &#8220;basic social institutions&#8221; are inherently discriminatory &#8211; take slavery and women&#8217;s lack of right to vote as examples &#8211; it is absolutely required that we redefine them to eliminate the discrimination. Otherwise, we become the kind of a <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568245/Fascism.html">fascist society</a> that our founding fathers were trying to avoid when they wrote the <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569008_3/Constitution_of_the_United_States.html#s69">Constitution</a> in the first place. That&#8217;s what establishing Justice, insuring domestic Tranquility and securing the Blessings of Liberty is all about.</p>
