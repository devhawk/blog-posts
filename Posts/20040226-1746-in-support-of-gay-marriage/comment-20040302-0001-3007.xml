I must assume that you don't know many gay people.  Or that, if you do, you haven't been around when they are yelled at.  I am not a homosexual but I have had many people label me as one just by looking at me.

Don't make the mistake of thinking that I am comparing blacks to gays.  I am comparing the close-minded ignorance of certain ranks of our society in various points thoughout our history.]]></wp:comment_content>
