  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA["are churches then required to perform the ceremony? No, then why are churches even needed anymore to perform a marriage."

Churches are not currently required to perform marriage ceremonies.  That will not change if/when having 2 grooms is legal.  



"How can morality say one thing is ok and another wrong. "

That is *all* morality does.




As for the fall of our society, my direct ancestors fought each other in the American Revolutionary War and in the American Civil War.  They also fought against the fall of "their society" during the civil rights movement.  I have relatives that never got over the fact that blacks could now go to the same schools as white people.  Even drink from the same water fountain!

Sometimes things need to change, fall, be replaced.]]></wp:comment_content>
