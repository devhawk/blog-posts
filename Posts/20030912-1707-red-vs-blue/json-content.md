I was mucking around with [Markâ€™s](http://diveintomark.org) [RESTful
interface](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/09/08/msweb-rest) to
the [Microsoft.com web
service](http://ws.microsoft.com/MsComService/MsCom.asmx) when I noticed
the most recent available download was the [Red vs. Blue PDC
Video](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8182C2EF-B8DA-4DAE-8841-6A059B2F68B0&displaylang=en).
Well worth the download!
