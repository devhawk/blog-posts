<p>So it was <a href="http://devhawk.net/default.aspx?date=2003-01-14">a year ago today</a> that I started this blog. It's interesting to see how much has changed in that time. <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=16e48c40-21ed-480f-a51f-70f88755901f">My son was born</a>, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e16c7694-ead9-40da-a9ca-18af6359680c">switched jobs</a>, I got an article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/03/siteskinning/default.aspx">published in MSDN</a> and even <a href="http://techiewife.com/">my wife is blogging</a> now. And I'm even blogging this from Phoenix where I started blogging in the first place! </p><p>I was in Phoenix for a local architect roundtable event. It went great. I was filling in for a teammate who had a conflict, but I hope to do more of these in the future as it's a chance to interact directly with the architect community. I presented Metropolis - we're working on getting more info about that up on architecture center very soon. I also got a chance to do my "performance doesn't matter" <strike>rant</strike> discussion that seems to always come up when you start talking about building services. I'll blog that later, I've got a plane to catch.</p>
