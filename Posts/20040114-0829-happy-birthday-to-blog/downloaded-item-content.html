<p>So it was <a href="http://devhawk.net/default.aspx?date=2003-01-14">a year ago today</a> that I started this blog. It&#8217;s interesting to see how much has changed in that time. <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=16e48c40-21ed-480f-a51f-70f88755901f">My son was born</a>, I <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e16c7694-ead9-40da-a9ca-18af6359680c">switched jobs</a>, I got an article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/03/siteskinning/default.aspx">published in MSDN</a> and even <a href="http://techiewife.com/">my wife is blogging</a> now. And I&#8217;m even blogging this from Phoenix where I started blogging in the first place! </p>
<p>I was in Phoenix for a local architect roundtable event. It went great. I was filling in for a teammate who had a conflict, but I hope to do more of these in the future as it&#8217;s a chance to interact directly with the architect community. I presented Metropolis &#8211; we&#8217;re working on getting more info about that up on architecture center very soon. I also got a chance to do my &#8220;performance doesn&#8217;t matter&#8221; <strike>rant</strike> discussion that seems to always come up when you start talking about building services. I&#8217;ll blog that later, I&#8217;ve got a plane to catch.</p>
