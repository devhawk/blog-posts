It doesn\u2019t make me Nostradamus, but I did guess we were going to have \u201ca very ugly race, especially from the Republicans\u201d and that \u201cthe nomination race will be worse\u201d than the general election.

This election is far from being in the bag for Obama, but the suggestion that McCain will come from six or seven points down in the polls to win a 10-20 point bigger EV victory than Bush did four years ago seems like crazy talk. As for me, I\u2019m not willing to make a firm prediction except to say that I think the polls are wrong \u2013 I\u2019m just not sure in what direction they\u2019re wrong. <\/p>\n<p>On the one hand, if the polls are underestimating Obama\u2019s support by excluding cell-phone only voters and Obama\u2019s Get Out The Vote effort is as strong as it looks, that could net Obama as much as five or six points on top of the lead he\u2019s already got and we\u2019ll be looking at an epic landslide with Obama maybe brushing up against 400 EV. For example, Pollster.com\u2019s 291 solid\/lean Obama EV + 105 toss up EVs would be 396 total EVs for Obama.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the polls are overestimating Obama\u2019s support due to the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bradley_effect\">Bradley Effect<\/a>, the undecideds break for decisively for McCain and Obama\u2019s GOTV effort doesn\u2019t materialize, McCain\u2019s might net those five or six points and turn this into a toss-up squeaker decided by less than 35 EV (about the size of Bush\u2019s victory in 2004). For example, if McCain wins all of Pollster.com\u2019s tossups + the lean Obama states, it\u2019s a scant 8 EV Obama victory (273-265). If McCain could also pick off any of New Mexico, Colorado, Iowa or Pennsylvania in that scenario, then he would win by anywhere from 2-34 EVs. <\/p>\n<p>Of course, those effects could cancel out and leave us where we are right now, Obama with a six to seven point PV and low 100s EV victory. Frankly, I\u2019ll be happy to be wrong about the poll inaccuracy since that would give Obama the presidency. <\/p>\n<p>How do you think things are going to play out today?<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>(Editor\u2019s note: almost every time I make a political post, some yahoo, typically anonymously, suggests that I \u201cstick to technology\u201d.
