<p>Just got a call from my parents &#8211; my father&#8217;s copy of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/03/default.aspx">MSDN Magazine</a> with my article just arrived today. (Yes it&#8217;s true, I followed in the &#8220;family business&#8221; of software development). Mine hasn&#8217;t shown up yet nor is it published online yet, but it&#8217;s very cool to know it&#8217;s on it&#8217;s way.</p>
