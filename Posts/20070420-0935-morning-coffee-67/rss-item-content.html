<ul><li>Beta 1 of VS "Orcas" and .NET Framework 3.5 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/04/19/visual-studio-orcas-and-net-fx-3-5-beta1-shipped.aspx">has shipped</a>. Get it <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx">here</a>. Besides LINQ, I'm most looking forward to experimenting with some of the new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/moustafa/archive/2007/03/04/visual-studio-orcasand-wf-wcf-rules-changes.aspx">WF/WCF integration work</a>. However, I don't think this beta includes <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718807.aspx">DBPro functionality</a>. Not surprising, given that DBPro only shipped a few months ago, but disappointing since I've moved all my database dev work over to that model.

</li><li>After <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18227600/">his performance</a> in front the Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Gonzales is grossly incompetent, lying or both. What does it say about President Bush that he was "<a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/013745.php">pleased with the Attorney Generalâ€™s testimony</a>"? It says Bush values loyalty over competence, is hiding something or both. Given that his approval ratings can't get much worse, I guess standing by Gonzales even in the midst of bi-partisan calls for his resignation isn't going to affect Bush much politically. On the other hand, confirming a new AG with a Democratic congress and low 30% approval rating might be devastating, depending on the bodies buried over there.</li></ul>
