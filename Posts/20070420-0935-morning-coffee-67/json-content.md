-   Beta 1 of VS “Orcas” and .NET Framework 3.5 [has
    shipped](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/04/19/visual-studio-orcas-and-net-fx-3-5-beta1-shipped.aspx).
    Get it
    [here](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx).
    Besides LINQ, I’m most looking forward to experimenting with some of
    the new [WF/WCF integration
    work](http://blogs.msdn.com/moustafa/archive/2007/03/04/visual-studio-orcasand-wf-wcf-rules-changes.aspx).
    However, I don’t think this beta includes [DBPro
    functionality](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718807.aspx).
    Not surprising, given that DBPro only shipped a few months ago, but
    disappointing since I’ve moved all my database dev work over to that
    model.

    – but this seems like something fundamentally new – or at least new
    to me – and therefore interesting. (via

    the [new version of
    Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) to re-enable
    Ruby support [originally
    built](http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2005/07/notepad2_with_r.html)
    by Wesner Moise. Ruby is nice, but where’s the
    [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/PowerShell) love?
-   After [his performance](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18227600/) in
    front the Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Gonzales is grossly
    incompetent, lying or both. What does it say about President Bush
    that he was “[pleased with the Attorney General’s
    testimony](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/013745.php)“?
    It says Bush values loyalty over competence, is hiding something or
    both. Given that his approval ratings can’t get much worse, I guess
    standing by Gonzales even in the midst of bi-partisan calls for his
    resignation isn’t going to affect Bush much politically. On the
    other hand, confirming a new AG with a Democratic congress and low
    30% approval rating might be devastating, depending on the bodies
    buried over there.
