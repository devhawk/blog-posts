In response, I told him a secret. He&#8217;s got access to many more secrets than I do, so I figure he&#8217;s good at keeping them.<\/p>\n<p>On secrets &#8211; I know there are a few times I have gone to write something on this blog just to delete it in the interest of keeping a secret. And not just MSFT secrets. I wrote a whole entry on a potential project that I don&#8217;t really have time to write. But in the end, I decided to keep it a secret in case I was ever able to build it. Not that it would make a huge amount of money &#8211; in MSFT terms it would be a component of a larger product. It&#8217;s just something I thought would be cool. (And this isn&#8217;t even the secret I told Scoble!). As Scoble points out, as an evangelist part of our job is to keep secrets. And to dole them out to what he calls the &#8220;influentials&#8221;. He&#8217;s talking about journalists, but for me, influentials are decision makers at my customers. Love or hate MSFT, everyone wants to know about what&#8217;s coming down the pipe. While I have lots of interesting things to say to customers, none more so than what follows: &#8220;You guys are under NDA, right?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s something that isn&#8217;t a secret: Scoble must get by on about 4 hours of sleep every night. He blogged 30 more times last night! That&#8217;s a total of 33 times in the 4 hours between 10pm and 2am. Wow. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I chatted w\/ Scoble last night around 10:30pm.
