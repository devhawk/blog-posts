The theme that my wife wanted for <a href=\"http:\/\/techiewife.com\/\">her weblog<\/a> comes with a variety of different sayings for the top of the page (My Journal, Welcome, Listen To My Cheery Chirpings, etc). I thought it would be cool if the image rotated or changed every time you came to the site. So I built my own custom macro class that overrides the radio.macros.imageUrl macro. Now, if you pass in a series of images seperated by vertical pipes (i.e. &#8220;image1.gif|image2.gif|image3.gif&#8221;), it will split out into an array of image urls and pick one at random.
