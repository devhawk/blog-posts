<p>I'm back from vacation and I just <em>had</em> to deploy a small dasBlog update that I hacked up while I was on the plane and my wife and son were sleeping. <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/">Clemens</a><a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/MessageBoard/Thread.aspx?id=170388">posted</a> on the GDN workspace about registering your own macro classes. The theme that my wife wanted for <a href="http://techiewife.com/">her weblog</a> comes with a variety of different sayings for the top of the page (My Journal, Welcome, Listen To My Cheery Chirpings, etc). I thought it would be cool if the image rotated or changed every time you came to the site. So I built my own custom macro class that overrides the radio.macros.imageUrl macro. Now, if you pass in a series of images seperated by vertical pipes (i.e. "image1.gif|image2.gif|image3.gif"), it will split out into an array of image urls and pick one at random. Pretty cool. Anyone want to see the code?</p>
