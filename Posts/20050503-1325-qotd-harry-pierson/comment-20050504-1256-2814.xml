  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[HHHuuummm......

This sounds a paraphrasing of my favorite "workplace vindictive":

"Cluelessness":  There are no stupid questions.  But there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.

liberlly stolen from my favorite "workplace attitude adjustment" website:  www.despair.com  (specifically the "workplace motivator" poster at http://www.despair.com/cluelessness.html)

(My second favorite?  Dilbert's website of course!)

I buy the Despair calender each year for my zoo cell...er, cubicle, and I've got a stack of "cluelessness" sticky-notes on my desk ready to write prescriptions for anyone with this affliction...  (Usually, it's a URL, like where to go to get "some stuff" on that Windows operatin' system, msdn.microsoft.com.  DDDUUUUHHHHHH.........)

The hilarious thing about despair.com is that I actually know more than one guy who's lost their job here in Sillycon Valley due to plastering their cubicles with these $15 posters...only to find out how severly humor-impaired some bigwig was...

I just tell them, "You don't REALLY want to work for those kind of jerks, now DO YOU?!?!"

Oh, your QOTD would CERTAINLY qualify as a good example of a "disrespectful" workplace technique...according to the "Respect in the Workplace" mandatory class I had to attend this week.  The mere act of "mocking" someone would get you some demerits or a paddlin' out back...

Keep up the good work!  (And visit Despair.com for more ammo to use against the clueless and other branches of the Homo Stupidien tree of life...)
