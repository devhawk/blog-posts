David is a research fellow for Phillips and is an expert on genetic algorithms. He was one of the founding members of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.isgec.org\/\">International Society for Genetic and Evolutionary Computation<\/a> and an editor for <a href=\"http:\/\/mitpress.mit.edu\/journal-home.tcl?issn=10636560\">Evolutionary Computation Journal<\/a>. He was in town for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.isgec.org\/gecco-2004\">Genetic and Evolutionary Computation COnference 2004<\/a> (i.e. GECCO &#8211; cute). It was funny that we are both software experts (though he is much more expert than I), but had to explain to the other what we did. I explained SOA to him and he explained genetic algorithms to me. We didn&#8217;t into too much depth over dinner &#8211; it was much more fun to watch Patrick try and feed himself noodles and talk about family stuff. However, I think I want to learn more about this &#8211; I&#8217;m thinking there will be applicability of genetic and evolutionary computation to SOA. Maybe I can get David to write for my <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/journal\">JOURNAL<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>David is also into genealogy, and he gave me a copy of the family tree he&#8217;s been building up over the years. It&#8217;s all 20 year old console apps and text files, but he wants to bring it to the web in order to better enable collaboration among family members. Of course, David&#8217;s never built a web app before. Sounds like a job for <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/express\/vwd\">Visual Web Developer 2005 Express<\/a>! (BTW, what&#8217;s the abbreviation for that? VWD?)<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Julie, Patrick and I had dinner with my cousin David Schaffer tonight.
