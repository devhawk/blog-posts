<p>I did say I was going to go a little dark when I took the new job didn&#8217;t I? Things have been hectic &#8211; my brother&#8217;s getting married in just under two weeks and I&#8217;m working on getting my part of my new project&#8217;s Business Requirements Document (otherwise known as the BRD) done before I leave on vacation. The BRD process is fairly odd for this project &#8211; for one, the project team is writing it instead of the business unit. Given that we&#8217;re building infrastructure, many of the &#8220;business&#8221; elements of the BRD are not particularly appropriate. But we&#8217;re muddling thru. In a meeting with my boss&#8217;s boss&#8217;s boss last week, he stressed the need for delivering incremental value. In other words, the need for using an agile process which is cool as far as I&#8217;m concerned.</p>
<p>I have a couple of longer posts coming, but here are a few short takes for a Monday morning:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com"><strong>Windows Live Writer</strong></a></p>
<p>Everyone seems gaga over the new tool, so I downloaded it. Pretty cool. I&#8217;m writing this post using it. Typically, I write my posts in <strike>FrontPage</strike><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/programs/designer/highlights.mspx">SharePoint Designer</a> and paste them into the dasBlog web editing interface &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty particular about the HTML that ends up on my blog. So far, Writer seems up for the job. And I love the Web Layout editing mode. Does have some bugs and missing features. For example, it has spell check, but not background spell check.&nbsp;And as <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WindowsLiveWriterAndDasBlog19.aspx">Scott pointed out</a> the category list is totally broken when you have a lot of categories. Writer has an <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Windows%20Live%20Writer%20SDK%20(Beta).msi">SDK</a>, and one of the examples they suggest building with it is &#8220;Tags from tagging services&#8221;. I&#8217;d like to have a simple text box where I could enter categories as tags, and have it automatically create any categories that aren&#8217;t already on my site. I&#8217;ve already got a side coding project going, but I&#8217;m almost done so maybe I&#8217;ll take that up next.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/xna/gamestudio"><strong>XNA Game Studio</strong></a></p>
<p>I was researching some Xbox stuff for a customer several months ago and got wind of this plan. I can&#8217;t wait to see it running. I recently picked up <a href="http://www.moon-labs.com/">Frank Luna&#8217;s</a><a href="http://www.moon-labs.com/ml_book2.htm">Intro to 3d Game Programming: A Shader Approach</a>&nbsp;based on <a href="http://letskilldave.com/archive/2006/07/18/Review_3A00_-Introduction-to-3D-Game-Programming-with-Direct-X-9.0c_3A00_-A-Shader-Approach-.aspx">Dave&#8217;s recommendation</a>. I figure most, if not all, the source code will be obsolete in the XNA Framework world, but the concepts are spot on so it&#8217;s been a good read. </p>
<p>One aspect of this announcement that I haven&#8217;t seen talked about yet is the impact on the mod community. Many games today ship with an SDK &#8211; here are examples for <a href="http://garage.gaspowered.com">Dungeon Siege</a>, <a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Main_Page">Half-Life 2</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/">Doom 3</a>.&nbsp;Of course, the idea is that modder&#8217;s get a popular game and industrial-strength game engine to build on for almost no cost and the game publisher expands the value of their game &#8211; any mods require the original game to play. Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if you could mod <a href="http://www.xbox.com/halo3/">Halo 3</a>? And combined with <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1960510,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532">Live Anywhere</a>, the possibilities are enormous. I can&#8217;t wait to see how this evolves.</p>
<p><strong>New Machine &amp; Vista</strong></p>
<p>For the first time in my nearly 8 year MSFT career, I have a desktop machine. And it&#8217;s a nice one &#8211; a <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/precn_690">Dell Precision 690 workstation</a>. 2x dual Xenon CPU, 2x 160GB SCSI Hard Drives, <a href="http://www.ati.com/products/workstation/FireGL-Dual_Link.pdf">dual link DVI outputs</a> for driving twin widescreen monitors &#8211; dual is very big on this machine. Pretty much the only skimpy part of this machine is the RAM &#8211; only 2GB. But I&#8217;m not running x64 (yet) so that&#8217;s not a huge deal (yet). </p>
<p>Of course, such a screaming machine runs the latest <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_5472_gallery_01.asp">Vista build</a>.&nbsp;I&#8217;m also running it on my laptop &#8211; with Aero&nbsp;Glass even, thanks to <a href="http://www.laptopvideo2go.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=10420">this driver</a>.&nbsp;The combo of latest Vista build + latest Office build is pretty sweet.</p>
<p>With new machines and new operating systems, I&#8217;ve been spending significant time installing. The Dell box turned out to be a real pain as it <em>only </em>has the SCSI drives which are not standard on the WinXP install disk. I&#8217;m dual booting XP/Vista on both machines, but I had to create a <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/2005/01/how_to_slipstre.html">custom slipstreamed XP install disk</a> to get my Dell workstation up and running (Vista installed without any extra work). But now I&#8217;ve got the baseline install imaged &#8211; thanks to <a href="http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/bootitng.html">BootIt NG</a> which I&#8217;ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2005/09/20/New+Dev+Partition+Contents.aspx">spoken highly</a> of before &#8211; I shouldn&#8217;t ever have to do that again.</p>
