I just noticed that the inaugural Microsoft Architecture Update newsletter is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/update/">posted online</a>. We handed out hardcopies @ the PDC. There's a little piece in there on our community efforts by yours truly. Thankfully, my horrific picture didn't make it into the online version. I'm actually going to have an "official" (read: good) picture of me taken for future use at some point.
