<p>I just noticed that the inaugural Microsoft Architecture Update newsletter is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/update/">posted online</a>. We handed out hardcopies @ the PDC. There&#8217;s a little piece in there on our community efforts by yours truly. Thankfully, my horrific picture didn&#8217;t make it into the online version. I&#8217;m actually going to have an &#8220;official&#8221; (read: good) picture of me taken for future use at some point.</p>
