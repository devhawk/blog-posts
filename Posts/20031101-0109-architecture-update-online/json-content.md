I just noticed that the inaugural Microsoft Architecture Update
newsletter is [posted
online](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/update/). We handed out
hardcopies @ the PDC. There’s a little piece in there on our community
efforts by yours truly. Thankfully, my horrific picture didn’t make it
into the online version. I’m actually going to have an “official” (read:
good) picture of me taken for future use at some point.
