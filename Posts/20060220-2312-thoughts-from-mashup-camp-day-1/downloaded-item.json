I\u2019m going to post a couple of quick thoughts and then hit the sack. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It was great to see <a href=\"http:\/\/c2.com\/cgi\/wiki?WardCunningham\">Ward<\/a>. When he got up to suggest a session topic he got a round of applause.\n<\/li>\n<li>I went to the morning session on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mashupcamp.com\/index.cgi?BusinessModelsInMashups\">Business Models for Mashups<\/a>. Most interesting to me was the number of mashup developers not looking for funding. Either they don\u2019t care much (it\u2019s a hobby) or they think they can succeed w\/o the extra cash. Otherwise, the session was lots of questions and not many answers.\n<\/li>\n<li>I spent lunch hanging out with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yoz.com\/\">Yoz<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ning.com\/\">Ning<\/a>. Ning is fascinating. Not sure I understand the business model (I think it\u2019s ad-funded, but there aren\u2019t many ads) but it\u2019s definitely something I need to look into further.\n<\/li>\n<li>Session after lunch was on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoftgadgets.com\/\">gadgets<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/widgets.yahoo.com\/\">widgets<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/apis\/homepage\/\">modules<\/a>. Interesting to see the major differences in each of the approaches. <a href=\"http:\/\/spaces.msn.com\/siteexperts\">Scott Isaacs<\/a> made some interesting points about the lack of an application model in the browser. But several folks seemed to imply that a web based application hitting a local web server was a good approach to offline apps. Why wouldn\u2019t you just build a smart client app? The productivity of Windows Forms blows AJAX away (for now).\n<\/li>\n<li>I wanted to see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lessig.org\/\">Lawrence Lessig\u2019s<\/a> session on Creative Commons, but the room was too crowded. Similar problem to the Business Models for Mashups session, but even more so. I went and read email.\n<\/li>\n<li>Last session was about architecture patterns for AJAX applications, hosted by Scott Isaacs. It was more of a presentation than a discussion, but very interesting.\n<\/li>\n<li>Evening reception was sponsored by Yahoo! They had a cool ice sculpture and branded drinks \u2013 Yahootinis \u2013 with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.litecubes.com\/\">litecubes<\/a> in them. My son Patrick is going to love these.\n<\/li>\n<li>I got to meet <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ebizq.net\/blogs\/column2\/\">Sandy Kemsley<\/a>, who is friends with my friend <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blahgkarma.com\/wp\/\">Chris Church<\/a> who helped me get into Mashup Camp. I was instructed to buy Sandy a drink or three, but Yahoo! sprung for an open bar, so there was no buying. But we did have an interesting chat about workflow, business process and Office as a platform. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I don\u2019t sleep well on the road so I\u2019m exhausted.
