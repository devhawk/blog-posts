I don’t sleep well on the road so I’m exhausted. I’m going to post a
couple of quick thoughts and then hit the sack.

-   It was great to see [Ward](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham).
    When he got up to suggest a session topic he got a round of
    applause.
-   I went to the morning session on [Business Models for
    Mashups](http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?BusinessModelsInMashups).
    Most interesting to me was the number of mashup developers not
    looking for funding. Either they don’t care much (it’s a hobby) or
    they think they can succeed w/o the extra cash. Otherwise, the
    session was lots of questions and not many answers.
-   I spent lunch hanging out with [Yoz](http://www.yoz.com/) from
    [Ning](http://www.ning.com/). Ning is fascinating. Not sure I
    understand the business model (I think it’s ad-funded, but there
    aren’t many ads) but it’s definitely something I need to look into
    further.
-   Session after lunch was on
    [gadgets](http://www.microsoftgadgets.com/),
    [widgets](http://widgets.yahoo.com/) and
    [modules](http://www.google.com/apis/homepage/). Interesting to see
    the major differences in each of the approaches. [Scott
    Isaacs](http://spaces.msn.com/siteexperts) made some interesting
    points about the lack of an application model in the browser. But
    several folks seemed to imply that a web based application hitting a
    local web server was a good approach to offline apps. Why wouldn’t
    you just build a smart client app? The productivity of Windows Forms
    blows AJAX away (for now).
-   I wanted to see [Lawrence Lessig’s](http://www.lessig.org/) session
    on Creative Commons, but the room was too crowded. Similar problem
    to the Business Models for Mashups session, but even more so. I went
    and read email.
-   Last session was about architecture patterns for AJAX applications,
    hosted by Scott Isaacs. It was more of a presentation than a
    discussion, but very interesting.
-   Evening reception was sponsored by Yahoo! They had a cool ice
    sculpture and branded drinks – Yahootinis – with
    [litecubes](http://www.litecubes.com/) in them. My son Patrick is
    going to love these.
-   I got to meet [Sandy Kemsley](http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/column2/),
    who is friends with my friend [Chris
    Church](http://www.blahgkarma.com/wp/) who helped me get into Mashup
    Camp. I was instructed to buy Sandy a drink or three, but Yahoo!
    sprung for an open bar, so there was no buying. But we did have an
    interesting chat about workflow, business process and Office as a
    platform.
