<p>I don&#8217;t sleep well on the road so I&#8217;m exhausted. I&#8217;m going to post a couple of quick thoughts and then hit the sack. </p>
<ul>
<li>It was great to see <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward</a>. When he got up to suggest a session topic he got a round of applause.
</li>
<li>I went to the morning session on <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?BusinessModelsInMashups">Business Models for Mashups</a>. Most interesting to me was the number of mashup developers not looking for funding. Either they don&#8217;t care much (it&#8217;s a hobby) or they think they can succeed w/o the extra cash. Otherwise, the session was lots of questions and not many answers.
</li>
<li>I spent lunch hanging out with <a href="http://www.yoz.com/">Yoz</a> from <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>. Ning is fascinating. Not sure I understand the business model (I think it&#8217;s ad-funded, but there aren&#8217;t many ads) but it&#8217;s definitely something I need to look into further.
</li>
<li>Session after lunch was on <a href="http://www.microsoftgadgets.com/">gadgets</a>, <a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com/">widgets</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/homepage/">modules</a>. Interesting to see the major differences in each of the approaches. <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/siteexperts">Scott Isaacs</a> made some interesting points about the lack of an application model in the browser. But several folks seemed to imply that a web based application hitting a local web server was a good approach to offline apps. Why wouldn&#8217;t you just build a smart client app? The productivity of Windows Forms blows AJAX away (for now).
</li>
<li>I wanted to see <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig&#8217;s</a> session on Creative Commons, but the room was too crowded. Similar problem to the Business Models for Mashups session, but even more so. I went and read email.
</li>
<li>Last session was about architecture patterns for AJAX applications, hosted by Scott Isaacs. It was more of a presentation than a discussion, but very interesting.
</li>
<li>Evening reception was sponsored by Yahoo! They had a cool ice sculpture and branded drinks &#8211; Yahootinis &#8211; with <a href="http://www.litecubes.com/">litecubes</a> in them. My son Patrick is going to love these.
</li>
<li>I got to meet <a href="http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/column2/">Sandy Kemsley</a>, who is friends with my friend <a href="http://www.blahgkarma.com/wp/">Chris Church</a> who helped me get into Mashup Camp. I was instructed to buy Sandy a drink or three, but Yahoo! sprung for an open bar, so there was no buying. But we did have an interesting chat about workflow, business process and Office as a platform. </li>
</ul>
