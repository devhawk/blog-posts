<blockquote><p>Devhawk.net did a really smart thing with Feedster &#8212; he added it to has blog&#8217;s UI essentially as a &#8220;virtual table of contents&#8221;. Good idea. I think I need to offer some viewing improvements if people are going to do this. [<a href="http://www.feedster.com/blog/2003/03/19.html#a1513">The FuzzyBlog</a>]</p>

<p>Thanks for the complement. I&#8217;d love to see some viewing improvements (and a SOAP interface). The only issue I&#8217;ve seen is that my Feedster index hasn&#8217;t been updated since March 13th. Is this an issue with new hardware or has my weblog been added multiple times? Here&#8217;s another improvement suggestion &#8211; It would be nice to be able to search the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/showfeeds.php"> list of feeds</a>,</p>
