<blockquote><p>Devhawk.net did a really smart thing with Feedster -- he added it to has blog's UI essentially as a "virtual table of contents". Good idea. I think I need to offer some viewing improvements if people are going to do this.

The only issue I've seen is that my Feedster index hasn't been updated since March 13th. Is this an issue with new hardware or has my weblog been added multiple times? Here's another improvement suggestion - It would be nice to be able to search the <a href="http://www.feedster.com/showfeeds.php"> list of feeds</a>,</p>
