<p>While I was&nbsp;in the far east last week,&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/events/default.aspx">Architecture and Design Events</a> page of <a href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/architecture">Architecture Center</a> got updated. Thanks go to Lawrence, Richard and Mark &#8211; Architecture Center&#8217;s own three amigos if you will. Looks like the Software Factories guys are going to very busy, most of the upcoming events feature some type of presentation on factories, models or domain specific languages.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s cool about this list is that it features MS events like TechEd and PDC as well as non-MS events like OOPSLA, UML Conference and OOP. The only bad thing about this list is that I&#8217;d like it to be longer. Should there be more architecture-centric events or more architecture content at developer-centric events on this list?</p>
