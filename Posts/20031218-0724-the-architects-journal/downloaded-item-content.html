In addition to his <a href="http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article6.html">article on dasBlog</a>, issue 1 contains articles on <a href="http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article2.html">SOA</a>, <a href="http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article1.html">architecture design</a>, <a href="http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article3.html">business process</a>, <a href="http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article4.html">meta-data driven design</a> and <a href="http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article5.html">rule-based application development</a>. You can download&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/docs/MS%20EMEA%20Architects%20Journal%20-%20Issue1%20-%20A4.pdf">entire issue as a PDF</a>. Major props to <a href="http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/editorial.html">Arvindra Sehmi</a>, editor of the Architect&#8217;s Journal. When I first took this job, <a href="http://www.sabbasoft.com/">Enrico Sabbadin</a> suggested that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag">MSDN Magazine</a>&nbsp;should have a regular architecture focused article. I think we will all agree that Arvindra&#8217;s journal dedicated to the topic is an even better idea. </p>
<p>Going forward, my group will be working Arvindra&#8217;s group to help publish the journal. It&#8217;s interesting to note that none of the six articles in issue 1 are written by Microsoft architects. While I hope to see some articles written by Microsoft architects, the plan of action is to primarily feature architects from our partners, our customers and from the community. Anyone interested? </p>
