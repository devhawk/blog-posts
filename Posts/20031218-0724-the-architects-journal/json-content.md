the [Microsoft EMEA Architect’s
Journal](http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/) a couple weeks ago. In
addition to his [article on
dasBlog](http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article6.html),
issue 1 contains articles on
[SOA](http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article2.html),
[architecture
design](http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article1.html),
[business
process](http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article3.html),
[meta-data driven
design](http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article4.html)
and [rule-based application
development](http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/article5.html).
You can download the [entire issue as a
PDF](http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/docs/MS%20EMEA%20Architects%20Journal%20-%20Issue1%20-%20A4.pdf).
Major props to [Arvindra
Sehmi](http://www.thearchitectjournal.com/Journal/issue1/editorial.html),
editor of the Architect’s Journal. When I first took this job, [Enrico
Sabbadin](http://www.sabbasoft.com/) suggested that [MSDN
Magazine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag) should have a regular
architecture focused article. I think we will all agree that Arvindra’s
journal dedicated to the topic is an even better idea.

Going forward, my group will be working Arvindra’s group to help publish
the journal. It’s interesting to note that none of the six articles in
issue 1 are written by Microsoft architects. While I hope to see some
articles written by Microsoft architects, the plan of action is to
primarily feature architects from our partners, our customers and from
the community. Anyone interested?
