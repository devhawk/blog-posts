I think we will all agree that Arvindra&#8217;s journal dedicated to the topic is an even better idea. <\/p>\n<p>Going forward, my group will be working Arvindra&#8217;s group to help publish the journal. It&#8217;s interesting to note that none of the six articles in issue 1 are written by Microsoft architects. While I hope to see some articles written by Microsoft architects, the plan of action is to primarily feature architects from our partners, our customers and from the community. Anyone interested? <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Clemensblogged the Microsoft EMEA Architect&#8217;s Journal a couple weeks ago.
