<li>I got my Tecra M4 back sans flaky motherboard. That&#8217;s my full time laptop now &#8211; it&#8217;s nice to have a laptop that supports Vista. I&#8217;m still running XP on my desktop out of a combination of lack of video driver + laziness. I run dual monitor with my primary monitor rotated to be portrait instead of landscape. Easier to read websites and documents that way. Unfortunately, while there&#8217;s a generic WDDM driver for my video card&#8217;s chipset, it doesn&#8217;t support the rotate function. But according to the Dell support site, they released a new driver for my card a few weeks ago so maybe it&#8217;s time to try the upgrade again. </li>
<li>I sat down to watch <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/">Heroes</a> last night, forgetting that it&#8217;s not on again until April. Watched <a href="http://fox.com/24/">24</a> instead, but it has really <a href="http://www.jumptheshark.com">jumped the shark</a>. </li>
<li>Scott Guthrie continues his series on new Orcas language features, this time covering <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/03/13/new-orcas-language-feature-extension-methods.aspx">extension methods</a>. On the one hand, it&#8217;s pure syntactic sugar. On the other, how sweet it is. It&#8217;s kinda surprising that no other mainstream language has done this before.  </li>
<li>Scott Hansleman is a self-described <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ManagedSnobism.aspx">managed code snob</a>. What do you call the opposite of a managed code snob? An unmanaged code snob or a managed code bigot? </li>
