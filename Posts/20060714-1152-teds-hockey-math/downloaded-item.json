We got Linden as a part of the original Zednik trade, then traded him for the 1st round pick we used on Gordon. And of course, we started with Zednik, so that&#8217;s a wash. So the actual math goes <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nhl\/players\/profile?statsId=1485\">Zubrus<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nhl\/players\/profile?statsId=3170\">Gordon<\/a> for <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nhl\/players\/profile?statsId=1648\">Bulis<\/a>, a 2nd round pick (not sure who the Canucks got with that pick) and a 3rd round pick in next years draft. On paper, Bulis and Zubrus are close to a wash &#8211; Bulis had 20 goals and 40 points last season, Zubrus has 23 goals and 57 points. So that breaks the trade down to a 1st round pick (i.e. Gordon) for a 2nd and a 3rd. Not bad, but not mind blowing either.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, it&#8217;s nice to have Zed Head back in a Caps jersey. Hockey is played on ice, not paper. I&#8217;d rather have Zubrus and Zednick than Bulis and Linden any day.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>My new pal Ted Leonsis does the hockey math on the re-acquisition of Richard Zednik.
