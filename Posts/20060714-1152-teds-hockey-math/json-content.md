Actually, Ted’s math isn’t quite right. We got Linden as a part of the
original Zednik trade, then traded him for the 1st round pick we used on
Gordon. And of course, we started with Zednik, so that’s a wash. So the
actual math goes
[Zubrus](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?statsId=1485) and
[Gordon](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?statsId=3170) for
[Bulis](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?statsId=1648), a
2nd round pick (not sure who the Canucks got with that pick) and a 3rd
round pick in next years draft. On paper, Bulis and Zubrus are close to
a wash – Bulis had 20 goals and 40 points last season, Zubrus has 23
goals and 57 points. So that breaks the trade down to a 1st round pick
(i.e. Gordon) for a 2nd and a 3rd. Not bad, but not mind blowing either.

That being said, it’s nice to have Zed Head back in a Caps jersey.
Hockey is played on ice, not paper. I’d rather have Zubrus and Zednick
than Bulis and Linden any day.
