<p>Several languages, such as <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/node7.html#SECTION007300000000000000000">Python</a>, have the concept of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple#Usage_in_computer_science">Tuple</a> built into the lanugage.&nbsp;One of things it&#8217;s used for in Python is multiple return values. So you can call &#8220;return x,y&#8221; to return two values. Of course, C# can only return one. If you need to return more values, you have to define out parameters.</p>
<p>LINQ / C# 3.0 / VB 9 support the idea of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/vb9overview.asp?frame=true#vb9overview_topic5">anonymous types</a>, which is similar to a tuple. The big difference is that, because they&#8217;re anonymous, they can&#8217;t leave the scope they&#8217;re defined in. In other words, they&#8217;re great within a function, but if you want to pass them out of your function type-safely, you have to define a non-anonymous type for them.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">F#</a> supports <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/manual/quicktour.aspx#QuickTourTuples">tuples</a>, though it a bit of a hack. Since the CLR doesn&#8217;t support tuples, F# basically <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/manual/export-interop.aspx#Tuples">defines different Tuple classes</a> for up to seven tuple parameters (i.e. Tuple&lt;t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6,t7&gt;), For .NET 1.x, it&#8217;s even worse &#8211; they have to define different type names (Tuple2, Tuple3, etc). Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> &#8211; <a href="http://strangelights.com/blog/">Robert Pickering</a> pointed out that F#&#8217;s tuple implementation is entirely transparent&nbsp;inside of F#. He&#8217;s right &#8211; I was writing from the perspective of a C# developer using F#&#8217;s implementation of tuples. Maybe I need to be looking closer at F#?</p>
