At PDC03, the Architecture Symposium was one of the more popular and successful aspects of the overall confernece (though it was marred by a major room change issue that caused literally hundreds of attendees to be forced to watch from the hallway outside as the room was literally overflowing) and we&#8217;re looking to do something engaging again this year.<\/p>\n<p>Like last time, the Architecture Symposium will be held the last day of the conference, Friday from 8:30 until noon (with breaks of course). After lunch, we&#8217;ll have a panel discussion featuring <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hohpe.com\/Gregor\/index.html\">Gregor Hohpe<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.from9till2.com\/\">David Ing<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/h71019.www7.hp.com\/enterprise\/cache\/119482-0-0-0-121.html\">Tony Redmond<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/channel9.msdn.com\/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=56393\">Steve Swartz<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the full symposium abstract:<\/p>\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\"><p>You&#8217;ve had a tantalizing week of cool technology, but now you need to transition back to your real job: making all of the pieces work together. The PDC Architecture Symposium will zoom you through the solutions lifecycle &#8211; from requirements to modeling to requirements to iterative development to requirements to operational feedback (which you might look at as another set of requirements) &#8211; showing you how traditional best practices and recent innovations can be used together to build robust solutions that accelerate business value creation. <\/p>\n<p><b>Topics include:<\/b><br \/><em>The Architecture of Connected Systems<br \/><\/em>In the beginning there are the models &#8211; from the thing you scrawl on a napkin at lunch to that enormously complex diagram that your network architect carries around in a cardboard tube. What models are worth creating, and how do they relate to each other? Who are the key stakeholders for each, and how can you help them talk to each other? This session explores how to decompose value chains into your key models &#8211; your process and work flows, the information at the heart of your processes, and the access, deployment, and other operational models that you need to stay trustworthy and compliant. We will then map these models into a collection of services, orchestrations, and policies that define a highly integrated solution. <\/p>\n<p><em>Building Connected Systems<br \/><\/em>With so much complexity and so many stakeholders, how do you build the right thing on time? This session explores the techniques to iterate agilely through a connected system project, including the patterns and practices for building solutions that combine messaging, workflow, structured information, and human interaction across platforms and across organizational boundaries. How can we give the right access to everyone in the value chain, respecting the very real boundaries around information and process control? How do we keep our models current, and use them to communicate with all of the stakeholders throughout the development lifecycle? <\/p>\n<p><em>Managing the Connected Systems Lifecycle<br \/><\/em>As each iteration of your connected system is deployed and used, new requirements and system refinements emerge. How do we design in the operational hooks that give us the insight to learn from our deployed solutions? How do we re-factor and version our services and orchestrations to improve service reuse, scalability and operational efficiency? The key theme is driving collaboration between development and operations groups from the earliest design phase through the ongoing maintenance of the system. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As Michael said on the buzzcast, you just can&#8217;t miss the Architecture Symposium.
