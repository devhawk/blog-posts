<p>I&#8217;m trying to set up a community site for some old friends from high school. Got the domain name, got the hosting space, just need to figure out what to run on the site. </p>
<p>I started by looking the old IBuySpy portal. It&#8217;s been a while &#8211; it&#8217;s now called the <a href="http://www.ibuyspy.com/PortalStarterKit/DesktopDefault.aspx">ASP.NET Portal Starter Kit</a>. Looks as good as it did when it first came out. However, there&#8217;s a slight security issue. My hoster doesn&#8217;t allow unauthenticated write access to the file system. Most of the ASP.NET Portal data is stored in the database, however the actual site layout is stored in an <a href="http://www.ibuyspy.com/PortalStarterKit/sourceviewer/srcview.aspx?path=webconfig.src&file=PortalCfg.xml&rows=2">on-disk XML file</a>. I could work around this by setting up a portal on my local machine, building out the site, and then uploading the relevant xml file, but I want to have my good friend back east help manage the site, so that workaround does&#8217;t work too well.</p>
<p>Next choice was <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a>. They&#8217;re about to release their 3.0 version (3.0.11 is supposed to be the final beta). Looks really nice and installed very easily on my local testbed. However, my hoster also doesn&#8217;t give my DB account owner rights &#8211; I get reader, writer, DDL and security admin but not owner. DNN installs a series of stored procedures (which works on my machine due to having DDL permissions) but doesn&#8217;t give EXEC permissions to those procs to anyone except DBO. Woops. I wrote a small utility app that extracts a list of all user stored procs and calls &#8220;GRANT EXEC ON &lt;&lt;SPNAME&gt;&gt; TO PUBLIC&#8221; on each one. Seems to work fine, but given the size of the DNN codebase, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m comfortable that there isn&#8217;t something else out there that&#8217;s expecting DBO permissions.</p>
<p>Assuming I don&#8217;t go with ASP.NET Portal or DNN, what other choices do I have? I&#8217;ve got pretty stringint security requirements, plus it has to use ASP.NET (go figure). I&#8217;m still looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rainbowportal.net">Rainbow Portal</a> &#8211; similar to DNN in that it started from the original ASP.NET Portal source code</li>
<li><a href="http://asp.net/StarterKits/StarterKitRedirect.aspx?Item=CommunityLive">ASP.NET Community Starter Kit</a>&nbsp;(CSK) &#8211; A baseline starter kit for building a community oriented site. Sounds promising.</li>
<li><a href="http://gotcommunitynet.com/">GotCommunityNet</a> &#8211; derivative of the community starter kit. They bill themselves as CSK 1.1. Sounds even more promising.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>
