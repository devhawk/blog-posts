Some other ‘softies blogging OOPSLA:

-   Keith Short [talks
    about](http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2004/10/27/248583.aspx)
    the DSL Tutorial and apologizes for our keynote demo.
-   Steve Cook [talks about](http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook) the MDA
    panel and says the keynote demo “wasn’t such a great idea”
-   Stuart Kent [describes the DSL
    Toolkit](http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2004/10/27/248260.aspx)
    and calls the keynote demo a “commercial break”
-   Michael Lehman briefly [describes his
    work](http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/10/27/248491.aspx)
    building a software factory for the DSL Tutorial and
    [blogs](http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/10/27/248580.aspx)
    Jack’s GPCE keynote presentation on Software Factories

Finally, Brant Carter [took me to
task](http://devhawk.net/CommentView.aspx?guid=d48de680-85be-482e-b403-be3885717050)
for pointing out that Alan Kay ended his Turing Lecture with a product
demo. Brant makes good points and I agree with all him. I think all the
‘softies blogging OOPSLA have acknowledged how poorly this went and I
certainly didn’t mean to imply that somehow we were vindicated by Alan’s
demoing stuff in his lecture. I plan on giving Squeak a deep look when I
get some free time – I have an 18 month old son so Alan’s lecture on
teaching computer science resonated with me.
