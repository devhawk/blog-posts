<li>Do you use external/flash drives? Do you have issues when you try to &#8220;Safely Remove Hardware&#8221; with said drive? I do, all the time. Apparently, <a href="http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/">unlocker</a> is the answer.

<li>How come there&#8217;s no information about LogToTraceListeners in the WF documentation? As far as I can tell, it&#8217;s not in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C2B1E300-F358-4523-B479-F53D234CDCCF&displaylang=en">Windows SDK</a> docs at all and the only reference to it on MSDN is <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa663362.aspx">this year-old article</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sonalic/archive/2006/04/29/586838.aspx">this year-old blog post</a>. I only discovered because someone on the internal WF discussion alias asked about it. I&#8217;ve added In my SSB/WF work, I subclassed the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.workflow.runtime.hosting.sqlworkflowpersistenceservice.aspx">built-in SQL persistence service</a> in order to add tracing support. If you&#8217;re developing a WF host, you <em>need </em>to turn this on. I find it mind-boggling this isn&#8217;t included anywhere in the official WF docs.

<li>Nice to see Soma <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/01/26/software-factories-100-000-served.aspx">bragging about Software Factories</a>. As he writes, our current solution &#8211; consisting of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718948.aspx">Guidance Automation Toolkit</a> and the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718368.aspx">DSL Tools</a>&nbsp;- are really just a first step. I&#8217;m just starting to experiment with the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480534.aspx">Web Service Software Factory (WSSF)</a>. <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/">Aaron Skonnard</a> introduces both the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/12/ServiceStation/default.aspx">ASMX</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/02/ServiceStation/">WCF</a> version in his two most recent Service Station articles.

<li>Michael.NET makes <a href="http://michaeldotnet.blogspot.com/2007/01/programming-promises.html">Programming Promises</a> and Ted Neward swears the <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/01/27/Programming+Promises+Or+The+Professional+Programmers+Hippocratic+Oath.aspx">Oath of the Conscientious Programmer</a>. Why stop there? How about the Architect&#8217;s Affidavit to actually implement the shit we draw on the white board? The Technologist&#8217;s Testimony of understanding and belief in all things geeky and gadget? Come on, isn&#8217;t this just called &#8220;doing your job&#8221;? Do we really need to make promises and swear oaths to take it seriously and do it to the best of our abilities? </li>
