-   I find [Jim Kobielus’](http://jkobielus.blogspot.com/) “[SOA as 50
    square miles of fungus](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gardner/?p=2405)”
    analogy funny and strangely compelling. The “keep in the dark and
    feed it shit” jokes practically write themselves. (via [Joe
    McKendrick](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=806))
-   [Politics 2.0
    Rising](http://pewresearch.org/pubs/280/election-2006-online): The
    number of Americans who got “most of their information” about the
    2006 midterm elections was double the number from the 2002
    elections.
-   Do you use external/flash drives? Do you have issues when you try to
    “Safely Remove Hardware” with said drive? I do, all the time.
    Apparently, [unlocker](http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/) is the
    answer. (via [Paul
    Andrew](http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2007/01/15/unlocker-utility-for-ejecting-usb-drives.aspx))
-   How come there’s no information about LogToTraceListeners in the WF
    documentation? As far as I can tell, it’s not in the [Windows
    SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C2B1E300-F358-4523-B479-F53D234CDCCF&displaylang=en)
    docs at all and the only reference to it on MSDN is [this year-old
    article](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa663362.aspx) and
    [this year-old blog
    post](http://blogs.msdn.com/sonalic/archive/2006/04/29/586838.aspx).
    I only discovered because someone on the internal WF discussion
    alias asked about it. I’ve added In my SSB/WF work, I subclassed the
    [built-in SQL persistence
    service](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.workflow.runtime.hosting.sqlworkflowpersistenceservice.aspx)
    in order to add tracing support. If you’re developing a WF host, you
    *need* to turn this on. I find it mind-boggling this isn’t included
    anywhere in the official WF docs.
-   Nice to see Soma [bragging about Software
    Factories](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/01/26/software-factories-100-000-served.aspx).
    As he writes, our current solution – consisting of the [Guidance
    Automation
    Toolkit](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718948.aspx)
    and the [DSL
    Tools](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718368.aspx) -
    are really just a first step. I’m just starting to experiment with
    the [Web Service Software Factory
    (WSSF)](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480534.aspx).
    [Aaron Skonnard](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/) introduces
    both the
    [ASMX](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/12/ServiceStation/default.aspx)
    and
    [WCF](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/02/ServiceStation/)
    version in his two most recent Service Station articles.
-   Michael.NET makes [Programming
    Promises](http://michaeldotnet.blogspot.com/2007/01/programming-promises.html)
    and Ted Neward swears the [Oath of the Conscientious
    Programmer](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/01/27/Programming+Promises+Or+The+Professional+Programmers+Hippocratic+Oath.aspx).
    Why stop there? How about the Architect’s Affidavit to actually
    implement the shit we draw on the white board? The Technologist’s
    Testimony of understanding and belief in all things geeky and
    gadget? Come on, isn’t this just called “doing your job”? Do we
    really need to make promises and swear oaths to take it seriously
    and do it to the best of our abilities?
