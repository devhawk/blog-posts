</li><li>Do you use external/flash drives? Do you have issues when you try to "Safely Remove Hardware" with said drive? I do, all the time. Apparently, <a href="http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/">unlocker</a> is the answer.

</li><li>How come there's no information about LogToTraceListeners in the WF documentation? As far as I can tell, it's not in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C2B1E300-F358-4523-B479-F53D234CDCCF&amp;displaylang=en">Windows SDK</a> docs at all and the only reference to it on MSDN is <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa663362.aspx">this year-old article</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sonalic/archive/2006/04/29/586838.aspx">this year-old blog post</a>. I only discovered because someone on the internal WF discussion alias asked about it. I've added In my SSB/WF work, I subclassed the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.workflow.runtime.hosting.sqlworkflowpersistenceservice.aspx">built-in SQL persistence service</a> in order to add tracing support. If you're developing a WF host, you <em>need </em>to turn this on. I find it mind-boggling this isn't included anywhere in the official WF docs. 
</li><li>Nice to see Soma <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/01/26/software-factories-100-000-served.aspx">bragging about Software Factories</a>. As he writes, our current solution - consisting of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718948.aspx">Guidance Automation Toolkit</a> and the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718368.aspx">DSL Tools</a> - are really just a first step.

Why stop there? How about the Architect's Affidavit to actually implement the shit we draw on the white board? The Technologist's Testimony of understanding and belief in all things geeky and gadget? Come on, isn't this just called "doing your job"? Do we really need to make promises and swear oaths to take it seriously and do it to the best of our abilities? </li></ul>
