Almost exactly year ago, my life was changed forever by the <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=16e48c40-21ed-480f-a51f-70f88755901f">arrival</a> of my son Patrick. I tried to approach my imendingÂ fatherhood with an open mind, realizing that my life was going to change but not really sure exactly how. So far, I think I'm doing pretty well. Today, Patrick is walking (in spurts), talking (in gibberish mostly), eating solid foods and otherwise making everyone around him smile. I don't write as much code, play as much XBOX or read for fun as much as I used to, but I do seem to smile a lot more.

I am truly blessed to have such an amazing <a href="http://techiewife.com/">wife</a>, son and job.
