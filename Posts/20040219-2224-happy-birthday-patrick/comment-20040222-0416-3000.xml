  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Congrats, Harry!  Sounds like Patrick is mostly taking after his dad ("walking (in spurts) talking (in gibberish mostly) eating solid foods and otherwise making everyone around him smile".

OK, maybe except for the smile thing (grin).  I think he gets that quality from his mom.

Best to you, Jules and your whole family.  Enjoy it - the little ones grow up so quickly.  Make all the memories you can...
