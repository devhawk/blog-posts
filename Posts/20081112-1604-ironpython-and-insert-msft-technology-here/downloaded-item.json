One of the things I\u2019m looking at is making IronPython work with a variety of Microsoft technologies. Given the usage of dynamic languages in web scenarios, most of our focus to date has been on using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/sdlsdk\">Iron languages in Silverlight<\/a>. Being able to program the browser with the same language you program the server is a fairly compelling scenario. We\u2019re also starting to see new progress on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/aspnet\/Wiki\/View.aspx?title=Dynamic%20Language%20Support\">ASP.NET support for Iron languages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But those are only two out of a veritable universe of cool technologies. Now that I\u2019m done with PDC, I can start to explore some of the others. Some ideas include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>IPy and WPF<\/li>\n<li>IPy and Surface<\/li>\n<li>IPy and XNA (desktop only \u2013 Xbox and Zune use the Compact Framework with doesn\u2019t support DLR)<\/li>\n<li>IPy and WCF<\/li>\n<li>IPy and WF<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Any other suggestions?
