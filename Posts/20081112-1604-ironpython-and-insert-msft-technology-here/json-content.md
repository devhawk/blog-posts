Now that PDC08 is in my rear view mirror, I’m back to doing IronPython
stuff. One of the things I’m looking at is making IronPython work with a
variety of Microsoft technologies. Given the usage of dynamic languages
in web scenarios, most of our focus to date has been on using [Iron
languages in Silverlight](http://www.codeplex.com/sdlsdk). Being able to
program the browser with the same language you program the server is a
fairly compelling scenario. We’re also starting to see new progress on
[ASP.NET support for Iron
languages](http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Dynamic%20Language%20Support).

But those are only two out of a veritable universe of cool technologies.
Now that I’m done with PDC, I can start to explore some of the others.
Some ideas include:

-   IPy and WPF
-   IPy and Surface
-   IPy and XNA (desktop only – Xbox and Zune use the Compact Framework
    with doesn’t support DLR)
-   IPy and WCF
-   IPy and WF

Any other suggestions? Please leave them in the comments.
