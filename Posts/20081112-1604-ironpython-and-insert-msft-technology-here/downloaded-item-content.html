<p>Now that PDC08 is in my rear view mirror, I&#8217;m back to doing IronPython stuff. One of the things I&#8217;m looking at is making IronPython work with a variety of Microsoft technologies. Given the usage of dynamic languages in web scenarios, most of our focus to date has been on using <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sdlsdk">Iron languages in Silverlight</a>. Being able to program the browser with the same language you program the server is a fairly compelling scenario. We&#8217;re also starting to see new progress on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Dynamic%20Language%20Support">ASP.NET support for Iron languages</a>.</p>
<p>But those are only two out of a veritable universe of cool technologies. Now that I&#8217;m done with PDC, I can start to explore some of the others. Some ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IPy and WPF</li>
<li>IPy and Surface</li>
<li>IPy and XNA (desktop only &#8211; Xbox and Zune use the Compact Framework with doesn&#8217;t support DLR)</li>
<li>IPy and WCF</li>
<li>IPy and WF</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other suggestions? Please leave them in the comments. </p>
