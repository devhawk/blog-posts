<p>It&#8217;s a slow Thursday. </p>
<ul>
<li>BPEL 2.0 <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/news/oasis-news-2007-04-12.php">has been approved</a> as an OASIS standard. John Evdemon from my old team <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2007/04/12/ws-bpel-2-0-approved-as-an-oasis-standard.aspx">has the details</a>. As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/03/01/Late+Morning+Coffee+36.aspx">written before</a>, I think the spec is too heavily focused on executable process and not enough on abstract process. But I guess congrats are in order none the less.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2 v2</a> is out. Unfortunately, it still doesn&#8217;t support user defined syntax schemes. I wonder if the switch from&nbsp;GPL to BSD license might encourage someone to add that support? (via <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1119.aspx">Larkware</a>)</li>
