It’s a slow Thursday.

-   BPEL 2.0 [has been
    approved](http://www.oasis-open.org/news/oasis-news-2007-04-12.php)
    as an OASIS standard. John Evdemon from my old team [has the
    details](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2007/04/12/ws-bpel-2-0-approved-as-an-oasis-standard.aspx).
    As I’ve [written
    before](http://devhawk.net/2007/03/01/Late+Morning+Coffee+36.aspx),
    I think the spec is too heavily focused on executable process and
    not enough on abstract process. But I guess congrats are in order
    none the less.
-   [Notepad2 v2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) is out.
    Unfortunately, it still doesn’t support user defined syntax schemes.
    I wonder if the switch from GPL to BSD license might encourage
    someone to add that support? (via
