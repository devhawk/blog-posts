I was able to catch an earlier flight home last night (which was itself
delayed, but still got me home an hour and a half earlier than
expected). Combined with the work that piled up while I was gone and I
haven’t gotten around to the rest of my thoughts on Mashup Camp. Until
now…

-   This should have been in the [day one
    update](http://devhawk.net/2006/02/21/Thoughts+From+Mashup+Camp+Day+1.aspx),
    but we had a great presentation Monday night on the History of
    Computer Marketing. Very interesting and very entertaining.
-   It was good to see [Marc
    Canter](http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/02/making-the-scene-at-mashup-camp).
-   There were fewer sessions on Tuesday because a significant amount of
    time was taken up on “speed geeking”. Supposedly similar to speed
    dating, but with mashup demos instead of dates. In actuality, it was
    more like demo anarchy with loud annoying buzzing.
-   I spent a significant time with the folks from [Bungee
    Labs](http://www.bungeelabs.com/) (no relation to the [makers of
    Halo](http://www.bungie.net/)). Like Ning, they are a web / mashup
    development site. However, where Ning appears to be going after the
    hobbyist, Bungee Labs is going after the enterprise. They had a cool
    demo of a SalesForce.com & Exchange mashup with maps.
-   I was very impressed with
    [WeatherBonk](http://www.weatherbonk.com/). In particular, the way
    they overlay the map with radar and fog information. They also make
    [SkiBonk](http://www.skibonk.com/).
-   I sat in on the [Microformats Specification
    Work](http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?HAtomFinalization)
    session, but didn’t get much out of it as it was a face-to-face
    meeting of core microformats folks rather than the “What are
    [Microformats”
    session](http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?MicroFormats) that I
    didn’t make the first day (conflict with [Mashup Business Model
    session](http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?MonetizationBizModels))
-   There was a session on Firefox futures, but it was lame. You can get
    more from just reading the [Firefox 2 product
    planning](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox:2.0_Product_Planning) wiki
    page. Interestingly enough, if you look at their [list of
    features](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox2/Features) for Firefox 2,
    only one is of any use to the web developer: In-line Spell Check.
    Everything else improves the chrome. Their priority one features
    are: [new bookmark and history
    system](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Places), [tabbed browsing UI
    improvements](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Tabbed_Browsing), extension
    manager enhancements, [search engine UI
    improvements](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Search_Service), and an update
    to the  browser appearance. As I wrote in [Browser as
    VM](http://devhawk.net/2006/02/03/Browser+As+Virtual+Machine.aspx),
    we’ve reached an inertia point where it’s hard for a browser vendor
    to add new proprietary capabilities that only work on their browser.
    Same goes for Microsoft – read the [IE7 Technology
    Overview](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B2AC8F30-2D88-45B6-90AE-ED266161F463&displaylang=en)
    and while there is great work on things like security and the RSS
    platform, there are no new web developer feature, just bug fixes,
    better standards support and a native XmlHttpRequest object. I
    wonder what it’s going to take to get new capabilities added to
    arguably the most important virtual machine platform in the world.
-   [Podbop](http://podbop.org/) won the mashup contest. [Chicago
    Crime](http://www.chicagocrime.org/) came in second. Frankly, I was
    much more impressed with Chicago Crime.
-   As the winner of the mashup contest, the guy that wrote Podbop got a
    Sun server. Second prize was a new intel-based Mac. And ten third
    place finishers got copies of Visual Studio Pro. Given that none of
    the mashup content entrants were built on Microsoft technology, I’d
    be interested to know how excited the third place finishers were
    about getting a copy of VS.
-   I met a lot of great people at Mashup Camp (which is the primary
    reason I went) but above all I really got a lot out of hanging out
    with the MS folks who were there. We’re such a big company that it’s
    hard to keep abreast of what’s going on, so this kind of
    face-to-face time is invaluable.

That’s it, at least until [Mashup Camp
2](http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?MashupCamp2).
