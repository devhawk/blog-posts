Combined with the work that piled up while I was gone and I haven&#8217;t gotten around to the rest of my thoughts on Mashup Camp. Until now&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>This should have been in the <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/02\/21\/Thoughts+From+Mashup+Camp+Day+1.aspx\">day one update<\/a>, but we had a great presentation Monday night on the History of Computer Marketing. Very interesting and very entertaining. <\/li>\n<li>It was good to see <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.broadbandmechanics.com\/2006\/02\/making-the-scene-at-mashup-camp\">Marc Canter<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>There were fewer sessions on Tuesday because a significant amount of time was taken up on &#8220;speed geeking&#8221;. Supposedly similar to speed dating, but with mashup demos instead of dates. In actuality, it was more like demo anarchy with loud annoying buzzing. <\/li>\n<li>I spent a significant time with the folks from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bungeelabs.com\/\">Bungee Labs<\/a> (no relation to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bungie.net\/\">makers of Halo<\/a>). Like Ning, they are a web \/ mashup development site. However, where Ning appears to be going after the hobbyist, Bungee Labs is going after the enterprise. They had a cool demo of a SalesForce.com &amp; Exchange mashup with maps. <\/li>\n<li>I was very impressed with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.weatherbonk.com\/\">WeatherBonk<\/a>. In particular, the way they overlay the map with radar and fog information. They also make <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skibonk.com\/\">SkiBonk<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>I sat in on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mashupcamp.com\/index.cgi?HAtomFinalization\">Microformats Specification Work<\/a> session, but didn&#8217;t get much out of it as it was a face-to-face meeting of core microformats folks rather than the &#8220;What are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mashupcamp.com\/index.cgi?MicroFormats\">Microformats&#8221; session<\/a> that I didn&#8217;t make the first day (conflict with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mashupcamp.com\/index.cgi?MonetizationBizModels\">Mashup Business Model session<\/a>) <\/li>\n<li>There was a session on Firefox futures, but it was lame. You can get more from just reading the <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.mozilla.org\/Firefox:2.0_Product_Planning\">Firefox 2 product planning<\/a> wiki page. Interestingly enough, if you look at their <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.mozilla.org\/Firefox2\/Features\">list of features<\/a> for Firefox 2, only one is of any use to the web developer: In-line Spell Check. Everything else improves the chrome. Their priority one features are: <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.mozilla.org\/Places\">new bookmark and history system<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.mozilla.org\/Tabbed_Browsing\">tabbed browsing UI improvements<\/a>, extension manager enhancements, <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.mozilla.org\/Search_Service\">search engine UI improvements<\/a>, and an update to the\u00a0 browser appearance. As I wrote in <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2006\/02\/03\/Browser+As+Virtual+Machine.aspx\">Browser as VM<\/a>, we&#8217;ve reached an inertia point where it&#8217;s hard for a browser vendor to add new proprietary capabilities that only work on their browser. Same goes for Microsoft &#8211; read the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/downloads\/details.aspx?FamilyId=B2AC8F30-2D88-45B6-90AE-ED266161F463&amp;displaylang=en\">IE7 Technology Overview<\/a> and while there is great work on things like security and the RSS platform, there are no new web developer feature, just bug fixes, better standards support and a native XmlHttpRequest object. I wonder what it&#8217;s going to take to get new capabilities added to arguably the most important virtual machine platform in the world.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/podbop.org\/\">Podbop<\/a> won the mashup contest. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chicagocrime.org\/\">Chicago Crime<\/a> came in second. Frankly, I was much more impressed with Chicago Crime.<\/li>\n<li>As the winner of the mashup contest, the guy that wrote Podbop got a Sun server. Second prize was a new intel-based Mac. And ten third place finishers got copies of Visual Studio Pro. Given that none of the mashup content entrants were built on Microsoft technology, I&#8217;d be interested to know how excited the third place finishers were about getting a copy of VS.<\/li>\n<li>I met a lot of great people at Mashup Camp (which is the primary reason I went) but above all I really got a lot out of hanging out with the MS folks who were there. We&#8217;re such a big company that it&#8217;s hard to keep abreast of what&#8217;s going on, so this kind of face-to-face time is invaluable. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s it, at least until <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mashupcamp.com\/index.cgi?MashupCamp2\">Mashup Camp 2<\/a>.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I was able to catch an earlier flight home last night (which was itself delayed, but still got me home an hour and a half earlier than expected).
