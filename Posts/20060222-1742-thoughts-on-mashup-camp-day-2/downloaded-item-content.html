<p>I was able to catch an earlier flight home last night (which was itself delayed, but still got me home an hour and a half earlier than expected). Combined with the work that piled up while I was gone and I haven&#8217;t gotten around to the rest of my thoughts on Mashup Camp. Until now&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>This should have been in the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/21/Thoughts+From+Mashup+Camp+Day+1.aspx">day one update</a>, but we had a great presentation Monday night on the History of Computer Marketing. Very interesting and very entertaining. </li>
<li>It was good to see <a href="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/02/making-the-scene-at-mashup-camp">Marc Canter</a>.</li>
<li>There were fewer sessions on Tuesday because a significant amount of time was taken up on &#8220;speed geeking&#8221;. Supposedly similar to speed dating, but with mashup demos instead of dates. In actuality, it was more like demo anarchy with loud annoying buzzing. </li>
<li>I spent a significant time with the folks from <a href="http://www.bungeelabs.com/">Bungee Labs</a> (no relation to the <a href="http://www.bungie.net/">makers of Halo</a>). Like Ning, they are a web / mashup development site. However, where Ning appears to be going after the hobbyist, Bungee Labs is going after the enterprise. They had a cool demo of a SalesForce.com &amp; Exchange mashup with maps. </li>
<li>I was very impressed with <a href="http://www.weatherbonk.com/">WeatherBonk</a>. In particular, the way they overlay the map with radar and fog information. They also make <a href="http://www.skibonk.com/">SkiBonk</a>.</li>
<li>I sat in on the <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?HAtomFinalization">Microformats Specification Work</a> session, but didn&#8217;t get much out of it as it was a face-to-face meeting of core microformats folks rather than the &#8220;What are <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?MicroFormats">Microformats&#8221; session</a> that I didn&#8217;t make the first day (conflict with <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?MonetizationBizModels">Mashup Business Model session</a>) </li>
<li>There was a session on Firefox futures, but it was lame. You can get more from just reading the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox:2.0_Product_Planning">Firefox 2 product planning</a> wiki page. Interestingly enough, if you look at their <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox2/Features">list of features</a> for Firefox 2, only one is of any use to the web developer: In-line Spell Check. Everything else improves the chrome. Their priority one features are: <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Places">new bookmark and history system</a>, <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Tabbed_Browsing">tabbed browsing UI improvements</a>, extension manager enhancements, <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Search_Service">search engine UI improvements</a>, and an update to the&nbsp; browser appearance. As I wrote in <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/03/Browser+As+Virtual+Machine.aspx">Browser as VM</a>, we&#8217;ve reached an inertia point where it&#8217;s hard for a browser vendor to add new proprietary capabilities that only work on their browser. Same goes for Microsoft &#8211; read the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B2AC8F30-2D88-45B6-90AE-ED266161F463&displaylang=en">IE7 Technology Overview</a> and while there is great work on things like security and the RSS platform, there are no new web developer feature, just bug fixes, better standards support and a native XmlHttpRequest object. I wonder what it&#8217;s going to take to get new capabilities added to arguably the most important virtual machine platform in the world.</li>
<li><a href="http://podbop.org/">Podbop</a> won the mashup contest. <a href="http://www.chicagocrime.org/">Chicago Crime</a> came in second. Frankly, I was much more impressed with Chicago Crime.</li>
<li>As the winner of the mashup contest, the guy that wrote Podbop got a Sun server. Second prize was a new intel-based Mac. And ten third place finishers got copies of Visual Studio Pro. Given that none of the mashup content entrants were built on Microsoft technology, I&#8217;d be interested to know how excited the third place finishers were about getting a copy of VS.</li>
<li>I met a lot of great people at Mashup Camp (which is the primary reason I went) but above all I really got a lot out of hanging out with the MS folks who were there. We&#8217;re such a big company that it&#8217;s hard to keep abreast of what&#8217;s going on, so this kind of face-to-face time is invaluable. </li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it, at least until <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/index.cgi?MashupCamp2">Mashup Camp 2</a>.</p>
