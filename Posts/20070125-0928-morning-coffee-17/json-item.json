Lots more on this <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.asp.net\/scottgu\/archive\/2007\/01\/23\/asp-net-ajax-1-0-released.aspx\">from Scott Guthrie&#8217;s blog<\/a>. While I&#8217;m not personally that interested in ASP.NET AJAX itself, two things strike me as interesting in this release. First, we&#8217;re shipping <em>all <\/em>the code for this. The client side JavaScript library, the <a href=\"http:\/\/ajax.asp.net\/ajaxtoolkit\/\">Control Toolkit<\/a>, even the server-side components. Second, it&#8217;s nice to see the Developer Division shipping something this significant <em>without<\/em> waiting for the next release of Visual Studio. Here&#8217;s hoping that both of these two trends continue.  <\/li>\n<li>Rich McCollister <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/CommentView,guid,5f743d1c-4edd-4319-8980-5f12b7397e60.aspx#commentstart\">pointed me<\/a> to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplex.com\/XmlProviderLibrary\">XmlProviderLibrary<\/a>. Bad on me for not looking harder.  <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/ideas.live.com\/programpage.aspx?versionid=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1&amp;pageId=0\">Windows Live Writer<\/a> is pretty cool, but it is missing one feature that I needed twice Tuesday. While embedding images in a post is cake, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a way to embed non-image files. You know, like the <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/01\/24\/DevHawkColorConsoleTraceListener.aspx\">ColorConsoleTraceListener Project<\/a>\u00a0or the <a href=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/2007\/01\/23\/Live+Search+For+Charity.aspx\">Live Search for Chartity Search Providers<\/a>. I&#8217;m guessing the infrastructure to post images and files would be identical, but there&#8217;s no UI interface for it. I checked out the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/aa738906.aspx\">WLW SDK online<\/a> and found the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/library\/aa738940.aspx\">ISmartContent.Files.Add<\/a> method, so I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s doable. But there&#8217;s no such animal on the <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.live.com\/default.aspx?l=8\">Live Gallery<\/a>. I wonder why nobody else has built this yet? Is this really that unique a request?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Yesterday&#8217;s Morning Coffee was canceled on account of barfing.
