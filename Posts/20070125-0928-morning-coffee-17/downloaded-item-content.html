<p>Yesterday&#8217;s Morning Coffee was canceled on account of barfing. For all the gory details (you have been warned), check out <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!641.entry">my wife&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>

<li>Only <a href="http://youtube.com/groups_videos?name=tpmsotu">12 responses</a> to the State of the Union were posted as I write this. Dunno why, but I was expecting more. Maybe this whole Web 2.0 thing <em>is </em>overblown a bit! <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group863" alt=":)">  </li>
<li>Speaking of the State of the Union, is it just me, or did anyone else find it odd that the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16770023/">Scooter Libby trial</a> started the same day?  </li>
<li><strike>Atlas</strike><a href="http://ajax.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47">ASP.NET AJAX 1.0</a> is done. Lots more on this <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/01/23/asp-net-ajax-1-0-released.aspx">from Scott Guthrie&#8217;s blog</a>. While I&#8217;m not personally that interested in ASP.NET AJAX itself, two things strike me as interesting in this release. First, we&#8217;re shipping <em>all </em>the code for this. The client side JavaScript library, the <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/ajaxtoolkit/">Control Toolkit</a>, even the server-side components. Second, it&#8217;s nice to see the Developer Division shipping something this significant <em>without</em> waiting for the next release of Visual Studio. Here&#8217;s hoping that both of these two trends continue.  </li>
<li>Rich McCollister <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,5f743d1c-4edd-4319-8980-5f12b7397e60.aspx#commentstart">pointed me</a> to the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/XmlProviderLibrary">XmlProviderLibrary</a>. Bad on me for not looking harder.  </li>
<li><a href="http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionid=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1&pageId=0">Windows Live Writer</a> is pretty cool, but it is missing one feature that I needed twice Tuesday. While embedding images in a post is cake, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a way to embed non-image files. You know, like the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/24/DevHawkColorConsoleTraceListener.aspx">ColorConsoleTraceListener Project</a>&nbsp;or the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/23/Live+Search+For+Charity.aspx">Live Search for Chartity Search Providers</a>. I&#8217;m guessing the infrastructure to post images and files would be identical, but there&#8217;s no UI interface for it. I checked out the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa738906.aspx">WLW SDK online</a> and found the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa738940.aspx">ISmartContent.Files.Add</a> method, so I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s doable. But there&#8217;s no such animal on the <a href="http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?l=8">Live Gallery</a>. I wonder why nobody else has built this yet? Is this really that unique a request?</li>
