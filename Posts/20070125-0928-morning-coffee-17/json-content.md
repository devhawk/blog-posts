Yesterday’s Morning Coffee was canceled on account of barfing. For all
the gory details (you have been warned), check out [my wife’s
blog](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!641.entry).

    to the State of the Union were posted as I write this. Dunno why,
    but I was expecting more. Maybe this whole Web 2.0 thing *is*
    overblown a bit!
    :smile:
-   Speaking of the State of the Union, is it just me, or did anyone
    else find it odd that the [Scooter Libby
    trial](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16770023/) started the same day?
-   ~~Atlas~~[ASP.NET AJAX
    1.0](http://ajax.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47) is done. Lots more
    on this [from Scott Guthrie’s
    blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/01/23/asp-net-ajax-1-0-released.aspx).
    While I’m not personally that interested in ASP.NET AJAX itself, two
    things strike me as interesting in this release. First, we’re
    shipping *all* the code for this. The client side JavaScript
    library, the [Control Toolkit](http://ajax.asp.net/ajaxtoolkit/),
    even the server-side components. Second, it’s nice to see the
    Developer Division shipping something this significant *without*
    waiting for the next release of Visual Studio. Here’s hoping that
    both of these two trends continue.

    to the

    Bad on me for not looking harder.

    is pretty cool, but it is missing one feature that I needed twice
    Tuesday. While embedding images in a post is cake, there doesn’t
    seem to be a way to embed non-image files. You know, like the
    [ColorConsoleTraceListener
    Project](http://devhawk.net/2007/01/24/DevHawkColorConsoleTraceListener.aspx) or
    the [Live Search for Chartity Search
    Providers](http://devhawk.net/2007/01/23/Live+Search+For+Charity.aspx).
    I’m guessing the infrastructure to post images and files would be
    identical, but there’s no UI interface for it. I checked out the
    [WLW SDK
    online](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa738906.aspx) and
    found the
    [ISmartContent.Files.Add](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa738940.aspx)
    method, so I’m guessing it’s doable. But there’s no such animal on
    the [Live Gallery](http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?l=8). I
    wonder why nobody else has built this yet? Is this really that
    unique a request?
