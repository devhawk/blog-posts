I was on IM with a friend from LA a couple of days ago. He asked what I
was listening to. So I thought I’d give a quick rundown on the albums
loaded in my Nomad. I know everyone is all ga-ga over the
[iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/) but I really like my [Nomad
IIc](http://nomadworld.com/products/nomad2c/). It’s got 256MB of
storage, giving me enough for about 6 albums in 96kbit WMA format. I
actually like the fact that I don’t bring my whole music collection with
me. It gives me a chance to proactively choose some music that I haven’t
listened to in a while.

[The Uninvited](http://www.uninvited.com) – [Teenage Dance

[Pat McGee Band](http://www.patmcgeeband.com/) –
[Shine](http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?album=113957)

> This is a friend by family band. My brother introduced me to these
> guys. Sorta Dave Mathews-ish, but better IMO. Like Dave, Pat Mcgee
> Band encourages their fans to [tape and trade live
> shows](http://pub76.ezboard.com/bpatmcgeeband72753), which is pretty
> cool. Shine is their latest and their first label album (Giant/Warner
> Bros.). Favorite Song: Minute.

[Reel Big Fish](http://www.reel-big-fish.com/) – [Cheer
Up](http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?album=641547)

> I’m a sucker for horns, so I love ska. This album isn’t as good as
> their previous two, but it’s not bad. I haven’t listened to it in a
> while which is why it made in onto my Nomad. Favorite Song: Suckers.

[Uncle Kracker](http://www.unclekracker.com/) – [No Stranger To
Shame](http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?album=653721)

> While I don’t like straight up rap, I do tend to like cross over
> stuff. Uncle Kracker got his start off Kid Rock’s fame, but then hit
> on his own with Follow Me. While the first track of Shame (and hidden
> last track) are rap crossover, the rest of the album is pretty bluesy,
> obviously trying to capture the sound of Follow Me. They have a good
> cover of Drift Away, but my Favorite Song: I Do (as I said, sucker for
> horns)

[David Lee Roth](http://www.davidleeroth.com) – [A Little Ain’t
Enough](http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?album=592706)

> Overshadowed by the release of [Van
> Halen’s](http://entertainment.msn.com/artist/?artist=101396)
> [For Unlawful Carnal
> Knowledge](http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?album=103078) the same
> year, this is a great, if underrated, album. With the exception of
> Right Now, every song on Knowledge is entirely forgettable. But I dig
> pretty much everything on A Little Ain’t Enough.. Need to check out
> his latest: [Diamond
> Dave](http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?album=689047). Favorite
> Song: Hammerhead Shark.

[Linkin Park](http://www.linkinpark.com/) –
[Meteora](http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?album=675215)

> I haven’t given this one enough listens yet. I liked [Hybrid
> Theory](http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?album=121913) and so far I
> like what I hear of Meteora. Favorite Song (so far): Somewhere I
> Belong.
