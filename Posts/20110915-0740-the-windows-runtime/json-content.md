After nearly 2 years of not being able to tell anyone what I was working
on – or even the name of the team I was on! –
[//build](http://www.buildwindows.com/) is finally here and the [Windows
8 developer
preview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516) is
finally out there in the open for everyone to start building
applications for. You have NO idea how hard it’s been for me to keep my
mouth shut and blog quiet about this!

I am a program manager on the Runtime Experience team, one of [many
teams](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/08/17/introducing-the-team.aspx)
in the Windows division building Windows 8. Our team is responsible for
building the underlying infrastructure that powers the [Windows
Runtime](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464942(v=VS.85).aspx)
(or WinRT for short). In particular, I work on the WinRT metadata
infrastructure. I also work closely with our partners in Developer
Division that use the metadata to project WinRT APIs into multiple
languages.

In a nutshell, WinRT is the new API surface area for [Metro style
apps](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/) in Windows 8. WinRT
APIs are available across multiple languages – C\#, Visual Basic, C++
and JavaScript – enabling developers to build Metro style apps using the
language and frameworks they are most familiar with. Much, much more
info is available on the new [Windows Dev
Center](http://dev.windows.com).

In addition to the [developer preview docs for
WinRT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464942(v=VS.85).aspx),
there are several sessions at //build focusing on WinRT – what it is,
how it works under the covers, and how you use it from the various
languages. Here’s a handy list of all the //build sessions you should
check out if you want to know more about WinRT:

-   [Lap Around Windows
    Runtime](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/PLAT-874T)\
     Martyn Lovell – the dev manager for the Runtime Experience team –
    provides a overview of the Windows Runtime.
-   [Using the Windows Runtime from C\# and Visual
    Basic](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-531T)\
     Jesse Kaplan from the CLR team and I cover how you can build
    managed Metro style apps and how you use WinRT from C\# and VB.
    Obviously, I highly recommend this session because…Well, it’s my
    session isn’t it? What am I gonna say? Don’t watch my talk?
-   [Using the Windows Runtime from
    JavaScript](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-533T)\
     Luke Hoban from the JavaScript team talks about how WinRT is used
    when building the new Metro style apps in HTML5 and JavaScript.
-   [Using the Windows Runtime from
    C++](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-532T)\
     Herb Sutter from the C++ team as well as the C++ standards
    committee talks about how WinRT is used for C++ developers building
    native Metro style apps.
-   [Async Everywhere: creating responsive APIs and
    apps](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/PLAT-203T)\
     Ben Kuhn, a developer on the Runtime Experience team, dives deep on
    how async is exposed and implemented in WinRT
-   [Windows Runtime Internals: understanding “Hello
    World”](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/PLAT-875T)\
     Matt Merry, a teammate on the Runtime Experience PM team, goes
    under the hood and shows you how the internals of WinRT work.
-   [Being Pragmatic by leveraging existing code in Metro style
    apps](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/PLAT-877T)\
     [Jason Olson](http://twitter.com/#!/jolson88), a teammate on the
    Runtime Experience PM team and my next door office neighbor, talks
    about how you bring your existing code into the new world of Metro
    style apps. In particular, he’s got a [wicked cool
    demo](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Groove-Drum-Sequencer-cc6028ec).
-   [Windows Interns: our summer of
    apps](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/PLAT-657T)\
     John Lam, my immediate boss, is MCing this session with some of the
    Windows Interns who built the first Windows 8 Metro style apps over
    the summer.

As I write this, not all the sessions have been delivered and none of
them are available online yet. But they should all be online within a
couple of days. Also, you can also get more information as well as ask
questions over at the [Windows Dev Center
Forums](http://forums.dev.windows.com). Our dev manager has already been
[very busy answering
questions](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/martyn%20lovell%20%5Bmsft%5D/)!

I am so excited that you can finally see what we’ve been working on and
I can wait to see what <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> build with Windows 8!
