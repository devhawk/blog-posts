Halloween is the time for scary movies. Julie and I have seen two since
I got back from OOPSLA – [28 Days
Later…](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/) and [The
Grudge](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391198/). I’m not sure I would have
called 28 Days Later “Scary As Hell” but I did really like it. It had a
real plot and real characters that had real arcs. True, it also had
zombies running around, but that was much less the focus than I
expected. In fact, I think it had some thinly veiled social commentary
(that I can’t discuss w/o spoiling the movie).

On the other hand, The Grudge is simply a run-of-the-mill haunted house
story. Not that scary and no plot or characters worth mentioning. Simply
a series of loosely strung together scary scenes with little
consistency. Which was a bummer as it did have a great opening scene.
After all the comparisons to [The
Ring](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/) (which I liked, though not
as much as most people) and the fact that [Sam
Raimi](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000600/) was producing, it was very
dissappointing.

Of course, neither of these can compare to the potential horrors of
election fraud on Tuesday. Apparently, over 80 lawsuits have already
been filed (on both sides) which I don’t take as a good sign.
