Julie and I have seen two since I got back from OOPSLA &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0289043\/\">28 Days Later&#8230;<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0391198\/\">The Grudge<\/a>. I&#8217;m not sure I would have called 28 Days Later \u201cScary As Hell\u201d but I did really like it. It had a real plot and real characters that had real arcs. True, it also had zombies running around, but that was much less the focus than I expected. In fact, I think it had some thinly veiled social commentary (that I can&#8217;t discuss w\/o spoiling the movie).<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, The Grudge is simply a run-of-the-mill haunted house story. Not that scary and no plot or characters worth mentioning. Simply a series of loosely strung together scary scenes with little consistency. Which was a bummer as it did have a great opening scene. After all the comparisons to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0298130\/\">The Ring<\/a> (which I liked, though not as much as most people) and the fact that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0000600\/\">Sam Raimi<\/a> was producing, it was very dissappointing. <\/p>\n<p>Of course, neither of these can compare to the potential horrors of election fraud on Tuesday. Apparently, over 80 lawsuits have already been filed (on both sides) which I don&#8217;t take as a good sign.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Halloween is the time for scary movies.
