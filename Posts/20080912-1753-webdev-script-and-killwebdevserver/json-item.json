I wanted to add support for a -browser switch that would automatically launch a browser window the way chiron from the <a href=\"http:\/\/codeplex.com\/sdlsdk\">Silverlight Dynamic Languages SDK<\/a>. does.

That turned out to be much harder. Basically, you have to look thru all the top level windows for one that has &#8220;ASP.NET Development Server&#8221; in the window text, then you send that window two messages &#8211; WM_QUERYENDSESSION and WM_QUIT. Not sure why the WebDev server uses WM_QUERYENDSESSION to shut down it&#8217;s tray icon, but if you look at WebDev.WebServer.exe in Reflector, you&#8217;ll see the tray icon form overrides WinProc in order to look for message 0&#215;11, i.e. WM_QUERYENDSESSION.<\/p>\n<p>I threw together a quick little <a href=\"http:\/\/cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com\/self.aspx\/DevHawk%20Content\/Utilities\/KillWebDevServer.exe\">C# console app<\/a> to shutdown the WebDev server and stuck it up on my SkyDrive as well. <a href=\"http:\/\/cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com\/self.aspx\/DevHawk%20Content\/Utilities\/KillWebDevServer.zip\">Source code<\/a> is up there too. I had to use a bunch of P\/Invokes to make it work, or I would have written it in Powershell or IronPython.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I was updating my webdev powershell script today.
