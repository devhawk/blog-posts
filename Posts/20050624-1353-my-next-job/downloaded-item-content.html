<p>So after doing <a href="http://devhawk.net/Today+Is+The+Last+Day+Of+My+Life+So+Far.aspx">community</a> and <a href="http://devhawk.net/Atlas+Brand+View+Wabi+Sabi++And+DevHawk.aspx">marketing</a> for the Architecture Strategy Team in the last two years, I&#8217;m changing roles on the team again. I&#8217;m going to work for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John deVadoss</a> as a solution architect. In other words, I&#8217;m going to actually do architecture work for the Architecture Strategy Team. Go figure. <img class="grouped_elements" src=".\icon_smile.gif" rel="tc-fancybox-group610" alt=":)"> </p>
<p align="left">Seriously, I&#8217;ve actually enjoyed working for <a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/">Norman</a> and with <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/wabi-sabi/">Tanya</a>. This has been in the works for a while and I chatted about it with some of my friends who I saw at TechEd. Someone quipped that I was &#8220;getting my brain back&#8221;. Maybe I&#8217;m not getting the whole brain back, but I don&#8217;t really see it that way. Marketing is very <i>very</i><u><i><b>very</b></i></u> different from technical jobs like development and architecture but it&#8217;s just as hard. However, it does use a different part of the brain. So while I&#8217;m excited to moving into a role that plays to my strength, I&#8217;m&nbsp;walking away from my marketing experience with a new respect and understanding for the job. <a href="http://johnporcaro.typepad.com/blog/">John</a><a href="http://johnporcaro.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/reengineering_m.html">wrote about</a> SteveB talking about &#8220;selling what we build, AND building what we can sell&#8221;. I feel that spending time in marketing has made me a better equipped to build what we can sell. Frankly, I think more (all?) technologists should spend a stint in marketing so they understand what it&#8217;s all about. </p>
<p align="left">Anyway, I&#8217;m still going to be involved in community and Norman considers me a &#8220;stealth&#8221; marketing technologist (plus, he replaced me with an experienced marketing person) so I guess I&#8217;ll also do some marketing stuff. So I&#8217;ll continue to be involved with stuff like Architect MVP and TechEd ARC track, which I&#8217;ve really come to enjoy. But I&#8217;ll also be involved in projects, doing customer briefings and I&#8217;ve got a bunch of other things brewing. So it should be fun.</p>
<p align="left">However, before I make the switch I&#8217;m going on paternity leave for four weeks first. Ahh, four weeks of rest and relaxation&#8230;yeah right. We move into our new house on Monday so I&#8217;m looking at four weeks of heavy lifting, sorting stuff in boxes and changing diapers (it is paternity leave after all). I&#8217;ll try and post occasionally, but I&#8217;m going incredibly busy and have spotty network access. I&#8217;ll probably post pictures to my <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/devhawk/">MSN Space</a> on occasion since I can do that with my phone. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll see you on the other side.</p>
