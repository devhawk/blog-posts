[John](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon) was just in here admiring my
[Nomad Zen Xtra](http://www.nomadworld.com/products/Jukebox_ZenXtra/).
I’ve got nearly 500 albums loaded, over 6000 songs, and I’ve only filled
it half way. On my recent trip to Atlanta, I realized I regularly travel
with 220 GB of storage. 60GB internal laptop drive, 60GB multibay drive,
[60GB Iomega external portable USB
drive](http://www.iomega.com/na/products/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=11969855) and
the 40GB Nomad Zen. I can even get *really* obscene and make it a round
300GB, with my new [Argosy drive
enclosure](http://www.dealsonic.com/arhdal3usb20.html) (thanks to
[Peter](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/) for recommending Argosy)
and extra 80GB drive.
