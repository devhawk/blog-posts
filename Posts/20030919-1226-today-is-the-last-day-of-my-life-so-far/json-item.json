That gives you great appreciation for life-changing events that you realize are upon you. In my life, becoming a husband and becoming a father are two great examples of this. Today is another. Today is my last day as a member of Microsoft&#8217;s field organization. <\/p>\n<p>After nearly five years &#8220;in the field&#8221; with Consulting, the National Technology Team and the .NET Adoption Team, I am moving into a new position at corporate HQ with the .NET Enterprise Architecture Team (known as .NEAT). I&#8217;ll be working for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bitslag.com\/ad.htm\">Adam Denning<\/a> (who in a previous life wrote a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/tg\/detail\/-\/1572313501\/ref=pd_sim_art_elt\/102-6912101-3498524?v=glance\"> couple<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/tg\/detail\/-\/1556158246\/ref=pd_sim_art_elt\/102-6912101-3498524?v=glance\"> books<\/a> on ActiveX Controls). .NEAT is a part of the Platform Strategy group headed up by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/exec\/sanjay\/default.asp\">Sanjay Parthasarathy<\/a> which is in turn part of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/presspass\/exec\/ericr\/default.asp\">Eric Rudder&#8217;s<\/a> Servers and Tools division. I get to work with some great people, most notably Pat Helland. Among other achievements, Pat was a &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/canada\/msdn\/ecdc\/speaker.asp\">founding member<\/a>&#8221; of the MTS team and he coined the term <a href=\"http:\/\/murl.microsoft.com\/LectureDetails.asp?872\">Autonomous Computing<\/a>. Plus he&#8217;s got a <a href=\"http:\/\/zdnet.com.com\/2100-1104-942018.html\">great singing voice<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>My role on .NEAT will be to foster Microsoft&#8217;s architect community. Currently, we have the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/\">MSDN Architecture Center<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/architecture\/community\/webcasts\/default.aspx\"> Architect Webcasts<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/gotdotnet.com\/team\/architecture\/\"> Community Architecture and Design GDN Workspaces<\/a>. My goal is to expand the reach and membership of these efforts as well as improve the two-way communication channel between MSFT and the architect community. There is a lot of work to be done around architecture. When I heard <a href=\"PermaLink.aspx?guid=acb5c7d4-12a2-4e18-a0a5-fee8780c89f6\">John Zachman speak<\/a>, he stressed that we are at the very beginning of the Information Revolution. If we look to history and see the widespread effects of the Industrial Revolution, we come away with a better understanding of just how much change the Information Revolution will bring. Much more than one company can do alone <a href=\"default.aspx#disclaimer\">in my opinion<\/a>. Architecture will play a key role in the Information Revolution, so involvement in a community of architects that shares ideas and distributes influence is pretty critical for Microsoft. <\/p>\n<p>While specific community plans aren&#8217;t fully baked yet, I imagine it&#8217;s pretty obvious that blogging will be a part of them. In fact, after <a href=\"http:\/\/radio.weblogs.com\/0001011\">Scoble<\/a> I may be the second person at Microsoft to get a job in part due to my blog. One of my first duties is to get Pat blogging. Watch for that soon. Pat&#8217;s working on the next generation of the Autonomous Computing architecture vision, code named Metropolis. Get more info on that at the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/events\/pdc\/symposia.aspx\"> PDC Architecture Symposium<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to working with Pat, Adam and the other people on .NEAT, there are some other benefits of this change:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don&#8217;t have to travel so much. My wife and 7 month old son are very excited about this. When I do travel, it will be to work interesting conferences, like PDC.<\/li>\n<li>I can wear jeans every day and listen to music while I do my job. It&#8217;s pretty hard to listen to Linkin Park while presenting on SOA.<\/li>\n<li>I get my own office with windows and a door. I figured since I was the new guy on the team, I&#8217;d get a cube near the bathroom or something. Apparently, those five years of seniority count for something. However, the rumor mill has it that we&#8217;re moving soon so I don&#8217;t know how long I&#8217;ll have it. They are even recarpeting it right after I start.<\/li>\n<li>I have a lab of hardware &#8220;at my disposal&#8221;. &lt;insert evil laugh here&gt;<\/li>\n<li>Since I don&#8217;t travel so much, I should be able to make at least one of <a href=\"http:\/\/radio.weblogs.com\/0001011\/2003\/09\/17.html#a4655\">Scoble&#8217;s geek dinners<\/a> at Crossroads. I&#8217;ve been out of town for all of the ones he&#8217;s arranged so far, including this past Wednesday. Of course, if Scoble&#8217;s been planning them around my travel schedule, he&#8217;s screwed. <img src=\"http:\/\/devhawk.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group197\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" \/> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course, there are a few downsides.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I may be joining a great team, but I&#8217;m also leaving a great manager and a great team that I helped build. I will miss working with them. It&#8217;s the first team I&#8217;ve been a part of at Microsoft that handed out official team nicknames like Guns, Groove Train, Voodoo, Jet and Swahili Wild Ass. Mine was Wizard, an obvious reference to Harry Potter. <\/li>\n<li>With each job I take at MSFT, coding seems to become less a part of the job description. This is no exception.<\/li>\n<li>Since I have an office, I can only assume I&#8217;m supposed to be in it regularly. After being a technical nomad for five years, the idea of going to the same place every day is sorta weird. At least there&#8217;s free soda there.<\/li>\n<li>I have to give up my Toshiba Tablet PC. Since I don&#8217;t travel, I can&#8217;t justify two computers. So I picked <a href=\"http:\/\/h10010.www1.hp.com\/wwpc\/us\/en\/en\/WF05a\/321957-64295-89315-212727-f26-96322.html\"> power<\/a> over <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csd.toshiba.com\/cgi-bin\/tais\/pc\/pc_tabletPcDetail.jsp?comm=CS\"> style<\/a>. Maybe a Tablet PC vendor would like to give me an extended loaner? <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the short term, I may go dark on this blog since I&#8217;ve got a lot of work to do before PDC. Don&#8217;t worry. In the famous words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, I&#8217;m running for Governor of California. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Typically, we recognize big change after it happens, not before.
