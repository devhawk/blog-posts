<p>Inspired by my post on the <a href="http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e583e2ef-b99b-4500-8061-b01e550a15a6">types of architects</a>, Michael has <a href="http://www.cerkit.com/cerkitBlog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e0b5eb55-efb5-4748-9cb1-0ff8f3170fc2">blogged</a> on architect behavior: the Purist vs. the Realist. I leaned heavily to the purist side earlier in my career, but I have evolved to be more middle-of-the-road between the two. (note the use of the word "more" implying that I have not yet reached the middle-of-the-road). </p><p>Michael implied that I care about title and function more than behavior. Of course, no one has "Realist Architect" on their business card. I guess I'm wondering: if we asked this question on a survey (Are you a total purist, mostly purist, slightly purist, middle of the road, slightly realist, etc?) would anyone answer it?</p>
