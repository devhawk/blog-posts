  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Jeff, I disagree.  When teamed together, architects from each side (and the middle) work perfectly well together and can accomplish great things.  So I must say that a purist _does_ accomplish a lot.  In fact, it's the purist you want designing your API and the realist doing the code review and API usability studies.

Harry, I think my intent was to spearate the purpose of my entry from the purpose of yours by stating that it's a study of behavior rather than title and function as your entry does.  I did not mean to imply that you didn't care. :)  [removes foot from mouth]]]></wp:comment_content>
