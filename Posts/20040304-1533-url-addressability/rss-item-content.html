<p>In a meeting with <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward</a> the other day, he brought up the importance of URL addressability in the context of a project we are working on. I've run into this issue twice recently.</p><ul><li>We just posted the streaming content for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series/" name="Intro">The Architecture Strategy Series</a>Â on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/">MSDN Architecture Center</a>. While I can link directly to the sessions, there's a script on that page that pops the session up in it's own window and checks what version of Media Player you have installed. If I link directly, the window resizes wrong and you don't get video with the audio. So I end up linking to the series page instead.</li><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/seminar/teched2004/default.mspx">TechEd</a> just posted their list of <a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/breakouts.aspx">breakouts</a>, including the session I'm delivering. However, I can only link to the overall breakout page, not to my specific session. If you want to see my session, you can filter by speaker.</li></ul><p>Suffice to say, I'll be considering URL addressability from now on in anything I have a hand in developing in the future.</p>
