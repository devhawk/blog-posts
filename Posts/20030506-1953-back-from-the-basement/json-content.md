Back from vacation, caught up on email and weblogs, and ready to code.
[Scott](http://aspnetweblog.com/) sent me some of his weblog code to
look at on the plane to Phoenix. How is it that I always seem to work on
[my blog in
Phoenix](PermaLink.aspx?guid=6a7eecb5-9ba3-4322-88ac-158d821797c9)?
Looking forward to also checking out [BlogX
1.1](http://www.simplegeek.com/) or
[BlogY](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/mgudgin/default.aspx#nn2003-05-01T04:27:40Z)
or whatever they call it. Also have a few updates to the [SharePoint RSS
feed generator](prj_sharepointsynd.aspx) to implement. There’s been
interest inside Microsoft, but I haven’t heard much interest on the
outside.
