<p>I haven&#8217;t seen an &#8220;official&#8221; announcement, but Microsoft released betas of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=02ddcc80-604b-4343-9d42-4298e10a1a56"> XML for Analysis SDK</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=49737737-681e-465e-83c5-51b7223b1585"> ADOMD.NET</a>. XML for Analysis (<a href="http://www.xmla.org/">XMLA</a>) is &#8220;an open industry-standard web service interface designed specifically for online analytical processing (OLAP) and data-mining functions&#8221;. The XMLA SDK provides an XMLA compliant web service for SQL 2000 Analysis Services. ADOMD.NET provides a .NET library for accessing XMLA compliant web services. </p>
<p>I never have really gotten into Analysis Services, but I&#8217;ve wanted to. It&#8217;s always been a time issue &#8211; I just can&#8217;t focus on everything!</p>
