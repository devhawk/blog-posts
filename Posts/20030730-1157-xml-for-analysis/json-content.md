I haven’t seen an “official” announcement, but Microsoft released betas
of the [XML for Analysis
SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=02ddcc80-604b-4343-9d42-4298e10a1a56)
and
[ADOMD.NET](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=49737737-681e-465e-83c5-51b7223b1585).
XML for Analysis ([XMLA](http://www.xmla.org/)) is “an open
industry-standard web service interface designed specifically for online
analytical processing (OLAP) and data-mining functions”. The XMLA SDK
provides an XMLA compliant web service for SQL 2000 Analysis Services.
ADOMD.NET provides a .NET library for accessing XMLA compliant web
services.

I never have really gotten into Analysis Services, but I’ve wanted to.
It’s always been a time issue – I just can’t focus on everything!
