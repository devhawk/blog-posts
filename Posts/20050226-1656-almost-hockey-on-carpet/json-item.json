Apparently, many of the player&#8217;s teach for their &#8220;day jobs&#8221; which impressed <a href=\"http:\/\/techiewife.com\">my wife<\/a> immensely.

I haven&#8217;t played since I moved up due to a variety of reasons &#8211; including cost and distance to rink. But there&#8217;s an <a href=\"http:\/\/arenasports.net\/index.php?action=arena_locations\">indoor facility<\/a> where they play lacrosse in Redmond, less than four miles from campus. They also play inline hockey and indoor soccer too. <\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I watched the National Lacrosse League All-Star Game this afternoon.

Oh, and they wear minimal protective gear &#8212; helmet, some pads and gloves.  That&#8217;s it.<\/p>\n<p>In short, if you want to see a real man&#8217;s game, see lacrosse.
