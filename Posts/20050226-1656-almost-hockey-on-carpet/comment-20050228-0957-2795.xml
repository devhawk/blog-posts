  <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[With the NHL talks dead, there's been renewed interest in our local lacrosse team, the Toronto Rock (cheesy name, but a good time), with the last game I attended a couple of weeks ago drawing in over 16,000 fans to the Air Canada Centre.

I agree with all your points, and add some other observations:

1) Unlike hockey, the background rock music does not stop once the puck is in play;  it's played non-stop.

2) Unlike hockey, players are rotated on and off the pitch continuously -- it's rather amazing to watch the orchestration these guys go through.

3) Unlike hockey, the players RUN the length of the pitch several times during play, no coasting, drifting or what have you.

4) Unlike hockey, which is now becoming pansy-fied, lacrosse is full contact with slashing and checking.  Oh, and they wear minimal protective gear -- helmet, some pads and gloves.  That's it.

In short, if you want to see a real man's game, see lacrosse.  It kicks! :D]]></wp:comment_content>
