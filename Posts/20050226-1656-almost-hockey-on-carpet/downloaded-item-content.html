<p>I watched the <a href="http://nll.com/">National Lacrosse League</a> All-Star Game this afternoon. It&#8217;s not hockey, but I enjoyed it quite a bit &#8211; especially at the end. They had the league commissioner on at halftime talking about expansion. If they had a team in Seattle, I&#8217;d go. </p>
<p>One of the things I liked about Lacrosse is that the players all have to have day jobs. Average NLL salary is apparently around $12,000. Apparently, many of the player&#8217;s teach for their &#8220;day jobs&#8221; which impressed <a href="http://techiewife.com">my wife</a> immensely. She mentioned that this is how all sports leagues should be. I couldn&#8217;t agree more. </p>
<p>When I lived in LA, I used to play hockey in the amateur league. I haven&#8217;t played since I moved up due to a variety of reasons &#8211; including cost and distance to rink. But there&#8217;s an <a href="http://arenasports.net/index.php?action=arena_locations">indoor facility</a> where they play lacrosse in Redmond, less than four miles from campus. They also play inline hockey and indoor soccer too. </p>
