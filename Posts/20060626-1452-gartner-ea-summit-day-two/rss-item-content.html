<p>I didn't post a day two wrap up of the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/06/22/Gartner+EA+Summit+Day+One.aspx">Gartner EA Summit</a> because I only made it to my session and booth duty right afterwards. That wasn't the original plan - the pipes in the bathroom of my hotel room kept banging so I didn't get much sleep. </p><p>My session went well. I heard from several people afterwards that it was their favorite session or that it was the highlight of the conference. Nice anecdotal evidence, but I still want to see the scores. They recorded the session, hopefully I can get it so I can publish it here. I had lots of great conversations afterwards (as expected). Maybe Gartner will have me back next year with twelve months of my new project under my belt.</p><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/devhawk_images/img393.jpg"><img style="BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px" height="80" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/devhawk_images/img393_small.jpg" width="100" /></a> One suggestion for the Gartner folks. Next year, don't pick a logo with an arrow in it. I got a little confused when I first showed up because I followed the arrow and ended up on the wrong side of the hotel from the event. My friend Scott snapped this picture of a sign with two arrows pointing in different directions. </p>
