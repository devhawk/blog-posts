Very cool stuff. Sort of PhotoStory-esque. For someone with little kids and tons of pictures, it&#8217;s a great tool. However, I see two immediate issues that need to be rectified.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Save or Export Capability. I&#8217;ve got Max running on a clean image, but I know I&#8217;ll want to reimage it again soon when there&#8217;s a later drop of WinFX or VS or LINQ that I want to play with. However, Max doesn&#8217;t have any way to save a picture list to the hard drive. Everything (and I mean everything) is stored in an XML file in the C:Documents and Settings&lt;userName&gt;Local SettingsApplication DataMicrosoftMicrosoft Codename Max directory. Spelunking the code with Reflector, I see a locally defined namespace called System.Storage. I&#8217;m guessing this is a stub WinFS library with the intention of migrating to the real deal at some point in the future. But since it&#8217;s just a stub, there&#8217;s no simple way to get stuff in and out of that file. I tried cutting and pasting of the XML, but Max told me the store was corrupted and I had to rebuild my photo list. Please add some way to save photo lists outside of Max!\n<\/li>\n<li>No Downlevel experience. I showed my wife the photo list I built and her first response was &#8220;can you send me that?&#8221; Sadly, no I can&#8217;t. I realize that Max is supposed to be an example of the new-fangled WinFX stuff, but my wife, her best friend, my mother, my mother-in-law, etc. are NOT going to install the Sept. CTP of WinFX in order to run Max. Most of the cool Avalon stuff is in the authoring experience. Couldn&#8217;t you export a photo list to DHTML or something?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>So I had a little time to play on a recently reimaged partition so I decided to install Max to play with.
