Recently, I learned that a friend of mine from high school took his own
life. I hadn’t spoke to him in nearly a decade, but it was still a shock
and very saddening.

There’s a memorial for him this weekend in Northern Virginia, but
there’s no way I can make time to go back east for it. There will be a
large number of old friends there, many of whom I haven’t seen or spoken
to much since high school. It further adds to my sadness that it took
the death of a friend for me to both realize the need and have the
opportunity to reconnect with so many old friends.
