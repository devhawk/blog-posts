<p>Recently, I learned that a friend of mine from high school took his own life. I hadn&#8217;t spoke to him in nearly a decade, but it was still a shock and very saddening.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a memorial for him this weekend in Northern Virginia, but there&#8217;s no way I can make time to go back east for it. There will be a large number of old friends there, many of whom I haven&#8217;t seen or spoken to much since high school. It further adds to my sadness that it took the death of a friend for me to both realize the need and have the opportunity to reconnect with so many old friends.</p>
