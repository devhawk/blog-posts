<li>Quick update to the DevHawk 2007 World Tour: I won’t be making it to
the <a href="http://www.mssoaandbpconference.com/">SOA &amp; BP Conference</a>.
Riley’s having her tonsils out. As much as I’d like to hang with my
geek peeps, family is the priority. But I can still make an evening
event or geek dinner later in the week if anyone is game.</li>
<li>Caps season-opening winning streak
<a href="http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20072008/GS020036.HTM">continues</a>.
Still 100% on the PK, though the <a href="http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2007/10/early-power-outage-no-cause-for.html">power play is pretty
anemic</a>.
As I said yesterday, it’s WAAAAY to early in the season to start
bragging, but starting strong is much better than starting weak.</li>
<li>Speaking of hockey, looks like the <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117973647.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562">NHL Network is
launching</a>
in the US this month (it’s been available in Canada since 2001).
Also, <a href="http://www.nhl.tv/">NHL.tv</a> is up and running. Those wishing
to see Caps highlights can go directly to
<a href="http://Capitals.NHL.tv">Capitals.NHL.tv</a>. Unfortunately, if you
want to see full games, you’ve got to subscribe to <a href="http://www.indemand.com/sports/nhl/">Center
Ice</a> or <a href="http://www.nhl.com/nhlhq/centerice_online.html">Center Ice
Online</a> to the tune
of $150. But I don’t want to get “up to 40 games each week”, I just
want the Caps games. Between the time zone difference and kids, it’s
not like I have time to watch that much hockey anyway. Why can’t I
subscribe to just the Caps games online for say $25 a season?</li>
<li>Finished <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/halo3">Halo 3</a> Sunday night. Fun
game and a great end of the trilogy. Looking forward to what the
<a href="http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=news&amp;cid=12835">newly-independent</a>
Bungie does next. Something tells me we haven’t seen the last of
Master Chief. However, I do think
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a> has better and more
original storytelling. <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect/">Mass
Effect</a> looks like it’ll be
better still.</li>
<li>Sam Gentile <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/09/26/wcf-soa-tips-from-neudesic-dave-pallmann.aspx">pointed
out</a>
that his Neudesic colleague David Pallmann has posted a <a href="http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/?_c11_BlogPart_BlogPart=blogview&amp;_c=BlogPart&amp;partqs=cat%3dWCF">series of
WCF
tips</a>.
Several of them are right on the money like “<a href="http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!257.entry">Take Advantage of One
Way
Operations</a>”
and “<a href="http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!261.entry">Use a Discovery Mechanism to Locate
Services</a>“.
However, I can’t agree with “<a href="http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!257.entry">Maintain a Service
Catalog</a>“.
David warns that if you don’t, “The left hand won’t know what the
right hand is doing.” Of course, that’s probably the case regardless
of how you maintain your service catalog. And “<a href="http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!263.entry">Retry on minor
failures</a>“?
That’s fine, if you’ve got an
<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/idempotent">idempotent</a>
operation. Unfortunately, most non-read operations aren’t idempotent
unless you take the time to design them that way. And most people
don’t.</li>
<li>Speaking of Sam, he’s <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/10/06/goodbye-codebetter-and-alt-net.aspx">blown up his CodeBetter
blog</a>
and <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/10/07/codebetter-and-alt-net-the-short-version.aspx">walked away from the ALT.NET
crowd</a>.
I’ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/06/13/morning-coffee-89/">not been a
fan</a> of this
ALT.NET stuff since it surfaced – as Sam said, “ALT.NET is a
divisive thing” – so I’m happy to see my good friend walk away from
it.</li>
<li>Speaking of ALT.NET, Scott Hanselman blogged about <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottGuMVCPresentationAndScottHaScreencastFromALTNETConference.aspx">previewing the
new ASP.NET MVC
Framework</a>
at the ALT.NET conference. Like Sam, Scott thinks the term ALT.NET
is “too polarizing”. I like Scott’s suggestion for Pragmatic.NET.
Oh, and the MVC framework stuff looks cool too.</li>
<li>Reading <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/10/06/OAuth10IsHereDelegatedAuthorityComesToMashups.aspx">Dare’s description of
OAuth</a>
gave me a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-NET-My-Services-Specification/dp/073561556X">distinct sensation of
deja-vu</a>.</li>
</ul>
