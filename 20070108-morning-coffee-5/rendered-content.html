<p>I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord<br />
I’ve been waiting for this moment, all my life, oh Lord<br />
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord<br />

<li>It was a tough weekend in the Pierson house. For several hours on
Saturday, we thought we were going to have to put our dog D’art
down. <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!605.entry">My wife has the
details</a>,
but the good news is that he had spine trauma, but nothing broken
and he seems to be back on his way to his old self.</li>
<li>I grew up in <a href="http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=38.936518%7E-77.184293&amp;style=r&amp;lvl=13&amp;tilt=-90&amp;dir=0&amp;alt=-1000&amp;sp=Point.rybfsj4tq2g9_7332%20166th%20Ave%20NE%2c%20Redmond%2c%20WA%2098052%2c%20United%20States___">Northern
Virginia</a>,
so I’m a long time member of the Dallas Cowboy Hater’s Club. So
watching them <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270106026">snatch defeat from the jaws of
victory</a>
against my adopted Seahawks was sweet.</li>
<li>Last night, Bill Gates <a href="http://microsoftatces.com/archive/2007/01/07/2007-international-ces-keynote.aspx">kicked off
CES</a> with
the usual assortment of product news and announcements. The biggest
news, in my opinion anyway, is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/jan07/01-08IPTVXboxPR.mspx">IPTV support for Xbox
360</a>.
(Did you know MSFT has a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/tv">TV product
division</a>?) Details are fairly scarce
at this point, but I’m hoping this allows for independent
broadcasters to directly reach consumers, much like blogs have done
for independent writers. Can I use IPTV to launch my own TV channel?
Imagine the possibilities. I’d like a Washington Capitals channel,
so I can watch <a href="http://www.washingtoncaps.com/news/news.asp?story_id=4489">post game
highlights</a>
on my big screen TV rather than on my computer. A <a href="http://www.roosterteeth.com/">Rooster
Teeth</a> channel would also be nice.</li>
<li>No coding this past weekend, though I did reinstall <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/XNA/default.aspx">XNA Game Studio
Express</a> on my
recently paved dev partition. I tried playing <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/legostarwars2/">Lego Star Wars
II</a> with my son over the
weekend and he’s still having trouble learning how to use the
controller. I was thinking I might try making some simple “games” to
help him learn.</li>
