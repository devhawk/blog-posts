I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord\
I’ve been waiting for this moment, all my life, oh Lord\
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord\

-   It was a tough weekend in the Pierson house. For several hours on
    Saturday, we thought we were going to have to put our dog D’art
    down. [My wife has the
    details](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!605.entry),
    but the good news is that he had spine trauma, but nothing broken
    and he seems to be back on his way to his old self.
-   I grew up in [Northern
    Virginia](http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=38.936518~-77.184293&style=r&lvl=13&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&sp=Point.rybfsj4tq2g9_7332%20166th%20Ave%20NE%2c%20Redmond%2c%20WA%2098052%2c%20United%20States___),
    so I’m a long time member of the Dallas Cowboy Hater’s Club. So
    watching them [snatch defeat from the jaws of
    victory](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270106026)
    against my adopted Seahawks was sweet.
-   Last night, Bill Gates [kicked off
    CES](http://microsoftatces.com/archive/2007/01/07/2007-international-ces-keynote.aspx) with
    the usual assortment of product news and announcements. The biggest
    news, in my opinion anyway, is [IPTV support for Xbox
    360](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/jan07/01-08IPTVXboxPR.mspx).
    (Did you know MSFT has a [TV product
    division](http://www.microsoft.com/tv)?) Details are fairly scarce
    at this point, but I’m hoping this allows for independent
    broadcasters to directly reach consumers, much like blogs have done
    for independent writers. Can I use IPTV to launch my own TV channel?
    Imagine the possibilities. I’d like a Washington Capitals channel,
    so I can watch [post game
    highlights](http://www.washingtoncaps.com/news/news.asp?story_id=4489)
    on my big screen TV rather than on my computer. A [Rooster
    Teeth](http://www.roosterteeth.com/) channel would also be nice.
-   No coding this past weekend, though I did reinstall [XNA Game Studio
    Express](http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/XNA/default.aspx) on my
    recently paved dev partition. I tried playing [Lego Star Wars
    II](http://www.xbox.com/games/legostarwars2/) with my son over the
    weekend and he’s still having trouble learning how to use the
    controller. I was thinking I might try making some simple “games” to
    help him learn.
