I came back from the far east and got buried by email and meetings. Plus
my [stupid HP
laptop](http://devhawk.net/2003/11/12/busted-laptop-screen-busted-relationship/)
is still stupid – now the both the built in wireless and the PCMCIA card
slot are not working correctly so I can’t get on wireless. Amazing how
quickly the ability to get online from anywhere in my house has become
routine to the point where if I can’t get on wireless, I barely get
online at all.

A couple of quick takes:

-   Keith
    [blogged](http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2004/09/22/233077.aspx)
    about giving BillG the third copy of Software Factories that came
    off the presses. When he came to present Software Factories to my
    team, he gave me copy number four. He and Jack even signed it. Cool!
-   Keith and Jack’s Software Factories presentation was a huge hit with
    my team. Our architects want their own copies of the book *now*.
    [Pat](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland) even ~~stole~~ borrowed my
    signed copy to read over the weekend. I can’t wait to see the
    general response to this book.
-   I got the scores back from TechEd Malaysia and Beijing. Metropolis
    was the top architecture session of TechEd Malaysia and Data in SOA
    was the top architecture session and in the top ten of all sessions
    at TechEd Beijing. Gurpreet’s sessions also did very well. There are
    still a few [worldwide
    TechEd’s](http://www.microsoft.com/seminar/teched2004/worldwide.mspx)
    left, but I think it’s safe to say that the new architecture track
    has been a big success. We’re already in planning for next year, so
    look out for us to build on that success.
-   I’m still pretty much at the [“what good is this?”
    stage](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-09-17T07:22:15Z)
    on WS-Transfer and WS-Enumeration. I can possibly see using WS-Enum
    and/or WS-Xfer’s Get action for retrieving [reference
    data](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/dataoutsideinside.asp#dataoutsideinside_topic5),
    though recent issues with RSS and bandwidth demonstrate the
    inefficiency of polling for changes. David Ing
    [commented](http://devhawk.net/CommentView.aspx?guid=fd83ac91-720c-4053-a5ff-a3af7c547992)
    that WS-Xfer provides “semantic understanding” of actions. True, but
    at the cost of semantic understanding of the data. It’s much easier
    to change the name of the action that to change the schema of the
    message, yet WS-Xfer and WS-Enum’s operations are completely
    untyped. So I remain unconvinced of the value of these
    specifications.
