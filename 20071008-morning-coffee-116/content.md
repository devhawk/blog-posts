“Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue”\
Steve McCroskey, Airplane!

-   So it’s been a while since my last post. Just over a month, not
    including [The F5
    High](http://devhawk.net/2007/09/11/the-f5-high/), which wasn’t
    “original IP”. Frankly, I just stopped reading pretty much cold
    turkey. I wanted and needed to go heads down on day job stuff for a
    while. Since I haven’t been reading, Morning Coffee is going to be a
    little cold while I ramp back up.
-   The new NHL season is upon us, and the
    [Caps](http://capitals.nhl.com/) are looking good so far. Obviously,
    they have the new uniforms, but they’re also out to a 2-0 start for
    the first time in five years. And in those two games, they’ve only
    allowed one goal and are 100% on the PK. It’s nice to see them start
    strong, but obviously there’s a long way to go. Here’s hoping the
    can stay strong all season.
-   Speaking of staying strong, the wheels that were rattling last week
    came off the Trojan bandwagon completely this week. I’m not sure
    it’s as big an upset as [Appalachian State beating
    Michigan](http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272440130) but
    it’s close. What happened to the team that scored 5 TD’s in a row on
    Nebraska?
-   Big news last week is that MSFT is going to release the source code
    to much of the .NET Framework. Scott Guthrie [has the
    details](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx).
    Frankly, between Rotor & Reflector, it wasn’t like you couldn’t see
    the source code anyway, so this seems like a no-brainer. But
    integrating it directly into the VS Debugging experience, that’s
    frakking brilliant.
-   I haven’t had a chance to install the new [XML Schema Designer (Aug
    07
    CTP)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4de12c98-1221-4a0e-b5aa-bfc7daf02550&DisplayLang=en) 
    but I was really impressed with [this
    video](http://datajunkies.net/screencasts/XSD%20Designer%20Demo/XSD%20Designer%20Demo%20[skits].html).
    The [XML Team
    blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/xmlteam/archive/2007/08/27/announcing-ctp1-of-the-xml-schema-designer.aspx)
    has more details. However, I’m not sure what the ship vehicle is.
    The CTP install on top of VS08 beta 2, but in the video they keep
    saying “a future version” of VS, implying that it’s not going to be
    in VS08.
-   Dare is [spending some
    time](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/09/18/MessageQueuesDenormalizationAndScalability.aspx)
    investigating SSB. I think it’s interesting that some of the REST
    crowd are starting to see the need for durable messaging. Dare
    argues that the features and usage models are more important than
    wire protocol. As long as it’s standardized, I don’t care that much
    about the protocol. Several of the REST folks mentioned
    [AMQP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMQP). While I’ve got nothing
    against AMQP technically (frankly, I haven’t read the spec), but
    what does it say about durable messaging vendors (including MSFT)
    that a [financial
    institution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase_%26_Co.)
    felt the need to drive an interoperable durable messaging
    specification?
