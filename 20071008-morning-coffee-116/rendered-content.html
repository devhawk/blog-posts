<p>“Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue”<br />

<li>So it’s been a while since my last post. Just over a month, not
including <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/09/11/the-f5-high/">The F5
High</a>, which wasn’t
“original IP”. Frankly, I just stopped reading pretty much cold
turkey. I wanted and needed to go heads down on day job stuff for a
while. Since I haven’t been reading, Morning Coffee is going to be a
little cold while I ramp back up.</li>
<li>The new NHL season is upon us, and the
<a href="http://capitals.nhl.com/">Caps</a> are looking good so far. Obviously,
they have the new uniforms, but they’re also out to a 2-0 start for
the first time in five years. And in those two games, they’ve only
allowed one goal and are 100% on the PK. It’s nice to see them start
strong, but obviously there’s a long way to go. Here’s hoping the
can stay strong all season.</li>
<li>Speaking of staying strong, the wheels that were rattling last week
came off the Trojan bandwagon completely this week. I’m not sure
it’s as big an upset as <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272440130">Appalachian State beating
Michigan</a> but
it’s close. What happened to the team that scored 5 TD’s in a row on
Nebraska?</li>
<li>Big news last week is that MSFT is going to release the source code
to much of the .NET Framework. Scott Guthrie <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx">has the
details</a>.
Frankly, between Rotor &amp; Reflector, it wasn’t like you couldn’t see
the source code anyway, so this seems like a no-brainer. But
integrating it directly into the VS Debugging experience, that’s
frakking brilliant.</li>
<li>I haven’t had a chance to install the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4de12c98-1221-4a0e-b5aa-bfc7daf02550&amp;DisplayLang=en">XML Schema Designer (Aug
07
CTP)</a> 
but I was really impressed with <a href="http://datajunkies.net/screencasts/XSD%20Designer%20Demo/XSD%20Designer%20Demo%20%5Bskits%5D.html">this
video</a>.
The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xmlteam/archive/2007/08/27/announcing-ctp1-of-the-xml-schema-designer.aspx">XML Team
blog</a>
has more details. However, I’m not sure what the ship vehicle is.
The CTP install on top of VS08 beta 2, but in the video they keep
saying “a future version” of VS, implying that it’s not going to be
in VS08.</li>
<li>Dare is <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/09/18/MessageQueuesDenormalizationAndScalability.aspx">spending some
time</a>
investigating SSB. I think it’s interesting that some of the REST
crowd are starting to see the need for durable messaging. Dare
argues that the features and usage models are more important than
wire protocol. As long as it’s standardized, I don’t care that much
about the protocol. Several of the REST folks mentioned
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMQP">AMQP</a>. While I’ve got nothing
against AMQP technically (frankly, I haven’t read the spec), but
what does it say about durable messaging vendors (including MSFT)
that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase_%26_Co.">financial
institution</a>
felt the need to drive an interoperable durable messaging
specification?</li>
</ul>
