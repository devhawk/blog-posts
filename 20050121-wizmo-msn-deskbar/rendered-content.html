<p>If you’re using the <a href="http://beta.toolbar.msn.com/">MSN Deskbar</a>, you
might want to pick up <a href="http://www.grc.com">Gibson
Research’s</a> <a href="http://www.grc.com/wizmo/wizmo.htm">Wizmo</a>.
Wizmo is a command line tool that provides a grab-bag of tools.
Personally, I use it for the shutdown commands. I’ve mapped several of
them to Deskbar shortcut, particularly “shutdown” and “shutdown!”. The
exclamation point invokes the “damit” variation that overrides
applications and/or device drivers that refuse to shutdown. I know a
repave is in the near future when I’m find myself using shutdown! on a
regular basis.</p>
<p>I’m surprised Wizmo didn’t make <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/radiostories/2003/09/09/scottHanselmansUltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolsList.html">Scott’s Ultimate Power
Tools</a>
list.</p>
