After weeks of not getting around to it, I fired up my
Media-Center-in-process. I got a copy of the [Do Amazing Things
DVD](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2003/May03/05-01AmazingDVDPR.asp),
which has Hi-Def Windows Media versions of [BMW
Films](http://www.bmwfilms.com) series of short films. Mostly, I wanted
to see if my underpowered (733MHz Pentium 3) could handle the Hi-Def
feed. Short answer: it doesn’t. So do I want to buy new CPU/MB/Memory
and rebuild my system just to be able to watch [Terminator 2: Judgment
Day](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0103064) in
[Hi-Def](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/content_provider/film/HDVideo.aspx)
on my [big screen TV](http://www.toshiba.com/tacp/tv/cinema.html)? Short
answer: not yet, but soon. Given Windows Media’s focus on
[digital](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/content_provider/film/digitalcinema.aspx)
[cinema](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/content_provider/film/dmm/dailies.aspx)
[tools](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/content_provider/film/dmm/mediastore.aspx),
I imagine that T2 will be just the first of many movies available in
Hi-Def Windows Media.
