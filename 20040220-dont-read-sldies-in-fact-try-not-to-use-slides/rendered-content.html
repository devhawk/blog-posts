<p>I’m behind on my blog reading (it’s been one of those weeks) but I just
found Scott’s post of <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d017c9f3-aa3d-47bc-8d39-e6bfd8358d24">PowerPoint
Advice</a>.
He couldn’t be more right about not reading slides (and not just because
he linked to me). This is a sure sign of a presenter who doesn’t know
the material. Back when I was <a href="http://www.devhawk.net/Presentations/NET_Vision.ppt">explaining
.NET</a> to customers
3-5 times a week, I could do the presentation on a whiteboard while
hanging upside down blindfolded</p>
<p>I actually try to avoid slides when possible and just explain everything
with words and a whiteboard. The nice thing about this approach is that
I can be flexible when the audience needs me to be. Today, I presented
to a group of architects from an ISV on Metropolis and SOA. I had slides
at the ready, but I spent most of the time just talking with the
audience, not to them. When I finally did go to the slides, I found I
had covered the vast majority of the information I wanted to explain and
the slides were more of a hiderance than a help. I shut down the
projector a few minutes later and went back to just talking.</p>
<p>Granted, for larger audiences (like
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?LinkID=404299">TechEd</a>), you need to use
slides, but they should be a fall-back position when needed, not the
first tool out of the toolbox. If you <em>have</em> to do slides, please follow
