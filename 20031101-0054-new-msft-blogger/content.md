My ex-teammate Jeromy Carriere has [started a
blog](http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/jeromyc/). Or should I say he
started a blog months ago but only recently started writing anything but
test posts. He was part of a panel @ OOPSLA (which was happening
concurrently with PDC) on app servers, which he [describes in
detail](http://dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/jeromyc/posts/3031.aspx).

So that makes one [current teammate](http://radio.weblogs.com/0125998/)
and two ex-teammates who are blogging. (The other ex-teammate is [Rick
Culpepper](http://rickculpepper.net/), who left MSFT in search of less
traveled pastures.) I think that number needs to go up.
