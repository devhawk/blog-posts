Added two new .NET links: [Patterns &
Practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/) and [NUnit
Addin](http://www.mutantdesign.co.uk/nunit-addin/). Patterns & Practices
slogan is “proven practices for predictable results”. They include
documentation on [Reference
Architectures](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/type/Architectures/default.asp),
[Operational
Practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/type/Operationalpractices/default.asp),
and [Building
Blocks](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/type/Blocks/default.asp).
While there are some
[great](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/distapp.asp)[ones](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnnetsec/html/secnetlpMSDN.asp)[up](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/DBGrm.asp)[there](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/DALGRoadmap.asp)[already](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/tdlg_rm.asp),
look for more in April to coincide with the [VS.NET
2003](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/vstudio03/default.asp)
release. NUnit Addin integrates the popular
[NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/) .NET port of the xUnit testing framework
directly into VS.NET for “point and test” capability. I’ve already given
[Jamie](http://dotnetweblogs.com/NUnitAddin) my \#1 enhancement request
– automatic test execution on every build. I’ve also had a look at the
[code](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nunitaddin/) and I would highly
recommend any add-in developer take a look. Jamie’s add-in framework is
very impressive. I hacked in a sample implementation of auto test
execution very quickly because his code is so nicely factored.
