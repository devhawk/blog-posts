<p>You probably don’t know me. I work in your company….We work hard. the
situation is bad. We work harder, yet you can’t even bring yourself to
say “good morning” to us, who have worked for you for several years
now. some of us gave up better paying offers because of false promises
you have made. We worked like dogs for nights on end in more then one
occasio. never once did you decide to stop and say “good job” or “Keep
going. you just go on, with your sealed face and you astronomical
salary, leaving us behind, trying to wonder what the hell is going yo
happen next….We are tired. Tired of this abuse. We won’t stand for
this much longer. You must understand that people are your most
precious asset, and their loyalty is what will help you stay alive. Do
you know what is the first thing to happen once the market situation
calms down and things will be a litlle bit more normal? You will be
left with an empty company. [<a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/Rosherove/posts/4176.aspx">Roy Osherove’s

that</a>, got fed up, quit and went to work for
Microsoft. No company I’ve ever worked for understands that “our people
is our most precious asset” better than Microsoft.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers">Microsoft Careers</a>
site, there are 1729 positions open across the US right now. Why wait?</p>
