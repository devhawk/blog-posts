As he

on his blog, [Pat Helland’s](http://pathelland.com/) last day at
Microsoft is tomorrow. He’s busily cleaning out his office right now.
:frowning: He’s
starts on Monday @ Amazon to help them implement a service oriented
architecture. I heard their
[CTO](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000534.html)
was
[hiring](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu:9000/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=538). 
Pat’s a big reason why I came to work for Architecture Strategy so I’m
really sorry to see him go.

On the plus side, no one will quip “it’s been nice hanging out with you”
in the men’s room anymore.

Seriously, Pat’s been through some seriously hard times this past twelve
months, and I think the change is a great opportunity for him. I imagine
I’ll see him often enough – he’s back on campus next week to present at
an architecture forum. Plus, I offered to setup dasBlog on
pathelland.com so he’ll keep blogging.
