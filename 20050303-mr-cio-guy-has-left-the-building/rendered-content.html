<p>As he
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2005/03/03/384636.aspx">wrote</a>
on his blog, <a href="http://pathelland.com/">Pat Helland’s</a> last day at
Microsoft is tomorrow. He’s busily cleaning out his office right now.
😦 He’s
starts on Monday @ Amazon to help them implement a service oriented
architecture. I heard their

was
<a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu:9000/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=538">hiring</a>. 
Pat’s a big reason why I came to work for Architecture Strategy so I’m
really sorry to see him go.</p>
<p>On the plus side, no one will quip “it’s been nice hanging out with you”
in the men’s room anymore.</p>
<p>Seriously, Pat’s been through some seriously hard times this past twelve
months, and I think the change is a great opportunity for him. I imagine
I’ll see him often enough – he’s back on campus next week to present at
an architecture forum. Plus, I offered to setup dasBlog on
pathelland.com so he’ll keep blogging.</p>
