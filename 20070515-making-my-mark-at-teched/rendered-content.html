<p>One of the things that’s different about being in MSIT is that it’s cut my
travel dramatically. Basically, the only travel I’ve done since taking
this job was <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/09/27/thoughts-on-the-soa-workshop/">Thomas Erl’s SOA
Workshop</a>
last September. So it came as a bit of a surprise when I got tapped to
present at TechEd (at fairly close to the last minute).</p>
<p>The last year I ran the <a href="https://www.msteched.com/public/tracks.aspx#ARC">architecture
track</a>, all track
owners were asked to include either a globalization or MSIT session in
our track. Since then, MSIT has expanded it’s role at TechEd
dramatically, with 14 breakouts, 20 chalk talks and our own Technical
Learning Center.</p>
<p>I’m doing a two chalk talks on my MSIT project, Rome. I
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/06/15/moving-on/">mentioned</a> the project
back when I switched jobs, but we’ve never talked about the project by
name before. We haven’t accomplished quite as much as I’d hoped since
then, but we’ve progressed to the point that we can talk publicly about
what we’re doing. Now that we’ve begun to open the kimono a bit, you
should see more on Rome, Not only from me but also my teammates who
blog: <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/">Dale</a>,
<a href="http://rickbarn.spaces.live.com/">Rick</a> and
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dotties/">Dottie</a>.</p>
<p>So if you’re going to TechEd, make sure you stop by the MSIT Technical
Learning Center and say hi. Unlike my last two trips to TechEd, I have
very limited responsibilities this time – basically just show up on time
and talk about what I do all day, twice – so that leaves plenty of time
to attend sessions, chat up attendees and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2007/attendeeparty.mspx">ride roller
coasters</a>.
Hope to see you there.</p>

<p><strong>ROME: Service Oriented Infrastructure for the Enterprise</strong><br />
Like most enterprises, Microsoft IT is adopting a service oriented
approach for the development of their internal systems. However, in
order to avoid projects building similar service infrastructures on a
per application basis, MSIT realizes the need for a common service
oriented infrastructure to build these systems upon. Inside MSIT, the
Rome project is tasked with designing, building and maintaining the
infrastructure for these services. Come chat with Harry Pierson, lead
architect of the Rome project, and discuss the challenges of building
a large-scale service infrastructure inside a large enterprise like
Microsoft.</p>
