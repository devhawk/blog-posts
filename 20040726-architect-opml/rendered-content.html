<p>I finally updated my Architecture Strategy and Evangelist Blogs <a href="http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx">OPML
file</a>. For single updates, DasBlog’s
web interface is fine, but for doing a slew of updates it blows. I guess
that’s why my blogrolls are so out of date. What I really want is an
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Office/infopath">InfoPath</a> form so I can do
all the updates locally and then upload the new file at once. InfoPath’s
integration with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint">SharePoint</a>
rocks, I wonder what it would take to get that kind of integration on an
arbitrary web site? Or, alternatively, how to run your blog on
SharePoint? I screwed around with SharePoint as a “personal content
management system” a while back, but the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/09/10/tool-vs-product/">difficulty in customizing
it</a>
(as well as a lack of time on my part) doomed that.</p>
