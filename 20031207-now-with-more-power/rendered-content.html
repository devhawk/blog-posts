<p>If you’re reading this, you’ve found the new-and-improved DevHawk. I’ve
changed both web hosts and blogging programs to deliver an improved
blogging experience for all. Well, at least an improved blogging
experience for me. You, you’re on your own.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://64.94.229.113/PermaLink.aspx?guid=344c6c7e-233f-4367-8787-9eea4c578ce8">wrote two months
ago</a>
that I was planning a switch to dasBlog. I <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4fdf3142-1e5e-473f-a40a-5ff740e01a95">helped
out</a>
with a few features (so far just CDF support and comment deletion, but
I’m working on story support). Actually, it’s kinda cool how <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=818eef33-e8e8-41c5-b58b-6e910e283ac0">dasBlog
v1.5
shipped</a>
as I was moving servers. I did have to hold of on blogging for a couple
of weeks, but in the end, I think it will be worth it. Now I get all the
cool stuff I was too lazy to add to my own blog engine like comments,
search and a web-based admin interface.</p>
<p>I am running a slightly non-standard version of dasBlog. If you read my
site (as opposed to my RSS feed), you’ll see I have a little comment
that I call a tagline associated with each entry. I got the idea from
<a href="http://technovangelist.com/">Matt Williams</a>, who uses to record where
he was when he made that entry. I got bored with just putting my
location in there, so I started making snippy comments instead. I
submitted the Tagline code to dasBlog, but
<a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/">Clemens</a> rejected it on the
grounds that it pretty much a Harry-only feature.</p>
<p>Since I haven’t got story support figured out, I’m just using static
files for my <a href="http://64.94.229.113/articles.aspx">articles</a>,
<a href="http://64.94.229.113/projects.aspx">projects</a> and
<a href="http://64.94.229.113/presentations.aspx">presentations</a>. DasBlog has a
feature called FormatPage for rendering static content inline with the
weblog template. Combined with the built-in URL rewriting engine, I was
able to create simple URLs for my static content. Unfortunately, I still
had to break all my old urls. And I’ll (probably) break them again when
I get story support figured out.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that my new site is live, we can return to normal
programming.</p>
