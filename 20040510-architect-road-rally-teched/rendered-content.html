<p>Among my other duties, I am co-ower of the <a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/tracks.aspx#a7c12aff-c193-4de3-977c-a8623c7acbe3">architecture
track</a>
at this year’s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/teched">TechEd</a>. We’ve got a
great track lined up, including two new sessions from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland">Pat
Helland</a> in his Metropolis series. You
can see an earlier version of the original Metropolis session as part of
the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series/">Architecture Strategy
Series</a> or read
an
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj2metrop.asp">article</a>
about Metropolis in the latest
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal">JOURNAL</a>. I’m
presenting a session on information architecture (guess I gotta get the
slides done soon!). Plus there are 15 other great sessions to see on
architecture. We’re also running two precon’s on architecture : One on
<em><a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/precons.aspx#PRC003">patterns and
practices</a></em> (run by
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kpleas/">Keith Pleas</a>, my recent
partner-in-crime on <a href="http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=61">.NET
Rocks</a>)
and one on <a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/precons.aspx#PRC012">identity
management</a>.</p>
<p>After the precons on Sunday night, we’re having a party – the <a href="http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp">Architect
Road Rally</a> @ the
<a href="http://www.sdautomuseum.org/">San Diego Auto Museum</a>. Party goers get a
close up look at the <a href="http://www.sdautomuseum.org/exhibit.html">history of
Porshe</a>, race RC cars and play
the new <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/rallisportchallenge2">Rallisport Challenge
2</a> on Xbox. We’re also
giving away some RC cars as well as copies of RSC2. Plus, food &amp; beer
all evening (i.e. this is not an hor’dourves party). So please
<a href="http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp">register</a> and come
have a good time.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re also planning on running focus groups @ TechEd – your
chance to help us help you better with architecture. Also, people chosen
to participate in the focus groups get something Cool.
<a href="http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp">Register</a> for the
focus groups when you register for the road rally.</p>
<p>See you in San Diego!</p>
