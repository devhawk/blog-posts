    "content": "What is integration at all?\n\nApplication Integration is – ironically – about application division. I recently posted my view on how applications can be divided into separated components and how the components are glued together. Several “glue-areas” are recognized where mashups, portals, shared databases, SOA and EDA all play a role in gluing the pieces together.\n\nhttp://soa-eda.blogspot.com/2007/08/what-is-eai.html\n\nI agree not to sell integration to the business, but just do it. \n\n\nJack",
