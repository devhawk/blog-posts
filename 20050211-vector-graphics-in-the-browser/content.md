I guess there’s no real good story for vector graphics in the browser. I
know IE supports VML natively, but no other browser does. SVG is the
standard, but you need a plugin to make that work in IE and FireFox.
Adobe makes an SVG plugin, but who has that installed? Everyone has
Flash installed, but that seems like overkill to render a few vector
graphics. Avalon would be perfect, except that it isn’t shipping yet.

Does that mean that if I want to build a wide reach website that creates
relatively simple data driven graphics (bsaically filled boxes) that I
still have to use images?
