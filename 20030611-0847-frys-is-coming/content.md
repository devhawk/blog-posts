I’m not the
[first](http://technovangelist.com/blogs/default.aspx?date=06/11/03) to
[report](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/06/11.html#a3311) this,
but [Fry’s is coming to Renton in
mid-July](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134930115_frys07.html)
(30 minutes from MSFT Campus). That’s Fry’s Electronics, not [Fry’s Food
& Drug](http://devhawk.net/2003/06/03/driving-tour-of-phoenix/).
:smile:
Scoble called it the “most important news of the day”. Matt calls it
“Heaven”. +1

I moved up from Los Angeles to Seattle about 2 years ago and was shocked
there wasn’t a Fry’s anywhere nearby. (I didn’t know about the one
[Matt](http://technovangelist.com/) mentioned in Oregon). Glad to see
this oversight is going to be rectified by next month.
