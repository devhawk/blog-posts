<p>I just signed up for the <a href="http://www.pressplay.com">PressPlay</a> free
trial. I’m on the road and just needed some tunes. I guess I should also
try some of the other the services, but so far I’m very impressed. Only
a couple of annoyances: the whole “<a href="http://www.pressplay.com/faq.html#general_05">Portable
Download</a>” concept is way
more complicated &amp; pricey than it needs to be. Everyone else just
charges 99¢ a song (or less). What’s with the buying “packs” of portable
downloads? And, of course, their music collection could be bigger – no
AC/DC 😦. But lots of stuff that I haven’t listened to since I was a DJ
for my <a href="http://www.kscrradio.com/">college radio station</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of college radio, writing this post inspired me to google my
old radio station KSCR. I guess it never occurred to me before now, but
of course they are streaming over the Internet. Currently playing:
<a href="http://entertainment.msn.com/album/?song=1194111&amp;album=117846">World’s On
Heroin</a>
by <a href="http://entertainment.msn.com/artist/?artist=112951">All</a>. Never
heard it before, but I like it. Current show on KSCR is <em>Yay For
Punk</em> with Naitze “DJ Naitze
Naitz” Teng &amp; Kate Wilcox. Their on-air sound needs work and apparently
the issues of DJ’s arriving on time still hasn’t been solved.</p>
