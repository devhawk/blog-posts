<p>Like many in the Microsoft dev community, I’m a heavy user of <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com">Visual
Studio</a> and
<a href="http://microsoft.com/powershell">Powershell</a>. And so, of course, I’ve
been a heavy user <a href="http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/post/The-last-vsvars32ps1-Ill-ever-need.aspx">Chris Tavares’ vsvars32.ps1
script</a>.
However, recently I needed the ability to specify my desired processor
architecture when setting up a VS command line session. Unfortunately,
Chris’s script wraps vsvars32.bat which only supports generating 32-bit
apps. Luckily, VC++ includes a vcvarsall.bat script that let’s you
specify processor architecture. So I updated my local copy of
<a href="http://1drv.ms/1kf8g9I">vsvars.ps1 </a> to use vcvarsall.bat under the hood
and added an -x64 switch to enable setting up a 64-bit command line
environment. Vcvarsall.bat supports a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x4d2c09s.aspx">variety of additional
options</a>, but
64-bit support is all I needed so that’s all I added. I didn’t change
the name of the script because there’s WAY too much muscle memory
associated with typing “vsvars” to bother changing that now.</p>
<p>If you want it, you can get my architecture aware version of vsvars.ps1
from my OneDrive here: <a href="http://1drv.ms/1kf8g9I">http://1drv.ms/1kf8g9I</a>.</p>
