<p>I was reading <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/">Steve’s</a> blog with my
browser earlier today when I noticed his odd permalink url’s. Instead of
a url like
“http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=9abbd5ea-3a10-44d8-8872-877033b7349c”,
his look like
“http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,fc99ce5e-b748-44f0-853d-0a261632b885.aspx”.
Turns out it’s a standard feature of dasBlog! Just check “Enable URL
rewriting” in the config page and you’re set. Now my permalink url’s
look like Steve’s.</p>
<p>Since Google doesn’t index pages based on query string, this feature
should make my site more easily crawled and googled.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: This feature breaks sub category specific feeds, like “<a href="CategoryView.aspx?category=Blogging%7CdasBlog">Blogging
| dasBlog</a>“, so I’m
turning it back off until someone can fix the bug.</p>
