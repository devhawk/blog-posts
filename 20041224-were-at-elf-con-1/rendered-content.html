<p>NORAD has been tracking Santa on Christmas Eve for 50 years. My
mother-in-law remembers listening to it on the radio. Now, they have a
<a href="http://www.noradsanta.org/">website</a>. Apparently, Santa and I visited a
few of the same places this year. Here’s <a href="http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/1200.jpg">Santa at Sky
City</a> in Auckland, New
Zealand. Here he is at the <a href="http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/1400.jpg">Sydney Opera
House</a> in Australia. And
<a href="http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/1600.jpg">here he is</a> at the Great
Wall of China. According to NORAD, Santa hasn’t hit Seattle yet – last
report was at 10pm pacific time and Santa was in Colorado. But I’m sure
he’s on his way.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: about 15 minues after I posted this originally, Santa was
<a href="http://www.noradsanta.org/santacam/0700.jpg">spotted in Seattle</a>. I
thought I heard something downstairs.</p>
