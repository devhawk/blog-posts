<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon">John Evdemon</a> and I were chatting about
making time to “get our hands dirty” on some code. After the last
meeting between hockey owners and players, it looks like we’ll both have
plenty of time on our hands since there won’t be any hockey to watch.</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=hradek_ej&amp;id=1878413">this ESPN.com
article</a>
that there is plenty of blame to go around, but it looks to me that most
of it sits with the players on this one. The players 12th-hour proposal
apparently included a luxury tax/revenue sharing system and a salary
rollback that would come to about $100 million dollars. The problem is
the league as a whole is losing around $200-$300 million a year
(<a href="http://www.nhlcbanews.com/levitt/index.html">according to</a> former SEC
Commission Chair Arthur Levitt). So great, with the player’s proposal,
the league continues to hemorrhage over $100 million a year while the
luxury tax system spreads it around so everyone feels the pain.</p>
<p>Maybe these guys have been checked into the boards a few too many times,
but the numbers are very simple: According to <a href="http://www.nhlcbanews.com/levitt_transcript021204.html">the
league</a>, their
revenue is around $2 billion, with around 75% going to player salaries.
Furthermore, in the past decade, revenue has grown 173% but player
salaries have grown 261%. Mess around with those numbers in Excel and
you’ll discover that revenue is growing about 5.6% year while salaries
are growing 10% a year. Assuming those numbers stay constant and you
have salaries equaling revenue in 2011 – only 7 years away. Now, if you
include the 5% salary rollback that the players are proposing, assuming
the model doesn’t change much (and it shouldn’t – my understanding of
the rest of the player proposal deals with revenue sharing, but I’m
using the overall league revenue and salaries in this analysis) then
that date pushes back just one entire season before the player salaries
equal revenue. I’m not sure how anyone in the player’s union can say the
current system is working with a straight face.</p>
<p>It’s going to be a long cold winter if you’re a hockey fan. I’m guessing
the players are assuming they owners will cave like they did during the
’94-’95 season. Memo to the players, in 1994, the owners were only
paying about half of league revenues to player salaries. In other words,
they made more money playing than not playing. This time, with the
owners losing less money by not playing, they don’t have much incentive
to cave.</p>
