FYI, I haven’t been accessing my [DevHawk email
address](mailto:harry@devhawk.net) for a while.
Basically, I never got back in the rhythm of checking that address after
the site came back up in early May. Excuses abound – I was way to busy
with TechEd, work, family, I get more than enough email at my [work
address](mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com), blah blah blah.
Anyway, I’ve finally got around to checking that email. Besides the ton
of spam, there was also a bunch of real email from people asking
questions. If you sent me email in the past two months, sorry I’ve
ignored you. I’ll stop ignoring and respond shortly!
