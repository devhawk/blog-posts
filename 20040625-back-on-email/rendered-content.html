<p>FYI, I havenâ€™t been accessing my <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net">DevHawk email
address</a> for a while.
Basically, I never got back in the rhythm of checking that address after
the site came back up in early May. Excuses abound â€“ I was way to busy
with TechEd, work, family, I get more than enough email at my <a href="mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com">work
address</a>, blah blah blah.
Anyway, Iâ€™ve finally got around to checking that email. Besides the ton
of spam, there was also a bunch of real email from people asking
questions. If you sent me email in the past two months, sorry Iâ€™ve
ignored you. Iâ€™ll stop ignoring and respond shortly!
