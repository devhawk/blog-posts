<p>Is there a decent (note, my standards are low) command line text file
search &amp; replace utility around? Everything I’ve found is a perl script,
requires Ruby or costs money. Not that I can’t afford $25 for a usable
utility, but I don’t think $3 / line of code is worth it. I built an
ultra-simplistic .NET utility that was 8 lines of code (not including
error handling, usage guide and license) that just takes a single file
name, search regular expression and replacement text and uses the built
in regular expression object to do the replacement.</p>
<p>I expect that someone will point out something ultra-obvious to me, and
I’ll send my ultra-simplistic code to the recycle bin. If not, I’ll post
the 8 lines of code (plus the error handling, usage guide and license).</p>
