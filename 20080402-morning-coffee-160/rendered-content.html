<p>I took most of last week between jobs and have spent much of this week
getting machines setup, access to builds, etc. Furthermore, RSS Bandit
ate my feedlist and I am still soldiering on sans mobile phone so I was
pretty much unconnected for about a week and a half.</p>
<h4>IPy Stuff</h4>
<ul>
<li>Laurence Moroney
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/webnext/archive/2008/03/30/silverlight-dynamic-languages-in-visual-studio.aspx">demonstrates</a>
how to configure a web site project in VS08 to use <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/">Dynamic
Silverlight’s</a> development web
server Chiron. I looked at turned it into an exported template, but
I think the Start Options are stored in the suo file and I’m not
sure how to include that in the template. Maybe it could be set w/ a
macro or at worst a GAX recipe?</li>
<li>If you’re a regular reader, you might as well get used to the name
“Michael Foord”. He’s a developer @ <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/">Resolver
Systems</a>, makers of the IPy based
<a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/products/resolver-one.php">Resolver
One</a>
app/spreadsheet hybrid I’ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/01/31/morning-coffee-141-lang-net-08-edition/">written about
before</a>.
He’s also the author of the upcoming <a href="http://www.ironpythoninaction.com/">IronPython in
Action</a> book and the maintainer
of <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/planet/">Planet
IronPython</a> and the
<a href="http://www.ironpython.info/">IronPython Cookbook</a>. I’m going to try
very hard to only link to Michael at most once per day. Frankly,
that’ll be tough.</li>
<li>Today’s Michael Foord Link: Michael turned his PyCon talk on IPy +
SL2 into a series of articles entitled <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2008_03_22.shtml#e949">IronPython &amp; Silverlight 2
Tutorial with Demos and
Downloads</a>.</li>
<li>Ken Levy (who now sits just down the hall from me) <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vsxteam/archive/2008/03/31/ironpython-studio-1-0-for-isolated-and-integrated-vs-shell.aspx">clued
me</a>
into the 1.0 release of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPythonStudio">IronPython
Studio</a>, which is a free
IDE based on the VS08 Shell for IronPython (based on code from the
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/vsx/">VS SDK</a>). Big new feature in this
release is support for the integrated VS08 Shell, which means it’ll
snap into your existing VS08 installation (well, not express) rather
than forcing you to install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=ACA38719-F449-4937-9BAC-45A9F8A73822&amp;displaylang=en">300 MB isolated
shell</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Stuff</p>
<ul>
<li>Caps had a <a href="http://www2.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&amp;page=Recap&amp;gameNumber=1189&amp;season=20072008&amp;gameType=2">BIG win last
night</a>
when they needed it most. Now they’re tied with Carolina for the SE
division lead, but they lose the tiebreaker so unfortunately, they
can’t make the playoffs without help. ‘Canes have to head back home
last night to play Tampa Bay, they have to win tonight and Friday to
clinch. Loss in either gives the Caps control of their own destiny.
Caps are only one game back of Ottawa, Boston and Philly, none of
whom have played well down the stretch. It does mean I have to root
for the frakking Penguins to beat Philly, twice.</li>
<li>Now that I’m in a job where I’ll be traveling occasionally, I really
appreciated Scott Hanselman’s <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/10GuerillaAirlineTravelTipsForTheGeekMindedPerson.aspx">travel
tips</a>,
though I’m not sure “Don’t look like a schlub” is in the cards for
me.</li>
<li>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’re probably aware that
Scott Guthrie
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/03/21/asp-net-mvc-source-code-now-available.aspx">blogged</a>
that the ASP.NET MVC Source Code is <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet">available on
CodePlex</a>. The project name is
“aspnet” not “aspnetmvc” which makes me wonder if they might release
the source to more ASP.NET stuff over time.</li>
<li>Speaking of Scott Guthrie, today he blogged about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/04/02/unit-testing-with-silverlight.aspx">unit testing in
Silverlight</a>.
Jeff Wilcox appears to have the <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/03/31/silverlight2-unit-testing/">definitive
post</a>
on the subject, including links to the SilverLight testing framework
(it’s included in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=EA93DD89-3AF2-4ACB-9CF4-BFE01B3F02D4&amp;displaylang=en">SL Controls source code
release</a>).
He also provides a prebuilt “Silverlight Test” project template for
easy download. Personally, I really like the in-browser test runner.
I wonder how hard it would be to hook that up to
<a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/">DySL</a> so you could write your tests
in IPy? (given that IPy doesn’t have attributes, I’m guessing
there’d be at least a bit of work involved in making this happen)</li>
<li>Speaking of Silverlight,
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/apr08/04-01WM61PR.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases">apparently</a>
the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/6-1/default.mspx">next version of Windows
Mobile</a>
(i.e. 6.1) will support it. Since I’m in the market for a new phone
anyway, I’m thinking of getting one of these. Also, it’s nice to see
a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/6-1/default.mspx">marketing site for WM
6.1</a> using
Silverlight instead of Flash like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/6/default.mspx?WT.mc_ID=wmhome_WM6">WM 6.0 marketing
site</a>
does.(via

<li>Ted Neward turns the news that MSFT is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=3356AF19-A36E-4D6D-9D13-C37DB81EE607&amp;displaylang=en">releasing XAML under the
OSP</a>
into a <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/04/02/Is+Microsoft+Serious.aspx">long and fascinating history
lesson</a>
that is well worth the read. I’m going to skip commenting on it,
beyond advising you dear reader to read this if you haven’t already,
except to wonder: how many sides does a “Redmondagon” have?</li>
