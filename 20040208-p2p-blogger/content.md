Noah Horton, former teammate who has gone on to become PM in the Peer
Networking Group, has started a [blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/noahh/). Of
course, with the new [aggregated feed](http://blogs.msdn.com) of MSDN
bloggers, you probably already knew that. However, I am compelled to
blog this as Noah is a friend, works in the next building over from me
and I’ve got a special [interest in
P2P](http://devhawk.net/CategoryView.aspx?category=Development%7CP2P).
I’m looking forward to his [promised tips and
tricks](http://blogs.msdn.com/noahh/archive/2004/02/05/68256.aspx).
