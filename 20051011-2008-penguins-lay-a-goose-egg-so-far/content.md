It warms my heart that
[Toronto](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=251011021) and [St.
Louis](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=251011019) both won
tonight. That means the only team without a win in the NHL at the end of
the first week is the
[Penguins](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/clubhouse?team=pit). I can hear
[John](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/) groaning as I type. And
Pittsburg doesnâ€™t play again until Saturday, so I can [run
smack](http://www.jimrome.com/home/jungle/smacktionary.html) at him all
week.
