<p>Late start + early meeting = short post today</p>
<ul>
<li>Want a free SAAB? Drop a line to <a href="http://rickbarn.spaces.live.com/">my
boss</a>. Note, you have to be
willing to steal it.</li>
<li>Saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424345/">Clerks II</a> last night. It
was the first Kevin Smith movie I haven’t seen in the theaters since
the original. Better than I expected, but it’s time for Kevin to
move on to new material.</li>
<li>Unlike most avid movie fans I know, I’m not a NetFlix customer.
Nothing against them, but I’ve never been moved to sign up. But we
did just sign up for the free trial of <a href="https://www.blockbuster.com/totalaccess">Blockbuster Total
Access</a>. Basically, it’s a
clone of NetFlix, but you can bring your movies back to your local
Blockbuster store and get a free rental on the spot. Plus, you get
eCoupons (I think once a month) which are good for free movie or DVD
rentals in the store. We’ll see how it goes.</li>
<li>As expected, I didn’t get much done yesterday. I don’t think anyone
did around here. I did pave the dev partition on my laptop. My
laptop isn’t very Vista friendly and we blew our hardware budget on
new desktops (which I am definitely not complaining about) so I’m
still on XP.</li>
<li>I wonder how well <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/compact/default.mspx">SQL <del>MobileAnywhere</del> Compact
Edition</a> works
with ASP.NET? Seems like that would be a better choice than SQL
Express for small websites like personal blogs.</li>
<li>Almost finished getting Christmas put away. What with the wind
storm, it seems like it went by very fast this year.</li>
</ul>
