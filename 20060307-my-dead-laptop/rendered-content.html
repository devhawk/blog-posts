<p>So between this mornings <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/9091" title="multi-touch interface demo">multi-touch interface
demo</a>
and the session on <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8267" title="Amazon's Mechanical Turk service">Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
service</a>,
my laptop died. At least, the display did. Sometimes I can get it to
work for a short time by closing and re-opening the lid. But in the
constant jostling environment of a confernce audience, getting it to
keep working has proved impossible.</p>
<p>Of course this couldn’t happen while I’m at home with convienent access
to the help desk. I’m at the Emerging Tech conferences for pete sake!</p>
<p>I would have just bought a laptop at CompUSA or something, but that
qualifies as a captial expenditure and my boss wouldn’t sign off on it
(primarily because of the paperwork he’d have to fill out). Luckily,
<a href="http://www.computerrentals.com/" title="CRE Rentals">CRE Rentals</a> was able to
get a machine over to me in a few hours so I’m back online. I guess I
won’t be doing any more coding this trip, but I guess I’ll survive.</p>
<p>More from ETech later. In the meantime, check out Ray Ozzie’s blog entry
on <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry">Wiring the
Web</a>.
I may be biased, but it’s the coolest new thing I’ve seen here so far
(though the multi-touch interface is pretty awesome too)</p>
