<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland">Pat</a> did at
<a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2004/sf/keynotes.asp">keynote</a>
at <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2004/sf/">VSLive San
Fransicso</a>. He
talked about Metropolis (of course). Good to see architectural content
making it’s way into mainstream developer events. It even got picked up
by
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/03/25/HNhelland_1.html">InfoWorld</a>.
I’m not sure how architect == “Microsoft exec”, but it’s great coverage
none the less.</p>
<p>Pat will be speaking at
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/seminar/teched2004/default.mspx">TechEd</a> in
May. In addition to his Metropolis overview, he has two session drilling
further into the parallels between applications and buildings as well as
between manufactured goods and structured data.</p>
<p>You can see a slightly older version of Pat’s Metropolis overview on
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/enterprise/default.aspx">Architecture
Center</a>.
Downloadable versions are coming soon.</p>
