I finally got my mailbox over to my new office building. One of the
things that had collected dust before the switch: a retractable modem
cable with a Microsoft product logo on it. I assume they sent it to
people in the field to raise awareness of their product. But a modem
cable? In the past year, I can count the number of times I’ve used my
laptop’s modem on one hand. Besides, I have a dozen of these stupid
things.

Our group has GREAT giveaways. At an event last year, we gave away [USB
phone chargers](http://www.keyspan.com/products/cables/K-ZIP-CELL-ER/).
They’re more common now, but I had never seen one before at the time.
We’ve also given away [USB
lamps](http://www.officewisdom.com.au/InnovProd/FireFlyLamp.htm) and
[portable USB
webcams](http://www.digitallyunique.net/digitally-unique/ceusca12.html).
