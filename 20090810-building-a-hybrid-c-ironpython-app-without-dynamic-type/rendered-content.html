<p>Arguably, the biggest feature of C# 4.0 is the new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264736(VS.100).aspx">dynamic
type</a>.
And it’ll be great…when it ships. In the meantime, some of us what to
build hybrid C# and IronPython applications today, such as my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/08/07/pygments-for-windows-live-writer-v1-0-2/">Pygments
for Windows Live Writer
plugin</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> is a syntax highlighter, written in
Python, with support for <a href="http://pygments.org/languages/">over one hundred
languages</a>. With the exception of a
couple of bugs in our importer (<a href="http://devhawk.net/2009/08/07/pygments-for-windows-live-writer-v1-0-2/">discussed
here</a>)
it works great with IronPython. It’s also extensible, so I was able to
easily build a custom formatter to output exactly the HTML I want
inserted in my blog posts. So it made perfect sense to use Pygments as
the basis of a Windows Live Writer plugin.</p>

<p>As great a tool as Windows Live Writer is, it’s developers haven’t
exactly seen the light when it comes to dynamic languages. If you want
to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa702851.aspx">create a custom Content
Source</a> for
Windows Live Writer, you have to generate a compiled on-disk assembly
with a static type and custom attributes. Not exactly IronPython’s
forte, if you know what I mean. I did try and build a pure IronPython
solution, but eventually gave up. So I ended up building a hybrid
solution. The front end of the plugin as well as the UI elements are
written in C# while the syntax highlighter engine is written in
IronPython. And since this is running on the current .NET framework, I
didn’t have the new fangled C# 4.0 dynamic type to help me.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of blog posts, I want to highlight a few aspects
how I built this plugin, including compiling Python packages into
assemblies and invoking Python code from C# 3.0 and earlier. If you
want to look for your self, <a href="http://github.com/devhawk/pygments.wlwriter/tree/master">the
source</a> is up
on GitHub.</p>
