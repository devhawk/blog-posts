<p>Lots of meetings today, so my coffee post is late…</p>

<li>The Big News<sup>tm</sup>: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700830.aspx">Visual Studio
2008</a> and
.NET Framework 3.5 Beta 2 is <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx">available for
download</a>.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/07/26/announcing-the-release-of-visual-studio-2008-beta-2-net-fx-3-5-beta-2-and-silverlight-1-0-rc.aspx">Soma</a>
and
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/26/vs-2008-and-net-3-5-beta-2-released.aspx">Scott</a>
have more. Silverlight 1.0 RC and the Silverlight Add-in for VS08
will apparently be available in a couple of days. Finally, there’s a
go-live license for the framework, so you get a head-start deploying
apps before VS08 and NETFX 3.5 RTM. Time to build out a new VPC
image.</li>
<li>Next week, I’m attending the p&amp;p <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory/Wiki/View.aspx?title=CustomizationWorkshop">Service Factory v3 Customization
Workshop</a>.
I’m looking forward to playing with the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/donsmith/archive/2007/04/06/first-service-factory-v3-community-drop.aspx">new Service Factory
drop</a>,
but I’m really interested in learning more about building factories.
I wonder if they’re going to discuss their VS08 plans.</li>
<li>Nick Malik <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/07/21/what-you-need-to-make-middle-out-soa-architecture-work.aspx">recently
wrote</a>
about making “middle out SOA” work. I hate that term “middle-out”.
It feels like we’re pinning our hopes on middle-out because we know
top-down and bottom-up don’t work. My old boss <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/">John
DeVadoss</a> (who assures me he’ll be
blogging regularly again “soon”) big vs. little SOA, with big SOA
being “dead”. I like the term “little SOA” better than “middle-out
SOA”, but just because big SOA is a big failure, doesn’t mean little
SOA will make any headway.</li>
<li>There’s a new <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/a81e161e-1e4b-42cc-97c2-2ba9b0efba94/Details.aspx">F# drop
available</a>.
Don Syme <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/07/27/f-1-9-2-7-released.aspx">has the
details</a>.
Looks like they’ve got some interesting new constructs for async and
parallel programing.</li>
<li>ABC <a href="http://blogs.abc.com/fepblog/2007/07/hd-streaming-ha.html">announced
yesterday</a>
that they are streaming HD on <a href="http://dynamic.abc.go.com/streaming/landing">their
website</a>. So you can
check out the <a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Through_the_Looking_Glass">season
finale</a> of
Lost in HD for free. They embed commercials so it’s not really “for
free”, but you don’t have to pay $3 an episode like you do on XBLM.
I wonder if XBLM might offer this capability in the future?
Certainly would increase my use of XBLM. (as would an
all-you-can-eat pricing scheme)</li>
