As promised, I spent about half of yesterday at TechFest. Ran into some
folks I knew, met some new folks, the usual social networking stew of
these sorts of events. Here’s some of the stuff I saw. Much of the stuff
I saw wasn’t public, but everything below has either a public MSR page
or a brief description on the [TechFest demo
page](http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/demos.aspx).

-   [SecPAL](http://research.microsoft.com/projects/SecPAL/) – easily
    the most work-applicable demo I saw. SecPAL stands for “Security
    Policy Assertion Language”. It’s a language for expressing
    distributed authorization policies. We’re looking at authorization
    policies in the next phase of my MSIT project, so this was very
    timely.
-   [3D
    Video](http://research.microsoft.com/vision/cambridge/3dvideo/) -
    Take a garden variety video shot with a camcorder and add computer
    generated 3D objects into the scene automatically. I actually saw
    this last year, but this year they’ve added automatic occlusion. In
    other words, it automatically calculates when a real-world object
    passes in front of the computer generated object and renders
    accordingly. Check out [this
    video](http://research.microsoft.com/vision/cambridge/3dvideo/TechFest_Shadow_InDepth.wmv).
    This would be great for creating synthetic characters Jar-Jar Binks
    style (though hopefully less annoying)
-   Boku: Lightweight Programming for Kids – Sort of like LOGO, except
    beautifully rendered 3D, running on the Xbox 360 and programmed
    using an Xbox 360 game controller. Patrick’s not quite ready for
    this – Riley even less so - but I’ll be keeping an eye on this.
-   [F\#](http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp) – nothing really new
    here, but I got to meet Don Syme in person.
-   Telescopic Pixel - Sort of like an LED screen but using
    significantly less energy efficient and faster.
-   Podcast Authoring using Speech Recognition – Instead of the standard
    waveform view of recorded audio, this app feeds the spoken words
    thru the Microsoft speech recognition engine and allows the user to
    crop the audio simply by selecting words. Not mind blowing
    technology like some of the other stuff I saw, but certainly an
    interesting combination of technologies.
-   [Smart Workflow
    Foundation](http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?type=Technical%20Report&id=1160) -
    Adding constraint solving capabilities to WF. Must noodle on this.
