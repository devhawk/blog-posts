Training for 8 work days + pregnant wife = much less time for blogging.
But I did make it out to [Sam Ruby](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog)‘s
[Weblog Gathering](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1166.html). Full
list of attendee’s is available at [Anita Rowland’s
weblog](http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00000825.html) (no RSS
feed :cry:). Had a great time.

Highlight for me was meeting [Miguel de
Icaza](http://primates.helixcode.com/~miguel/activity-log.php) of the
[Mono](http://www.go-mono.com) project. He showed of Mono on his laptop
plus took the time to explain why they chose the licenses they did. But
the coolest part was first meeting him. When I realized who he was, I
introduced myself and expressed how impressed I was regarding Mono’s
progress. His response: “You guys have built a great platform.” I wish
all interactions between commercial & non-commercial software advocates
could be so respectful. (no flames please – I realize my employer has
been equally at fault for not being respectful. Hopefully, we’re
[changing that](http://news.com.com/2008-1082-981508.html).)
