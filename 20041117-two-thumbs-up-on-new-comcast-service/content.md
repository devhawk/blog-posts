and
[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/11/16.html#a8655) have
gotten their new ComCast boxes and apparently the service rocks. Mine
gets installed Sunday. 

(side note – Does anyone still use Scoble’s first name or has Scoble
transcended the whole first-name/last-name thing and moved directly to
single name status?)
