<p>Got to Phoenix only to discover I had left the charger for my

laptop</a>
(otherwise known as my “portable server”). Since I’m here to talk code,
maybe having a working laptop is a good idea. (My
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/05/29/new-tablet-for-harry/">tablet</a> is
going to be a good dev machine, but I haven’t gotten it entirely
configured yet). I drove around a while, looking for a replacement AC
adapter. Found what I thought was a <a href="http://www.frys.com">Fry’s
Electronics</a>, but was actually a <a href="http://www.frysfood.com/index.htm">Fry’s Food &amp;
Drug</a>. Luckily, there was a Best Buy
nearby. No AC adapter, but they did have the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/content_provider/film/T2DVD.aspx">T2: Extreme
Edition</a>
on sale so I picked it up. I eventually found a <a href="http://igo.ententeweb.com/mapfiles/juice.asp">universal AC
adapter</a> after visiting
two Radio Shacks, but frankly I wanted to check out T2. Unfortunately,
the “player recommendation” indicate that laptops don’t play the hi-def
version “due to the amount of data transfer required”. They weren’t
kidding. But even without being able to watch the hi-def version (<a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/06/01/i-want-my-hdtv-soon/">for
now</a>), it’s
got lots of great features. Audio commentary by James Cameron, lots of
new documentaries and on-the-set footage. Favorite toy: the Terminator
FX studio. You can import your own photos and either make morph videos
into the T1000 or create a “battle damaged” T800. I only have pictures
of my son with me, so I made a cool, but disturbing, photo of him as a
T800 with part of the cybernetics showing through.</p>
