<p>Obviously, there’s some fairly big news coming out of Las Vegas this
week. I’ll get to that either later today or tomorrow. In the meantime,
here’s what I did with my parents this past weekend.</p>
<ul>
<li>My parents arrived Thursday at the same time Patrick has to be
dropped off for school. My office is fairly close to his school, so
Julie dropped him off with me on her way to the airport. He and I
ate lunch together and then I took him to school. Always fun to
spend extra time with the kids.</li>
<li>Friday was Take Your Dad to Work day – at least it was for me. We
had a team lunch out and he sat in on a couple of meetings. He’s
spent quite a bit of time on IPv6 recently, so infrastructure
discussions like my group’s are right up his alley. According to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dotties/">one of my team’s PMs</a>, my meeting
behavior is “much better” when he’s around.</li>
<li>Saturday, we went to the <a href="http://www.museumofflight.org/">Museum of
Flight</a>. I don’t know who was more
excited, my son or my father. Dad’s favorite plane is the
<a href="http://www.museumofflight.org/Collection/Aircraft.asp?RecordKey=28077E43-0F70-40AB-B4B3-AA2AF8E6BB00">Blackbird</a>,
so he really enjoyed sitting in the <a href="http://www.museumofflight.org/Display.asp?Page=ExCockpits">SR-71
cockpit</a>.
It was raining the last time we went to the museum, so this was the
first time I had seen <a href="http://www.museumofflight.org/Collection/Aircraft.asp?RecordKey=8835E3E8-2D58-4DFE-87C9-1087DA0DD65B">Air Force
One</a>
and the
<a href="http://www.museumofflight.org/Display.asp?Page=Concorde">Concorde</a>.</li>
<li>Sunday, we watched the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=270429112">Mariners beat the
Royals</a>.
It’s been three long years in the basement for M’s fans, but they
have been slowly getting better year over year. Not sure they can
make the playoffs this year, but maybe they can at least finish over
.500.</li>
<li>Yesterday, we went to the <a href="http://www.zoo.org/">Woodland Park Zoo</a>.
My parents are members of <a href="http://fonz.org/">FONZ</a> and my kids love
the Zoo. We had fun, though after three and a half days of “go go
go” with my parents the kids were a bit worn down. The gorillas were
very active, banging on the glass and running away – sort of the
gorilla version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ding_Dong_Ditch">ding dong
ditch</a>. Another
highlight was getting to see the <a href="http://www.zoo.org/spotlight/ss.htm">tiger
cub</a>.</li>
<li>My parents flew home last night on the red eye, and everyone is very
sad to see them go. It had been about eight months since we had seen
them. Here’s hoping it won’t be that long before the next visit.</li>
</ul>
