I’m still digging out my inbox after my two week vacation. I’m down to
134 items from nearly 400 this morning. I *was* at 16 before I left. If
it gets this bad in two weeks, what’s going to happen when I take my
four week paternity leave?

While I’m getting up to date on email, I am way way way behind on blog
reading. But I did see that [Gareth](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj) is
[promoting](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/05/10/416085.aspx)
a [web
chat](http://www.microsoft.com/communities/chats/default.mspx#05_0524_DN_VS05)
about the DSL toolkit tomorrow at 9am Pacific time. Here’s the abstract:

> **Using the Domain-Specific Languages Tools for Visual Studio 2005**

> Domain-specific language tools lay the foundation for software
> factories by providing a framework and a set of tools for delivering
> domain-specific visual designers that plug into Visual Studio Team
> System. These designers could be tools for industry verticals, such as
> the health care or telecommunications industries or, they could be
> tools for development across numerous disciplines, such as
> object-oriented modeling and architecture. The Microsoft Tools for
> Domain-Specific Languages is part of the Visual Studio 2005 SDK.

Now if we could just get a copy of the [DSL
toolkit](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/dsltools)
that runs on Beta 2!
