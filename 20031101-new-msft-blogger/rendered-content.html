<p>My ex-teammate Jeromy Carriere has <a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/jeromyc/">started a
blog</a>. Or should I say he
started a blog months ago but only recently started writing anything but
test posts. He was part of a panel @ OOPSLA (which was happening
concurrently with PDC) on app servers, which he <a href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/jeromyc/posts/3031.aspx">describes in
detail</a>.</p>
<p>So that makes one <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0125998/">current teammate</a>
and two ex-teammates who are blogging. (The other ex-teammate is <a href="http://rickculpepper.net/">Rick
Culpepper</a>, who left MSFT in search of less
traveled pastures.) I think that number needs to go up.</p>
