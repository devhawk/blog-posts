I got my [Lingo](https://www.lingo.com/) phone set up last night. It was
mind-numbingly easy:

1.  Ignore included directions which tell you to turn off the computer,
    router and cable modem. (maybe you unplug the microwave just to be
    sure)
2.  Plug Lingo VoIP box into router
3.  Plug Lingo VoIP box into phone
4.  Plug Lingo VoIP box into power outlet
5.  Wait for VoIP light to come on

We made a few calls, both locally and to our family & friends in Europe.
I couldn’t hear any difference in quality from our normal land line.
We’re going to run with both in parallel for a while, and then I’m going
to cut back the services on the land line. I figure I don’t want to shut
it off completely for SLA reasons – it works when the power’s out and in
the very rare occasions that the internet connection is down. Otherwise,
I figure I’ll be completely switched over in a month or so.

BTW, like other VoIP vendors, Lingo offers incentives to sign up your
friends. If you want Lingo and an extra \$25 credit, [drop me a
