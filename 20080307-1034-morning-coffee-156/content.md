-   My hockey team won last night 4-2. No points for me, but I was even
    on the night. I did spend some time in the penalty box, but I was
    serving a two many men on the ice bench minor. We only had nine
    skaters, not enough for two full lines, so I’m pretty tired today.
    However, I’m not as tired as I was two weeks ago – that’s a good
    sign.
-   Politics 2.0 watch: The Obama campain [announced
    yesterday](http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/samgrahamfelsen/gGB3YB)
    that they raised \$55 million in donations in the month of February.
    That’s significantly more than Clinton ([\$35
    million](http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0208/Clinton_raises_35_million_in_February.html))
    and McCain ([\$12
    million](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/02/29/mccain-raises-12-million-in-january/))
    combined. Even more impressive is that \$45 million of that was
    raised online, of which \$40 million were from donations of \$100 or
    less and \$22.5 million were from donations of \$25 or less. I guess
    in Politics 2.0, individuals contribute more than [online
    punditry](http://devhawk.net/CategoryView,category,Politics.aspx)
    and [video parodies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbknhX383A) of
    [political commercials](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7bzdj9RlG4).
-   [TextGlow](http://www.textglow.net/) is a Sivlerlight 2 based Word
    docx file viewer, [created
    by](http://james.newtonking.com/archive/2008/03/06/silverlight-2-0-ooxml-textglow.aspx)
    James Newton-King. Nice, but what I really want is “SlideGlow”, a
    SL2 based PPTX file viewer. (via

-   Speaking of Silverlight, Windows Live launched an experimental site
    called [PhotoZoom](http://photozoom.mslivelabs.com/) which will let
    you create DeepZoom photo albums. (via

-   Charlie Calvert [has
    created](http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/03/05/future-focus-ii-call-hierarchy.aspx)
    a home for [Language Futures
    discussion](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vslangfutures/) on MSDN
    Code Gallery. If you’ll recall, back in January he asked for input
    on [Dynamic
    Lookup](http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/01/25/future-focus.aspx).
    Now he’s looking for feedback on [Call
    Hierarchy](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vslangfutures/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Call%20Hierarchy&referringTitle=Home),
    a proposed VS IDE feature to help you visualize how your code flows.
    Great idea, but the [Call Hierarchy dialog
    mockup](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vslangfutures/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Call%20Hierarchy&referringTitle=Home)
    isn’t very intuitive. Couldn’t we put these visualizations into the
    code editor window directly, like
    [CodeRush](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/CodeRush/)
    does?

    [Flickr image browser in Managed
    JScript](http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-1.html) then
    showing how to integrate an [IronRuby version of the Flickr image
