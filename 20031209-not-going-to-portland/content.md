I hear [Jim Blizzard](http://snowstormlife.com/blog/) is having another
[Portland Nerd Dinner](http://snowstormlife.com/blog/posts/431.aspx). I
wanted to go meet [Rory](http://neopoleon.com/blog/) in person, maybe
see [Scott](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) (who I haven’t seen since KL
last year) and continue a conversation I was having with
[Chris](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/) last week on campus. Not going to
make it this time. I could use the holidays as an excuse, but the truth
is that I’ve got an early morning all-hands division meeting to see
[Return of the King](http://www.lordoftherings.net/film/trilogy/) and
I’d like to get more than three hours of sleep.
