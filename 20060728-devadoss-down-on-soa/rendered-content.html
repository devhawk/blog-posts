<p>My <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/michael_platt">old
boss’s</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados">boss</a>
seems like he was in a downer mood yesterday. First, he blogged about
the “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2006/07/27/680756.aspx">Myth of Reuse in
SOA</a>“,
then the “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2006/07/27/680765.aspx">Achilles Heel of
SOA</a>“.
Actually, truth be told, I agree with him on both counts.</p>
<p>I slam the door on the reuse argument every time it comes up in my new
job. Actually, I slam the door on what I call “Naive Reuse”. When John
talks factoring for agility, he’s talking about a form of reuse –
similar to how use “reuse” code when you refactor. What does it mean to
refactor service? How about refactoring your enterprise?</p>
<p>As for the Achilles Heel “data problem”, I think that’s an artifact of
the prevailing stateless request/response mindset most people have about
services that I <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/Devhawk/%7E3/6182983/Services+Arent+Stateless.aspx">touched
on</a>
yesterday. I think Pat Helland
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/dataoutsideinside.asp">described</a>
a very good approach for dealing with data in an SOA, but I haven’t seen
it implemented broadly. Rest assured, many of the concepts Pat described
are at the forefront of my thinking as my new project takes shape.</p>
