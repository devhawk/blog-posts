<p>The more I understand about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/winmedia/default.mspx">Windows Media Services
9</a>,
the more I like it. I especially like the fact that can create your own
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmsrvsdk/htm/creatingdatasourceplugins.asp">data source
plug-in</a>
as part of a <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/04/20/broadcasting-music/">custom broadcasting
solution</a>.
However, one quick gotcha – you can only use custom plug-ins with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmsrvsdk/htm/windowsnetenterpriseserversupport.asp">WS03
Enterprise
Edition</a>.
Didn’t realize until I had built and configured my virtual media server
and compiled the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmsrvsdk/htm/datasourcepluginsample.asp">sample data source
plug-in</a>.
Annoying, but not the end of the world.</p>
