<p>It’ felt touch and go at times, but I did manage to make it thru PDC
prep, PDC itself, shipping <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=17404">IPy 2.0
RC1</a>
and Halloween relatively unscathed. I was Superman for Halloween – the
perils of letting the five year old pick everyone’s costume, we
we’re *all* Superman (well, Jules and Riley were Supergirl) – but
given how exhausted I was, I could have skipped the costume and just
gone as a zombie.</p>
<p>My inbox is currently just under 500 messages, I’ve got a mountain of
stuff to finish for IPy RTM, I’m presenting at the <a href="http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2008/west2008.aspx">p&amp;p
Summit</a> and I’m finally
get some attention from the legal dept (now that we’re past PDC). In
other words, it’s not the end of PDC is ushering in a golden age of zero
work for Harry. But with PDC in my rear view mirror, I don’t feel quite
so overwhelmed as I did.</p>
<p>And on top of all this, I’ve been borderline obsessed with election
news. I’ve basically given up on all my non-political blog reading – if
I hadn’t been working on PDC I might not have even been aware of the big
announcements like Oslo and Azure. Things are looking good for Obama and
the Democrats, but as this <a href="https://donate.barackobama.com/page/contribute/finishline1">hilarious video
shows</a>
“Being in a good position to win is not the same as winning.” I haven’t
had the time to volunteer for Obama but my father has been volunteering
for Obama in Northern Virginia – aka “<a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hby_5Pku5ywmfC_rEtEV5BcYKR5gD93KDFPO0">communist
country</a>”.
It sure would be nice to see my home state go blue.</p>
