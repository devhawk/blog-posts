<p>Several languages, such as
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/node7.html#SECTION007300000000000000000">Python</a>,
have the concept of a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple#Usage_in_computer_science">Tuple</a>
built into the lanugage. One of things it’s used for in Python is
multiple return values. So you can call “return x,y” to return two
values. Of course, C# can only return one. If you need to return more
values, you have to define out parameters.</p>
<p>LINQ / C# 3.0 / VB 9 support the idea of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/vb9overview.asp?frame=true#vb9overview_topic5">anonymous
types</a>,
which is similar to a tuple. The big difference is that, because they’re
anonymous, they can’t leave the scope they’re defined in. In other
words, they’re great within a function, but if you want to pass them out
of your function type-safely, you have to define a non-anonymous type
for them.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough,
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">F#</a> supports
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/manual/quicktour.aspx#QuickTourTuples">tuples</a>,
though it a bit of a hack. Since the CLR doesn’t support tuples, F#
basically <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/manual/export-interop.aspx#Tuples">defines different Tuple
classes</a>
for up to seven tuple parameters (i.e. Tuple&lt;t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6,t7&gt;),
For .NET 1.x, it’s even worse – they have to define different type names
(Tuple2, Tuple3, etc). Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://strangelights.com/blog/">Robert Pickering</a> pointed
out that F#’s tuple implementation is entirely transparent inside of
F#. He’s right – I was writing from the perspective of a C# developer
using F#’s implementation of tuples. Maybe I need to be looking closer
at F#?</p>
