I’ve updated my [SharePoint RSS Feed Generator](prj_sharepointsynd.aspx)
to version 0.2. Primary new feature: RSS feeds for individual lists. As
I mentioned in my last post, I’m on vacation next week, so v0.3 will be
a while. Current top features being considered for v0.3 are an OPML feed
and modifying the WSS UI to include links to RSS feeds (both web feeds
and list feeds).

I’ve also been working on a tool to help me explore the Windows
SharePoint database. Any interest in that?
