Microsoft recently shipped beta 3 of the [Speech Application
SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/speech/techinfo/sdkoverviewbeta3/) which
allows developer to build voice response telephone apps as well as
multi-modal web apps for desktop and pocket IE (with [Microsoft Speech
Server](http://www.microsoft.com/speech/evaluation/tools/) which just
went beta 1) . But you could only get the SDK by [ordering a
CD](http://216.162.203.249/speech/ordersdk.asp). Not being the patient
sort, I downloaded it internally (one of the many benefits of being
b0rg). Now, all the impatient people can write speech enabled web apps,
since the SDK [showed
up](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=39399251-2b0e-498a-9695-21cd7becbf2a)
on MS Downloads today. Enjoy.
