<p>Microsoft recently shipped beta 3 of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/speech/techinfo/sdkoverviewbeta3/">Speech Application
SDK</a> which
allows developer to build voice response telephone apps as well as
multi-modal web apps for desktop and pocket IE (with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/speech/evaluation/tools/">Microsoft Speech
Server</a> which just
went beta 1) . But you could only get the SDK by <a href="http://216.162.203.249/speech/ordersdk.asp">ordering a
CD</a>. Not being the patient
sort, I downloaded it internally (one of the many benefits of being
b0rg). Now, all the impatient people can write speech enabled web apps,
since the SDK <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=39399251-2b0e-498a-9695-21cd7becbf2a">showed
up</a>
on MS Downloads today. Enjoy.</p>
