    "content": "The one thing I'll give you is that Gov. Palin will be back, but I do hope it's not through the Senate.  Fortunately for us ;) Senators don't make long lasting Presidents.\n\nBush, Clinton, Reagan, FDR, Wilson were all two+ term Presidents who came from the Governor's office.  You have to go back to 1837 when the last former Senator finished a 2nd term.  And even then, both Jackson and Monroe were Governors after their Senate service.\n\nClinton got a pass with the .com bubble, a weakend Russia and Mr. Newt.  Obama faces a world more like 1976 and we know what happened to Carter.  \n\nSome tickets I think will handly beat OB'12, Palin-Crist, Jindal-Crist, Romney-Huckabee, Romney-Pawlenty, Palin-Fiorina.\n\nOh, this is funny, we'll have Barack Obama & Biden, BOB, in the Whitehouse.  Snicker, snicker."

Though as you state, 8 years or so will give her the opportunity to learn the things she needs to to lead. Here's hoping, when her crowd started chanting her name all I could think of was Eva Peron and I had chills (not the good kind). But underestimate her? How could anyone underestimate her? You never turn your back on the ocean, or a crocodile, or a shark and she is worse them all those :)\n"

Tell you what, why don't you put your real name on your prediction so we can circle back in four years and see who was right?\n\n@Julie Yeah, I wish for a better representative of your \"team\" than Palin as well. \n\nBTW, to be clear I don't think Palin can \"learn the things she needs to to lead\" in 8 years or a lifetime for that matter - leadership is one of those things you have or you don't. Not to say she doesn't have it - I haven't seen enough of her to make a decision one way or the other. Certainly, she can excite the Republican base, but that's not leadership. Furthermore, it remains to be seen if she can appeal to voters outside the wack-job core. "

    "content": "I'm not sure I believe that Palin will have the sense to wait for 2016 -- if she runs in 2012 I would expect her to go down in flames, although of course it depends on how the Obama administration fares.  As you say, he ran an unbelievably well-organized campaign in two difficult elections, so I'm optimistic.\n\nI'm guessing the Republicans' best hope in 2016 is Bobby Jindal, but they won't go for it.\n\nAs for the Democrats, I imagine you're right about \"the next Obama\" emerging later.  People have pointed at Newark mayor Cory Booker.  Not that the next Obama needs to be black.  A woman would of course be great.  \n\nYour anonymous correspondent above doesn't necessarily deserve to be rebutted point-by-point, but I do think the idea that Senators can't be two-term presidents is nonsense.  The only Senator to be elected to the Presidency in the modern era was JFK, and I think he would certainly have been reelected had he survived his first term.  Besides, Truman was a Senator, and essentially served two terms as President (having assumed the Presidency after only a few weeks as VP).\n\n"

Of those 3, two were also previously governors.\n\nThe only Senator to win a second term without a governorship is...drumroll please...Richard Nixon.\n\nJust to clarify, 5 modern (since 1900 at least) Senators have won an election: Nixon, LBJ, JFK, Truman and Harding.\n\nLarger point being that I believe Governors make better Presidents.  Yes, McCain was in the same boat.\n\nI apologize for the pseudonym.  It won't happen again."
