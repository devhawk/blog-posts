We keep getting more and more field architects and architecture strategy
team members blogging. Remember, I [keep a
list](http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx) (I am becoming the Scoble of
Microsoft Architecture). [Anna Liu](http://blogs.msdn.com/annali) is a
field architect evangelist who [presented at TechEd
Australia](http://blogs.msdn.com/annali/archive/2004/08/05.aspx) (but we
didn’t get a chance to hang out). Anna’s also been thinking about
[software development as an engineering
discipline](http://blogs.msdn.com/annali/archive/2004/08/11.aspx).

In addition to Anna, two of my teammates are blogging: [Chris
Keyser](http://blogs.msdn.com/chriskeyser) and [Dave
Welsh](http://blogs.msdn.com/dave_welsh). Chris is a solution architect
who’s doing some awesome next gen SOA work. He’s been
[blogging](http://blogs.msdn.com/chriskeyser/archive/2004/08/18/216640.aspx)[about](http://blogs.msdn.com/chriskeyser/archive/2004/08/19/217525.aspx)
using WSE2 to manage Security Context Tokens. Chris, like [John
deVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados) (who has relapsed into
silence), is very pragmatic so it’s great to run radical ideas past him.

Earlier this year, our team “inherited” a group of awesome vertical
architects – I’ve blogged about [John
Evdemon](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon) before who’s from that group.
[Dave](http://blogs.msdn.com/dave_welsh) is also from that group. Like
many of our vertical architects, Dave is heavily involved in standards
bodies – in Dave’s case it’s [UN/CEFACT](http://www.unece.org/cefact/).
He’s got an [great
article](http://blogs.msdn.com/dave_welsh/archive/2004/08/16/215428.aspx)
on how Standards Development Organizations traditionally work and
[another](http://blogs.msdn.com/dave_welsh/archive/2004/08/17/216038.aspx)
on how MSFT (and our specification partners) is improving on that
process. He’s shining a light on the dark corners of the standard
process, which is a good thing since so many people act like standards
are a silver bullet solution. I love Dave’s description of the
traditional standards process:

> [L]aunch a committee, politically pick a chair, generate lots of hype
> and expectation on how this spec will solve world hunger, stack the
> new committee with people who may be able to contribute, host
> conference calls and arm wrestle the original idea down to some
> compromise that seems to make sense, then hope someone’s got a number
> of free weekends over to write up a draft of the new spec.

You want an example of the results of a traditional standards process?
How about XSD? I think XSD is the ugliest widely-used spec around. 
[Don](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/) agrees, according to his
[comments](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20030827SOAPDB/manifest.xml)
from last years [SellsCon](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/conference/):

I’m with Don and
[Tim](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2004/08/16/1892.aspx):
I want [RelaxNG](http://www.relaxng.org/). More importantly, I want
standards that are built like WS-\* and RelaxNG.
