<p>Neither SharpReader nor RSS Bandit renders my business card nicely. They
both strip out or otherwise deactivate the CSS tags that are used in
rendering the card. So go <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/10/13/reading-writing-and-business-cards/">my web
site</a> if you
want to see the card “for real”.</p>
<p>Raises an interesting question. How much support should syndication
feeds like RSS have for look and feel?</p>
