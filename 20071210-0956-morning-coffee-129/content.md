-   Short coffee this morning, as I’m home with a tweaked ankle.
-   I started playing [Indigo
    Prophecy](http://www.xbox.com/games/indigoprophecy) over the
    weekend. It’s an original Xbox game, released as part of the new
    Xbox Originals program. It has a [good metacritic
    score](http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/fahrenheit)
    (84), though apparently it wasn’t much of a retail success. I’m
    enjoying it, though it’s not very challenging. It’s more an
    interactive movie than a game. Good story, though.
-   The ASP.NET MVC preview dropped today, Scott Guthrie [has the
    details](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/09/asp-net-3-5-extensions-ctp-preview-released.aspx).
    Scott Hanselman has a [40 minute how-to
    video](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNET35ExtensionsPlusMVCHowToScreencast.aspx)
    and Phil Haack has
    [several](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/12/09/writing-unit-tests-for-controller-actions.aspx)[articles](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/12/09/extending-asp.net-mvc-to-add-conventions.aspx)
    up
    [already](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/12/07/tdd-and-dependency-injection-with-asp.net-mvc.aspx).
-   Speaking of ASP.NET MVC and Scott Guthrie, he’s got another post in
    his series on ASP.NET MVC. This time, he’s covering [how to handle
    form input / POST
    data](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/09/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-4-handling-form-edit-and-post-scenarios.aspx).
-   Erik Meijer [has posted](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2563)
    some of his thoughts on [Volta](http://labs.live.com/volta/). He’s
    one of the guys behind Volta, so it’s worth a good look. ([via Dare
    Obasanjo](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/12/09/MicrosoftVoltaTurningTraditionalWebDevelopmentOnItsHead.aspx))
-   Late Addition – the ASP.NET Extensions is more than just the MVC
    stuff. It also includes AJAX improvements, Silverlight support,
    [ADO.NET Data
    Services](http://blogs.msdn.com/astoriateam/archive/2007/12/10/ado-net-data-services-project-astoria-ctp-is-released.aspx)
    and ASP.NET Dynamic Data Support. [Data
    Services](http://astoria.mslivelabs.com/) (formerly Astoria) let’s
    you easily expose your database via RESTful services. I think
    Dynamic Data Support used to be code named
    [Jasper](http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2007/04/30/project-codename-jasper-announced-at-mix-07.aspx).
    It’s a “rich scaffolding framework” for ASP.NET. I assume that’s to
    compete w/ Ruby on Rails.
