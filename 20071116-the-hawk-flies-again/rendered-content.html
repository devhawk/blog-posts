<p>After a week offline, I think I’ve finally gotten DevHawk back online.
I’m having a few issues from my personal laptop, so if you’re having
issues seeing the site, please <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net">let me know</a>.</p>
<p>I took the downtime to make a few changes to the site. I fixed up a few
things with the theme – I run 120 DPI on both my machines and the theme
looked wrong in a few places. Now, except for the main text, I specify
font sizes in pixels instead of points so it looks right whatever DPI
you run in. Also, I finally got around to updating the stylesheet so the
tag list and calendar renders correctly plus I added “older posts” and
“newer posts” links at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>I also took the opportunity to get rid of my Projects, Articles and
Presentations sections. I didn’t trash the content, I moved it all <a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content">to
my
SkyDrive</a>.
But now I’ve eliminated a bunch of pages from my site that I just never
took the time to keep up to date.</p>
<p>Back to regular blogging “soon”.</p>
