<p>I realize yesterday I said I was on vacation starting today. In reality,
I’m not going to the office today, but I have time to post this before
my vacation starts in earnest.</p>
<ul>
<li>I hit <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/zeroemailbounce.aspx">Zero Email
Bounce</a> in advance
of my vacation. It’s been quite a while since the last time I got
here and I hope to hit it much more often in the future.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718368.aspx">DSL tools
team</a>
shipped a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bfba74af-4f28-44cc-8de5-0c3c55d21863&amp;displaylang=en">Designer Integration
PowerToy</a> that
allows you to integrate models from multiple DSL designers into a
single authoring tool. Gareth has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2007/02/16/announcing-designer-integration-powertoy.aspx">more
here</a>.</li>
<li>Assorted PowerShell links: <a href="http://www.powershellanalyzer.com/">PowerShell
Analyzer</a> and
<a href="http://www.powershell.com/">PowerShellIDE</a>. Both look interesting.</li>
<li>Personally, I like
<a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a> but apparently
the only way to add a new syntax highlight scheme requires modifying
the source code. Ugh. Anyone out there already added PS support to
Notepad2? How about a suggestion for a simple text editor that
supports extensible syntax highlighting?</li>

all commented on my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/06/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-wcf/">long running services WCF
post</a>.
Tomas mentions Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) which looks
to be developing an open spec queuing system like MSMQ or MQ series.
Interesting, but given the lack of involvement of the major MQ and
DB vendors, I’m hard pressed to imagine this gaining any kind of
critical mass.</li>
