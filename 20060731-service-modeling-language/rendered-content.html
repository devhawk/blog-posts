<p>On the one hand, this seems like a somewhat arbitrary name change – from
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/sdm.mspx">System Defintion
Model</a> to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/serviceml.mspx">Service Modeling
Language</a>.
And the use of the term “Service” instead of “System” seems sketchy to
me.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you gotta love this line from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jul06/07-31SMLPR.mspx">press
release</a>:
“The group plans to submit the draft specification to an industry
standards organization later this year.” Given the companies involved in
“the group” – MSFT, IBM, BEA, Sun, Dell, BMC, Cicso, Intel, HP and EMC –
you gotta think SML has a bright future.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that publishing the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/dsi/serviceml.mspx">SML
spec</a>
is the first step in a public-workshop-based revision process, a la the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/community/workshops/default.aspx">Web Services Protocol
Workshops</a>.</p>
