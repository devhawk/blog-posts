I hadn’t realized it, but Microsoft Research is [RSS
Enabled](http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/rss/) with seperate
feeds for [news](http://research.microsoft.com/rss/news.xml),
[downloads](http://research.microsoft.com/rss/downloads.xml) and
[publications](http://research.microsoft.com/rss/publications.xml). As
you would expect, there’s some cool stuff up there. The current headline
caught my eye: [Concurrent Programming Enters Atomic
Age](http://research.microsoft.com/displayArticle.aspx?id=1313). We
spent some time discussing this with the ARC MVPs, so it was fresh in my
mind.
