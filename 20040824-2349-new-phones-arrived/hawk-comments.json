    "content": "Actually, I just bought the same type of accessories from eBay for my Motorola T721, and they were really good. The shipping is a total rip-off, true (they charge you S/H per item and then actually ship them together! Very lame.), but I was happy with everything overall. Quick service and great products.\n\nI don't think I used PhoneStations specifically, but one of the many other little vendors that make their livings off of eBay.\n\nFWIW, I would do it again. And, it's cheaper then going down to your local mobile shop and buying them.\n\n\nLater Harry!\n-Jason",
