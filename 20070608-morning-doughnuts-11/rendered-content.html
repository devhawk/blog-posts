<p>Harry will be back on Monday so I will returning to blogging on my
<a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/">website</a>, while I will let the

break). I agree with Harry‚Äôs

that I really want to get something built so that we can talk about more
than theoretical models. Like last time I appreciate the opportunity to
sub for the master this last week. I hope that you found some of my
entries interesting.</p>

I enjoyed that post because I just celebrated the end of my first
year here at Microsoft. At this point I am not sure what I have
contributed, but I have learned a great deal and want to apply that
knowledge over the next year to help the company to succeed. We
really do have great people and great technologies.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.nba.com/sonics/">Seattle/Oklahoma City Sonics</a> hired
a GM who is only

You know you must be getting old when the people running the sports
teams are younger than you.

He comes from the Spurs organization though so at least he has a
background from a successful franchise.</li>

I heartedly agree with this endorsement as the book is excellent.</li>
<li>It looks like there are going to be more family friendly

was trying to find some games my 4 year old with the broken leg
could play I realized how many games I have that wouldn‚Äôt be
appropriate for him. This is very good news in my opinion.</li>
