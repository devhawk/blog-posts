A customer who reads my blog (and I think would rate me in the 7-9
range) sent me links to an
[article](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item.jhtml?id=3583&t=organizations) and
[book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060391685/002-4873027-5920803)
on Storytelling. The .NET & web services vision makes a great story. If
you look at my [old .NET Vision PPT](presentations/net_vision.ppt),
there is a real-world integration scenario. There are two slides – how
it’s done today, and how it would be done with web services. I haven’t
thought about it in terms of protagonists and antagonists, but the
foundation is there.
