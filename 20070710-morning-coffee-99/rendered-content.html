<li>Mladen Prajdic has a <a href="http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/07/06/60250.aspx">great
post</a>
on handling a database in your unit tests. He mentions
<a href="http://www.ndbunit.org/">NDbUnit</a> but seems mostly to favor SQL
2005′s database snapshot feature. He’s got sample code for creating
and restoring a snapshot. (via

1.5</a>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/jul07/07-09msrspr.mspx">released yesterday</a>.
Tandy Trower – GM of the Robotics group – <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/robotics/bb625969.aspx">has the
details</a> on
what’s new.</li>
<li>Herb Sutter has a <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/architect/200001985">new
column</a> in Dr. Dobbs on
concurrency. First up, “building a consistent mental model for
reasoning about concurrency”. Sounds like a must read column. (via

<li>Scott Hanselman
<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SezYouArchitectureAndTheArchitectureNinja.aspx">describes</a>
“Sez You Architecture”. I wonder, do architecture ninjas get to wear
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinobi_shozoku">Shinobi shozoku</a>?</li>
<li>From the Not Everyone Agrees With DevHawk Dept.: Libor Soucek
<a href="http://lsblog.wordpress.com/2007/07/05/avoid-durable-messages-in-enterprise-services/">disagrees with
me</a>
and thinks that durable messaging should be avoided. I had a hard
time following Libor’s logic but needless to say, I disagree with
his disagreement. He writes that one of the reasons to use DM is for
“Cooperating on transaction with external system”. While multiple
systems may be cooperating on a <em>business</em> transaction, in no way do
I believe they are going to cooperate on a <em>database</em> transaction.
But since he started talking about <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684146.aspx">the
DTC</a>, I
suspect we’re talking past each other. Libor, <a href="mailto:harry.pierson@microsoft.com">drop me a
line</a> and
we can discuss further.</li>
