-   I finally found a use for the [free SOA book I
    got](http://devhawk.net/2006/09/27/thoughts-on-the-soa-workshop/)
    from attending that Thomas Erl workshop. I’m using it to prop up one
    end of my daughter’s mattress while she’s sick so she can sleep
    better.
-   Jeff Tash states axiomatically that [CASE has evolved into
    Enterprise
    Architecture](http://www.flashmapsystems.com/resources/articles/articles17.htm). I
    agree with his points about why software construction isn’t like
    manufacturing, but he seems to be describing
    [BDUF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDUF) rather than EA. I’m
    anti-BDUF too, but why blame EA? (via [John
    deVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2007/03/24/case-and-enterprise-architecture.aspx))

    [comments](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=839) on my
    [SaaS/SOA
    post](http://devhawk.net/2007/03/21/when-is-a-service-not-a-service/)
    and wonders if SOA should stand for “SOA Oriented Architecture”. He
    also [writes](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=840) that
    most organizations these days don’t have an SOA, they have an AOS,
    “Agglomeration Of Services”. So true, so true.
-   JD Meier [talks
    up](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmeier/archive/2007/03/26/vsts-guidance-project-update.aspx)
    the new [VSTS guidance](http://www.codeplex.com/VSTSGuidance)
    available on CodePlex. Looks like some good stuff in there. I like
    how the p&p guys are moving from documents to wikis to deliver their
    guidance.
-   I’ve held off on getting the HD-DVD drive for my Xbox, but I think
    I’m going to cave soon, where soon == about two months. That’s when
    [The Matrix
    Trilogy](http://www.engadgethd.com/2007/03/21/matrix-trilogy-to-hit-hd-dvd-may-22nd-blu-ray-later-this-year/)
    is released on HD-DVD. Right around my birthday too, how convienent.
