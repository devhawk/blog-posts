Hardly the worthy recipient of \"major kudos\" -- he is merely the flavor of the month.  And he is in the media as well.  Uh-oh...recursive...\n\nThirdly, as you correctly say, Moore is not masquerading as the supposedly unbiased evening news.  But neither is Limbaugh.  Both pretend to be telling you \"the truth\", but like Stewart, they are primarily ENTERTAINERS, not newsmen.\n\n",

Certainly, Moore and Limbaugh both offer radically different versions of the \"truth\", but at least in Seattle Limbaugh appears on a radio station who's tagline is \"News & Views you won't hear anywhere else.\" Also appearing on that radio statio is Bill O'Reilly who is nearly as conservative and also has a primetime show on Fox News. Sean Hannity is also on Fox News - both the TV cable network and radio network (at least in Seattle - I don't know about other markets). ",
