For those who read my site in a news reader, I added a TechEd 2004 flair
to my site. The TechEd site recently posted the sessions names for the
[Architecture Track](http://www.msteched.com/content/breakouts.aspx#a7c12aff-c193-4de3-977c-a8623c7acbe3)
as well as the abstract for the [Architecture PreConference
Session](http://www.msteched.com/content/precons.aspx#PRC003). Get more
info @ the [TechEd home page](http://go.microsoft.com/?LinkID=404299).
