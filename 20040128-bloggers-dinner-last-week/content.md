I haven’t had time to blog last weeks [blogger
dinner](http://www.thenyoudiscover.com/weblog/archives/001520.html) in
Seattle. I had a great time. Scoble and I drove over with Deepak from
the [MSN TV](http://msntv.com/pc/default.aspx) group. I spent quite a
while talking to [Steve](http://hyperthink.net/blog/) about syndicating
reference data, which builds on his recent SOA posts (more on that
later). The coolest new thing this time was meeting Eric Promislow, a
[senior
developer](http://www.activestate.com/Corporate/People/Senior_Developers.html)
with [ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/). Eric is responsible for
[Visual Perl](http://www.activestate.com/Products/Visual_Perl/), [Visual
Python](http://www.activestate.com/Products/Visual_Python/) and [Visual
XSLT](http://www.activestate.com/Products/Visual_XSLT/) (and apparently
[the Baconizer](http://www.baconizer.com/)). One of the Visual XSLT
developers was also there, but I missed his name (sorry). The three of
us had a very interesting discussion on dynamic languages (something I
know little about) and language design (something I know a moderate
amount about). I know [Ward](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham) is a
perl guy, so maybe I should give Visual Perl a whirl.

I also got to ~~rant about~~ explain my view of SOA to
[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) on the way home. Lucky him.
