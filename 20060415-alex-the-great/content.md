My brother sent me this [great compliation
video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3957094422427700341) of
[Alexander
Ovechkinâ€™s](http://www.washingtoncaps.com/team/player.asp?player_id=17)
first year in the NHL. In the words of Barry Melrose, the [Calder
Trophy](http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/trophies/calder.html) has
been a one man race for some time now. Congrats to Alex on being only
the second rookie to score 50 goals and 100 points his first season.
