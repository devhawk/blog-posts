<p>Day one of SAF was great, if short. It didn’t get started until 2PM so
people could fly in that morning. The event is held @ the MS Conference
Center on campus. The MSCC is pretty sterile, like most conference
centers, so we bring in comfy furniture, rugs, zen gardens, fountains,
plants so the rooms have a much friendlier feel to them. The only
technology trappings are that the main meeting room is ringed with
shared PCs and we have a ton of power strips strategically placed though
mostly out of site under furniture. We also have bookshelves – the
content of which is pretty funny. Mostly knick-knacks and very few
books. The one closest to me has two books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679764208/102-8801487-9011317?v=glance">Hunting
Dinosaurs</a>
and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/NapaValley/1132/christmas.html#Great%20Taste%20Low%20Fat%20Holiday%20Cooking">Great Taste-Low Fat Holiday
Cooking</a>.
Interesting choices for an architect event. Of course, we’re not
expecting anyone to sit and read.</p>
<p>We had two keynotes yesterday: Pat Helland and David Campbell. For those
following along at home, yes they presented the first two sessions @ the
PDC Architecture Symposium. While the content was similar (baring
changes Pat made @ 10pm Sunday night to adjust to the new PPT template),
the big new addition was the launch of our new “Metropolis” metaphor. I
hope to get this deck posted to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/">architecture
center</a> soon, but the basic
idea is to draw an analogy between the way cities evolved in the late
1800′s with the advent of the railroad and the ways IT shops will evolve
with the advent of the Internet. It’s a very interesting metaphor that I
think we can learn a lot about where we are headed in this industry.
More when we get the deck posted.</p>
<p>Today, we are having mostly breakout discussions. Instead of big
breakout sessions, a la the PDC, we limit our discussion breakouts to
around fifteen customers plus the MSFT speaker, moderator and note
taker. Today, I’m moderating discussions on Envisioning the Service
Oriented Enterprise and Microsoft’s Internal Approach to Enterprise
Architecture. I’ll blog on those later. We also have a keynote by John
Shewchuk, architect from the Indigo team. Should be quite a day.</p>
