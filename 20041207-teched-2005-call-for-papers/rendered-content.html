<p>BTW, speaking of TechEd 2005, we’re currently inviting potential
presenters to submit proposals to speak.
<a href="http://atlasbrandview.blogspot.com/">Norman</a> is taking over ownership
of the Architecture track, but I’m still responsible for technical
content and community for the track. If you’re interested in presenting
at TechEd on any topic, head over to the <a href="http://www.msteched.com/cfp/CallForPapers.aspx">TechEd 2005 Call For
Papers</a> website.
Proposals are due by the end of December.</p>
