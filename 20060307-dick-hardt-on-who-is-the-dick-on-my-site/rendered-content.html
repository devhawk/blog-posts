<p>This is a sequel to Dick’s now-famous <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/WEB2_2005/">Identity
2.0</a> talk. He’s definitely
had an influence on this crowd – the two speakers after Dick used a
similar presentation style. However, what I didn’t realize from watching
the Identity 2.0 talk is that it’s much more effective on video than in
the audience because he’s spending so much time looking at the screen
(though that may be an artifact of a new presentation).</p>
<p>The other thing about this talk is that it’s basically a product pitch
for <a href="http://www.sxip.com/sxip">SXIP 2.0</a>. That – for me anyway – was
much less interesting than the more conceptual Identity 2.0 talk.
However, I will be trying out the new SXIP stuff when I get back home
next week.</p>
