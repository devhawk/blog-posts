I’ve got over 500 unread news posts and 200 emails in my inbox to
process. So this is nowhere near comprehensive.

-   Clarius released the [June 07
    CTP](http://softwarefactoriestoolkit.net/Download_JUN07CTP.aspx) of
    their [Software Factory
    Toolkit](http://www.softwarefactoriestoolkit.net/). Big new feature
    in this drop is [T4 Text Template
    editor](http://www.softwarefactoriestoolkit.net/T4Editor_JUN07CTP.pdf.aspx)
    that has syntax highlighting and eventually intellisense. They also
    released the May 07 CTP of [VSSDK
    Assist](http://www.codeplex.com/vssdkassist), previously known as
    VSIP Factory. Haven’t played with either yet, but it seems like a
    good time to be a tool builder.
-   PowerShell hits [a million downloads in six
    months](http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2007/06/04/powershell-hits-a-million-downloads-in-the-first-six-months.aspx).
    No surprise there, IT’S FRAKING AWESOME. Jeff Snover details seven
    MSFT products using PS, promising many more that he can’t talk
    about. See earlier comment about being fraking awesome.
-   Speaking of PS, I don’t “get” [Server
    Core](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/servercore.mspx) because
    it doesn’t support managed code. So no PS for Server Core. They
    announced @ TechEd that Server Core will support IIS 7, but since
    there’s no CLR you can’t run ASP.NET. As far as I’m concerned, no PS
    and no ASP.NET is below the minimum threshold of usefulness. I
    realize it’s technical limitation related to the current factoring
    of the .NET Framework and I assume some team somewhere in Redmond is
    working on fixing it. But what’s the point of releasing Server Core
    in the meantime?
-   QUT releases version 0.8 of their [Ruby.NET
    compiler](http://plas2003.fit.qut.edu.au/Ruby.NET/). Given that the
    IronRuby guys
    [bootstrapped](http://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/ironruby_and_ru.html)
    by licensing the Ruby.NET compiler, I wonder how these two projects
    will evolve side by side.
-   Speaking of Ruby, [JRuby](http://jruby.codehaus.org/) has [gone
    1.0](http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2007/06/jruby-10.html). Congrats!
-   At TechEd, I saw my friend Steve Jones from Capgemini, and it’s not
    this [Steve
    Jones](http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/). Woops. But CRUD
    is still CRAP.
-   Pat Helland breaks Scott Hanselman’s [Rule
    \#2](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BlogInteresting32WaysToKeepYourBlogFromSucking.aspx)
    and details how he “[lost a
    Megan](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/06/10/tmi-a-saga-of-weight-loss-exercise-tummy-tucks-and-health.aspx)“.
-   My ex-teammate David Hill has been busy with
    [Acropolis](http://windowsclient.net/Acropolis/Default.aspx "Acropolis").
    If you are even the slightest bit interested in this technology, you
    should be reading [his blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/dphill/).
-   Microsoft acquired a company called
    [Stratature](http://www.stratature.com/) last week. I don’t
    typically track MSFT acquisition news + it was lost in the noise of
    TechEd. But Roger Wolter thinks it’s a [great
    move](http://blogs.msdn.com/rogerwolterblog/archive/2007/06/11/master-data-management-microsoft-and-stratature.aspx) and
    that Stratature’s Master Data Management hub product is one of the
    best. Given the importance of MDM in SOA, I think I need to go learn
    more about this product.
