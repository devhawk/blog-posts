<p>I’m settling in to my new job. One way to tell, read <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.msn.com/">Dale Churchward’s
blog</a>. Dale’s a teammate of mine. He
only joined Microsoft a few months ago. Apparently, he used to blog at
his old job, but either way we’ve now doubled the number of bloggers on
my new team, with hopefully more to follow.</p>
<p>In addition to his opinions of <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.msn.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!113.entry">political
discource</a>
and the <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.msn.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!121.entry">Seahawks
chances</a>
next season, Dale’s got some interesting posts on <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.msn.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!127.entry">data
integration</a>
and <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.msn.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!129.entry">system
diagrams</a>.
Check it out.</p>
