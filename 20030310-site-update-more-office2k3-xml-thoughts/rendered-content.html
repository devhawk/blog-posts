<p>Kudos to Scott W &amp; TripleASP.NET’s <a href="http://tripleasp.net/showcode.aspx">Show My
Code</a> tool. I updated the source
code to my articles so the sample code would be syntax color coded. I
like it. Not 100% satisfied w/ the output – I did hand tool the results
a bit. Maybe there could be an option to spit out an XML adorned version
of the source code? Then I could put the &lt;br&gt; tags exactly where I
wanted them via an XSLT.</p>
<p>Speaking of XSLT, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/frontpage/default.asp">FrontPage
2003</a> is
supposed to have an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/developer/downloads/OfficeSystemAndXML.doc">XSLT graphical
editor</a>.
But from some basic looking around, it appears that it only works in
conjunction a
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/preview/default.asp">SharePoint</a>
based site. Too bad, I was hoping it would compete with
<a href="http://www.xmlspy.com">Altova’s</a><a href="http://www.xmlspy.com/products_xsl.html">Stylevision graphical XSLT
editor</a>. Given the relatively
high bar for XSLT development, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/default.asp">Office
2003′s</a> support of
XML in general and XSL in particular, I thought that FrontPage might
naturally evolve into an XSLT tool.</p>
<p>Anyone know where WordML schema is documented?</p>
