[Sound of light saber being activated] I will lop off the fingers of the first one of you who DARES to even THINK of deprecating Camel and Pascal casing in .NET code!  \n\nYou freaks who want to code with underscores in Ruby, I hope you, too, get run out of town on a Rail!  GRRRRRR!\n\n(No, seriously, underscores are the spawn of Satan).\n\nHave a nice day!  :)"

On my team, the old timers are in the habit of setting local references to Nothing when using VB.NET. Ie,\n\nPublic Sub Foo()\n  Dim x As New Object\n  ' Use x\n  x = Nothing\nEnd Sub\n\nNobody can explain how this got started and I've had some extreme difficulty explaining this is not necessary."
