I’m sitting in the [PyCon
keynote](http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/keynotes/) right now, but I
wanted to take a quick second to say congrats to my new teammates for
getting the brand spanking new [beta 1
drop](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=10266)
of IronPython 2.0. You can find out what’s new via the [release
notes](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Wiki/View.aspx?title=v2.0%20Beta%201%20Release%20Notes&referringTitle=Home).
