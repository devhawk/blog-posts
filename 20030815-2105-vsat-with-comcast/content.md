I just got a phone call from my high-speed internet provider
[Comcast](http://comcast.net/comcast.html). It was an automated message,
which I typically have little patience for. However, this message
directed me to a [page on their
site](http://online.comcast.net/help/faq-detail.asp?intFaqID=334) that
explains how to deal with MSBlast, including links to [the
patch](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-026.asp)
and [Symantec’s fix
tool](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/FixBlast.exe).
Between this and their [adoption of the MS TV
software](http://www.microsoft.com/tv/MSTVComcastpr.mspx), I think it’s
safe to say I’m very satisfied with their service.
