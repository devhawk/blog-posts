There’s a new version of WL Writer, so I spent a little time updating my
Gamer Card Writer Plugin. The big addition in this version is support
for the different card styles from
[MyGamerCard.net](http://mygamercard.net/). Also, I added a preview, so
you can see what the card will look like before you insert it into your
post.

Rather than post it here, I submitted it to the [Windows Live
Gallery](http://gallery.live.com/), since they’ve added an area for
[Writer Plugins](http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?l=8). You can
[download](http://gallery.live.com/liveitemdetail.aspx?li=0dfb3c1d-bb4e-4661-ad80-82c1994b424e&l=8)
it from there.
