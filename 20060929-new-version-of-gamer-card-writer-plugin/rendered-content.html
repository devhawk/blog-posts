<p>There’s a new version of WL Writer, so I spent a little time updating my
Gamer Card Writer Plugin. The big addition in this version is support
for the different card styles from
<a href="http://mygamercard.net/">MyGamerCard.net</a>. Also, I added a preview, so
you can see what the card will look like before you insert it into your
post.</p>
<p>Rather than post it here, I submitted it to the <a href="http://gallery.live.com/">Windows Live
Gallery</a>, since they’ve added an area for
<a href="http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?l=8">Writer Plugins</a>. You can
<a href="http://gallery.live.com/liveitemdetail.aspx?li=0dfb3c1d-bb4e-4661-ad80-82c1994b424e&amp;l=8">download</a>
it from there.</p>
