<p>After introducing myself at a customer meeting today in Phoenix, someone
asked “Are you the Harry Pierson from DevHawk?”. First time that’s
happened – kinda cool. Nice that he recognized my real name – I think
most people who read this blog just know me as “DevHawk”. A couple of
times, I’ve introduced myself to blank stares then mention that I write
DevHawk to instant recognititon.</p>
<p>BTW, I did take the
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/mgudgin/default.aspx">plunge</a> and put the
URL for my blog on my business cards.</p>
