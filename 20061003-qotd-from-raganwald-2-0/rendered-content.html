<p>Saw these on <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Reg Braithwaite’s</a> while I
was reading that <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/09/wasabi-cannot-cure-rotten-fish.html">Wasabi cannot cure rotten
fish</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people to collect wood and
don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for
the endless immensity of the sea.”<br />
<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/a/antoine_de_saintexupery.html">Antoine de
Saint-Exupery</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And my new personal personal favorite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any
good, you’ll have to ram them down people’s throats.”<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Aiken">Howard Aitken</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like that quote so much, I updated my email signature to include it.</p>
