<p>Three new application blocks are up on MSDN: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/ServiceAgg.asp">Service
Aggregation</a>,
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/PAIBlock.asp">Asynchronous
Invocation</a>
and
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/CachingBlock.asp">Caching</a>.
There’s also a great new guide on ASP.NET security: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnnetsec/html/ThreatCounter.asp">Improving Web
Application Security: Threats and
Countermeasures</a>.
These are both part of the overall <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/">patterns &amp;
practices</a> guidance that
Microsoft is publishing. However, the P&amp;P site moved recently and
doesn’t seem to have any of these new publications listed yet, though
some are listed on the “<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/coming.asp">Coming
Soon</a>” page.</p>
