As if the [VS.NET PowerToys](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/ide) weren’t
cool enough, now you can join [GotDotNet
communities](http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/messageboard/Thread.aspx?id=107870)
and help contribute to their development. Actually, I should say “will
be able to help contribute” as all the links the the specific
communities are not working yet.

As a bonus, you can get (will be able to get) access to an alpha build
of the VSCMDShell Window PowerToy.
