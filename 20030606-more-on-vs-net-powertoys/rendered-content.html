<p>As if the <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/ide">VS.NET PowerToys</a> weren’t
cool enough, now you can join <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/messageboard/Thread.aspx?id=107870">GotDotNet
communities</a>
and help contribute to their development. Actually, I should say “will
be able to help contribute” as all the links the the specific
communities are not working yet.</p>
<p>As a bonus, you can get (will be able to get) access to an alpha build
of the VSCMDShell Window PowerToy.</p>
