    "content": "You may want to listen to the latest Herding Code episode interviewing DotNetNuke co-founder Joe Brinkman (http://herdingcode.com/?p=183). Even though the main topic is about webforms vs asp.net mvc. Towards the end of the show, he did address his experiences and thoughts on maintaining a large-scale open source project.\n\nTo summarize his ideas around the issues of accepting community contributions in large scale open source projects backed by commercial companies:\n\n* Community contributions are generally welcomed, or even begged, when a project is small.\n* When project grows bigger, the cost and risk of accepting community contributions become prohibitively high.\n* A community contributor usually doesn't have the big picture of the project in mind when he/she contributes his/her patches.\n\nThis is really a poor summary (mainly due to my broken English) of the things discussed in the show. So be sure to listen to the original podcast.\n\nTo make your presentation more interesting than political rallies, I believe it will do more impact if you could focus the presentation on proposing some constructive resolutions to the many known hurdles a commercial company backed open source project faces in accepting community contributions. After all, the Internet doesn't lack blank arguments of urging Microsoft to be more open.",

    "content": "This is not a time to be elegant with words. Push it to them VERY hard. Either Microsft stops being an island, or lose developers to open source, probably forever. It's just that simple. The steps they have taken to date may seem like a big deal to Microsoft, but it's no more a bigger-deal than spitting in the ocean. The entire massive growth of the Internet is due to community involvement, not a single company. \n\nMicrosoft has defined open source as its enemy. Everybody feels that. Balmer projects that often. So even though high-profile MVC is released, developers know deep down that there's not one ounce of \"corporate\" passion behind those bits. Let them know that we know that. Let them know we are looking at open source stacks right now. ",

    "content": "After 30 years of profit, making (at one point) Bill Gates not only the richest man in America, but also personally owning 40% of the US GDP.  I'd say it's time to give back in a big, big way.  Not to the stockholders.  It's time to go back to grassroots, streamlined, security-minded coding--pure interoperability--where the focus is not on how much profit can be milked out of a proprietary sale of a technology solution, but rather everyone on the same page and working together to solve the issues that IT faces today.  No arguments; a good product will make the developer profit from his hard work.  It's time to take the venom out of the proprietary code and ensure that all pieces of code written work seamlessly on all platforms.  The days of narrow-minded, one-dimensional operating system software should have already been behind us as an IT community. Let's embrace the opportunities we have to collaborate and make software work for our nations, our states, and our cities.  The future has been now for over a decade and a half, and yet another development of a new OS is a tired idea.  Let's improve the ones we have, all work to make our days go by better, and a sense of pride and honor and integrity will increase the morale of the IT community at-large.  \n\nKG\nNetwork Security Research Analyst\nInfination Technology Research\nkevin@infination.com\n662.497.2890\nhttp://infination.info/contacts",
