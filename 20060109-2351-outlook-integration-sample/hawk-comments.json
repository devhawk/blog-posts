    "content": "I am curious about the explorer_close and inspector_close events.  I have noticed that the code throws all sorts of \"first chance exceptions\" during runtime and shutdown.  The problem I see is that there is no way to integrate custom images or position information(loaded at instantiation,saved at shutdown).  The concept is very good, but I think it needs more tweaking to become a true Utility class.\n\nStill it is a very good piece of work, and an awesome accelerator for Outlook Smart Client creation.",
