<p>I’ve been using SharpReader all day – like everyone else. I love it, but
I do have a couple of feature requests. I love the folder view – click
on “subscribed feeds” and it shows every entry in every blog you’re
subscribed to. However, since not everyone uses the same format for
dates, the “sort by date” feature doesn’t always bring the unread
entries to the top. Can we get a “only show unread” filter? And I’d like
a simple method to skip to the next unread entry (Syndirella uses the
space bar for this).</p>
<p>I see <a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/">Luke</a> has
<a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/07.html#000057">resurfaced</a>
after going dark for 24 hours straight. I wonder if he was handling
feature requests?</p>
