<p>Jules and I voted this morning, before work and school. Patrick helped
Julie vote and Riley helped me vote. I‚Äôm assuming regular readers don‚Äôt
need to be told <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">who I voted for</a>. Riley
just wanted to help fill in the bubbles because it‚Äôs like coloring.
Patrick kinda got what was going on ‚Äì check out <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!2911.entry">Jules‚Äô

about how they cast ‚Äúour‚Äù vote.</p>
<p>For shits and giggles, I went back and looked at my posts <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/11/07/certainly-not-politics-as-usual/">from two
years
ago</a>.
It doesn‚Äôt make me Nostradamus, but I did guess we were going to have ‚Äúa
very ugly race, especially from the Republicans‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe
nomination race will be worse‚Äù than the general election. If <a href="http://countdown.msnbc.com">Keith
Olbermann</a> or <a href="http://rachel.msnbc.com/">Rachel
Maddow</a> want to get in on this insightful
political analysis, they know where to reach me.

<p>I‚Äôve been obsessed with three polling sites over the past few months:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight.com</a> which is
projecting 6.1 point popular vote / 159.2 electoral vote Obama
victory</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pollster.com/" title="http://www.pollster.com/">Pollster.com</a>
which is projecting a <a href="http://www.pollster.com/polls/us/08-us-pres-ge-mvo.php?xml=/flashcharts/content/xml/08USPresGEMvO.xml&amp;choices=Obama,McCain&amp;phone=&amp;ivr=&amp;internet=&amp;mail=&amp;smoothing=&amp;from_date=&amp;to_date=&amp;min_pct=&amp;max_pct=&amp;grid=&amp;points=&amp;trends=&amp;lines=">7.6
point</a>
PV / 149 EV Obama victory (with 105 toss-up EVs)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/">Real Clear Politics</a> is
projecting a <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/general_election_mccain_vs_obama-225.html">7.5
point</a>
PV / <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/?map=10">138
EV</a>
Obama victory</li>
</ul>
<p>My wingnut libertarian friend (anyone from my kids‚Äô playgroup who reads
this blog can guess who I‚Äôm talking about) thinks McCain will win with
‚Äú295-305‚Äù electoral votes. This election is far from being in the bag
for Obama, but the suggestion that McCain will come from six or seven
points down in the polls to win a 10-20 point bigger EV victory than
Bush did four years ago seems like crazy talk. As for me, I‚Äôm not
willing to make a firm prediction except to say that I think the polls
are wrong ‚Äì I‚Äôm just not sure in what direction they‚Äôre wrong.</p>
<p>On the one hand, if the polls are underestimating Obama‚Äôs support by
excluding cell-phone only voters and Obama‚Äôs Get Out The Vote effort is
as strong as it looks, that could net Obama as much as five or six
points on top of the lead he‚Äôs already got and we‚Äôll be looking at an
epic landslide with Obama maybe brushing up against 400 EV. For example,
Pollster.com‚Äôs 291 solid/lean Obama EV + 105 toss up EVs would be 396
total EVs for Obama.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the polls are overestimating Obama‚Äôs support due
to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect">Bradley Effect</a>,
the undecideds break for decisively for McCain and Obama‚Äôs GOTV effort
doesn‚Äôt materialize, McCain‚Äôs might net those five or six points and
turn this into a toss-up squeaker decided by less than 35 EV (about the
size of Bush‚Äôs victory in 2004). For example, if McCain wins all of
Pollster.com‚Äôs tossups + the lean Obama states, it‚Äôs a scant 8 EV Obama
victory (273-265). If McCain could also pick off any of New Mexico,
Colorado, Iowa or Pennsylvania in that scenario, then he would win by
anywhere from 2-34 EVs.</p>
<p>Of course, those effects could cancel out and leave us where we are
right now, Obama with a six to seven point PV and low 100s EV victory.
Frankly, I‚Äôll be happy to be wrong about the poll inaccuracy since that
would give Obama the presidency.</p>
<p>How do you think things are going to play out today?</p>
