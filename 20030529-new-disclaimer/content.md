Observant readers who view my site in HTML rather than just reading the
RSS feed may have noticed I’ve added a
[disclaimer](default.aspx#disclaimer) to my site. What a coincidence,
it’s very similar to the disclaimer other Microsoft employees use when
they post on [newsgroups](http://msdn.microsoft.com/newsgroups/).
