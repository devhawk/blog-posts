<p>Observant readers who view my site in HTML rather than just reading the
RSS feed may have noticed I’ve added a
<a href="default.aspx#disclaimer">disclaimer</a> to my site. What a coincidence,
it’s very similar to the disclaimer other Microsoft employees use when
they post on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/newsgroups/">newsgroups</a>.</p>
