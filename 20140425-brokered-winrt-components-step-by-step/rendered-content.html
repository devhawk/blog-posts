<p>Based on the feedback I’ve gotten since my <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/KEY01#time=1h35m39s">keynote appearance @
Build</a> –
both in person and via email &amp; twitter – there are a lot of folks who
are excited about the Brokered WinRT Component feature. However, I’ve
been advising folks to hold off a bit until the new VS templates were
ready. Frankly, the developer experience for this feature is a bit rough
and the VS template makes the experience much better. Well, hold off no
longer! My old team has published the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/527286e4-b06a-4234-adde-d313c9c3c23e">Brokered WinRT Component Project
Templates</a>
up on the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio
Gallery</a>!</p>
<p>Now that the template is available, I’ve written a step-by-step guide
demonstrating how to build a “Hello World” style brokered component.
Hopefully, this will help folks in the community take advantage of this
cool new feature in Windows 8.1 Update.</p>
<p>To keep it readable, I’ve broken it into three separate posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://devhawk.net/2014/04/25/brokered-winrt-components-step-one">Step One – Build the brokered WinRT
component</a></li>
<li><a href="http://devhawk.net/2014/04/25/brokered-winrt-components-step-two">Step Two – Build the
proxy/stub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://devhawk.net/2014/04/25/brokered-winrt-components-step-three">Step Three – Build the client WinRT
app</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note, this walkthrough assumes you’re running Windows 8.1 Update, Visual
Studio 2013 with <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/2014-apr-2-vs#VS2013Update2RC">Update 2
RC</a>
(or later) and the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/527286e4-b06a-4234-adde-d313c9c3c23e">Brokered WinRT Component Project
Templates</a>
installed.</p>
<p>I hope this series helps you take advantage of brokered WinRT
components. If you have any further questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:harry.pierson@microsoft.com">drop me an
