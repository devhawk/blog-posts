Based on the feedback I’ve gotten since my [keynote appearance @
Build](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/KEY01#time=1h35m39s) –
both in person and via email & twitter – there are a lot of folks who
are excited about the Brokered WinRT Component feature. However, I’ve
been advising folks to hold off a bit until the new VS templates were
ready. Frankly, the developer experience for this feature is a bit rough
and the VS template makes the experience much better. Well, hold off no
longer! My old team has published the [Brokered WinRT Component Project
Templates](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/527286e4-b06a-4234-adde-d313c9c3c23e)
up on the [Visual Studio
Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/)!

Now that the template is available, I’ve written a step-by-step guide
demonstrating how to build a “Hello World” style brokered component.
Hopefully, this will help folks in the community take advantage of this
cool new feature in Windows 8.1 Update.

To keep it readable, I’ve broken it into three separate posts:

-   [Step One – Build the brokered WinRT
    component](http://devhawk.net/2014/04/25/brokered-winrt-components-step-one)
-   [Step Two – Build the
    proxy/stub](http://devhawk.net/2014/04/25/brokered-winrt-components-step-two)
-   [Step Three – Build the client WinRT
    app](http://devhawk.net/2014/04/25/brokered-winrt-components-step-three)

Note, this walkthrough assumes you’re running Windows 8.1 Update, Visual
Studio 2013 with [Update 2
RC](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/2014-apr-2-vs#VS2013Update2RC)
(or later) and the [Brokered WinRT Component Project
Templates](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/527286e4-b06a-4234-adde-d313c9c3c23e)
installed.

I hope this series helps you take advantage of brokered WinRT
components. If you have any further questions, feel free to [drop me an
