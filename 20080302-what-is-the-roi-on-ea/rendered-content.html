<p>Nick Malik <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/02/27/morning-coffee-150/">took me to
task</a>
for my
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/02/27/morning-coffee-150/">suggestion</a> that
Enterprise Architecture provides no value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You implied that I could not answer the question, “How does EA
demonstrate value.” That is not true. I can readily answer the
question, from my viewpoint, but I chose instead to *ask* the
question to see if my answer matches the various answers that I may
hear back. I got a lot of valuable input, both on the blog and on the
forum on Shared Insights where I asked the same question.</p>
<p>You are the ONLY person to reply and say that EA provides no value.</p>
<p>Perhaps you should read about the role and value of Enterprise
Architecture from established sources before you bash the entire
profession.</p>
<p>EA is real, my friend. It is as real as city planning. The only major
city in the US without city planning is Houston. I have visited a few
times, and I can honestly say that without city planning, they are a
mess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nick also provided a link to an
<a href="http://www.architectureandgovernance.com/articles/12-evolving_role.asp">article</a>
in Architecture and Governance magazine. I was going to read it, however
their web site is down as I write this. I feel comfortable interpreting
that as a sign that I’m right…
😄</p>
<p>Actually, Nick’s got a point. It was wholly unfair of me to say that EA
provides no value. However, I do believe the return on investment of
enterprise architecture is fairly low, perhaps even negative. In other
words, I shouldn’t have argued that EA doesn’t deliver <em>any</em> value, but
instead that I don’t think it delivers <em>enough</em> value, given what we
spend on it.</p>
<p>Architecture ROI is hard enough to calculate on a project by project
basis. I would argue that measuring it at the EA level is probably
impossible, but I think that’s both a blessing and a curse. It’s a curse
because EA can’t justify their existence in terms the business can
understand. It’s a blessing because if EA is running as deep in the red
as I suspect they might be, the company would cut EA entirely in a
heartbeat.</p>
<p>Since Nick started my asking a question about value, let me turn it
around and ask some questions of my own:</p>
<ol>
<li>How much do you think your organization spends on EA per year?</li>
<li>What do you think your organization’s EA ROI is?</li>
<li>What can you do to improve your organization’s EA ROI?</li>
</ol>
