<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/03/09/391276.aspx">announced</a>
earlier today that the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=43636">March 05
CTP</a> build of the DSL
toolkit is now available. I’m installing it as I type. Well, not exactly
true – I’m installing VC++. This drop apparently requires it.</p>
