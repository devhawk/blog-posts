I was going to wait until tomorrow’s Morning Coffee to post about
[TechFest
2007](http://research.microsoft.com/news/featurestories/publish/TechFest_2007.aspx),
but I just realized that [Rick
Rashid’s](http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/presskit/rashid/)
keynote will be [webcast publicly
tomorrow](http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/) at 9:30 am Pacific
time. I don’t ever get my Morning Coffee post out that early, so I
figured I’d give my readers the heads up now.

From the [TechFest](http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/) website:

> Microsoft Research TechFest provides a strategic forum for Microsoft
> researchers to connect with the broader group of Microsoft employees
> and product managers. Hundreds of researchers from Microsoft’s
> worldwide labs in China, England, India and the US gather for the
> annual event at the company’s corporate headquarters in Redmond,
> Washington. They come together to exchange ideas with colleagues, show
> off their latest innovations, and shine a light into the future of
> computing. In many cases, the partnerships formed at TechFest between
> researchers and product teams allow innovations to begin making their
> way into game-changing products for Microsoft customers.

I’ve been to every TechFest so far, even the first one when I lived in
L.A. (got special permission my my manager to come up for it) and the
one where I was on paternity leave after Patrick was born (got special
permission from my wife to be leave her alone with a three week old).
This one is no different. In fact, I think my whole team is going up on
Wednesday.

Last week was been slow, but with GDC and TechFest I’m thinking this
week will be much more lively.
