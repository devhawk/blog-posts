<li>The MSDN folks have a utility for <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/packagethis">creating custom help
files</a> from the online MSDN
library. I didn’t realize MSDN even <em>had</em> a <a href="http://services.msdn.microsoft.com/ContentServices/ContentService.asmx">content
service</a>.
This is tres useful.</li>
<li>Jeff Atwood
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000848.html">explains</a>
how error-filled the web is and how error-tolerant modern web
browsers are. I’ve often argued that one of the keys to the rise of
Visual Basic was because it was tolerant of sloppiness. It’s hard to
argue with Jeff’s conclusion that “forgiveness by default is what
works”.</li>
<li><a href="http://labs.biztalk.net/">BizTalk Labs</a> shipped an update to the
<a href="http://connect.biztalk.net/">Connectivity Service</a>. It “now
supports simple publish and subscribe eventing. This allows
<em><strong>multiple clients</strong></em> to subscribe to a service and receive
notifications.” Steve Maine has <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,163e2844-bc01-4f6c-b721-d432666ec966.aspx">some
details</a>

about IronRuby, but was hoping to see a new Ruby/C# hybrid
language. Even though it’s his “#1 administrative programming
language”, he specifically hopes for a new language so would “have
the flexibility to evolve the language.” But Larry, MSFT already had
an dynamic administrative language that it can evolve! It’s called
PowerShell…</li>
<li>The XNA folks have shipped a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/04/26/content-update-for-creators-xna-com.aspx">bunch of new
content</a>,
including the <a href="http://www.xnaracinggame.com/">Racing Game Starter
Kit</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.machinima.com/">Machinima</a> is growing up fast. I just
discovered <a href="http://www.reallusion.com/iclone/">iClone</a>, a real-time
3D animation filmmaking tool. You know, my birthday is coming up
later this month…</li>
