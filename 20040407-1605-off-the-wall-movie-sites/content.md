Thanks to [Werner](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed)
for
[linking](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000430.html)
to the [Flick Filosopher](http://www.flickfilosopher.com/). I liked the
analysis of [The Passion of the
Christ](http://www.flickfilosopher.com/flickfilos/archive/2004/jesuschrist.shtml)
and the comparison Monty Python’s Life of Brian. I especially liked her
[Best & Worst Of
2003](http://www.flickfilosopher.com/flickfilos/articles/bestdesign2003.shtml)
article as well. An you have *got* to respect anyone who has “The
Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai: Across the Eighth Dimension” at the top
of their list of [100 comfort
movies](http://www.flickfilosopher.com/canon/index.shtml). Only downer –
no RSS feed. \<sigh\>

The other movie review site I read regularly is [Mr.
Cranky](http://www.mrcranky.com/). I’m a big fan of his unique comments
on bad movies such as ” I have never come closer to tearing my own penis
off and throwing it at the screen while watching a movie” ([Laura Croft
2](http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/tombraider2.html)) “Chris Klein is
like Keanu Reeves without any talent…Frankly, I have a hard time even
comprehending that sentence and its terrible implications.”
([Rollerball](http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/rollerball.html)) and “This
film caused the kind of pain I’d normally associate with being shot
through the thigh by a rusty nail from a high-powered nail gun” ([Saving
Silverman](http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/savingsilverman.html)). Again,
no RSS feed. \<double sigh\>
