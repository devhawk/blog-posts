It’s been pretty thin around here on posts. I’m at this big internal
MSFT conference this week and I was in Phoenix for work last week. So I
spent as much of the weekend away from the computer as possible. As for
the rest of this week, wireless access is pretty ubiquitous so I’ll post
when I can.

Here’s what else going on:

-   Got to hear [John Zachman](http://www.zifa.com) speak yesterday
    about his [enterprise architecture
    framework](http://www.zifa.com/framework.html). Pretty cool. I’m
    still digesting it, so more thoughts on this later.
-   I haven’t worked on [SharePoint
    Syndication](prj_sharepointsynd.aspx) at all since releasing v0.4.1.
    A few hearty souls have joined the workspace, but I haven’t even
    contacted them beyond admitting them as workspace members. I was
    thinking that for v0.5, the big feature would be to support some
    SharePoint Portal Server things for syndication (my site, best bets,
    searches, etc) but I haven’t even had time to get the B2TR version
    of SharePoint Portal installed.
-   I got the go-ahead from [Chris Sells](http://www.sellsbrothers.com)
    to host his [imcli](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#imcli)
    library as part of a [Messenger.NET](prj_messenger.aspx) GDN
    Workspace. Look for that soon.
