<p>It’s been pretty thin around here on posts. I’m at this big internal
MSFT conference this week and I was in Phoenix for work last week. So I
spent as much of the weekend away from the computer as possible. As for
the rest of this week, wireless access is pretty ubiquitous so I’ll post
when I can.</p>
<p>Here’s what else going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Got to hear <a href="http://www.zifa.com">John Zachman</a> speak yesterday
about his <a href="http://www.zifa.com/framework.html">enterprise architecture
framework</a>. Pretty cool. I’m
still digesting it, so more thoughts on this later.</li>
<li>I haven’t worked on <a href="prj_sharepointsynd.aspx">SharePoint
Syndication</a> at all since releasing v0.4.1.
A few hearty souls have joined the workspace, but I haven’t even
contacted them beyond admitting them as workspace members. I was
thinking that for v0.5, the big feature would be to support some
SharePoint Portal Server things for syndication (my site, best bets,
searches, etc) but I haven’t even had time to get the B2TR version
of SharePoint Portal installed.</li>
<li>I got the go-ahead from <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com">Chris Sells</a>
to host his <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#imcli">imcli</a>
library as part of a <a href="prj_messenger.aspx">Messenger.NET</a> GDN
Workspace. Look for that soon.</li>
</ul>
