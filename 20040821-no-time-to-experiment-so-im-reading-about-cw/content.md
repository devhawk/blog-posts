[COmega](http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/) (otherwise known as Cw
since most people don’t have an omega key on their keyboard) is on a
long list of stuff for me to look at. But instead of actually coding
with it, so far I can just read [Steve Maine’s
blog](http://hyperthink.net/blog/default.aspx). He’s got interesting
posts on
[syncronization](http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,9f8394a0-50df-4f7d-8a24-af2a69257728.aspx) and
[streams](http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,24c0d2b7-59f3-4c68-8f16-6b58877b2541.aspx),
the two big features of Cw over C\# (come to think of it, we use the
“\#” symbol as most people don’t have an actual sharp key on their
keyboard). I also learned from Steve that Cw comes with basic VS
integration – you get project support, syntax highlighting and some
Intellisense. Now I just need a few extra hours in the day.
