<p>From <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/jalexander/">John Alexander’s Blog</a>, I
found a link to an <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/158020_msftnotebook26.html">article in the Seattle
PI</a>
about <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> joining
Microsoft. The article focuses primarily on descibing wikis, but it does
mention he now works for PAG doing pattern work. I liked this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I write the seed of the idea and I come back in a week and see how
the idea has grown.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s also interesting to see that it took a month and a half for the
news to go from
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/12/11/pattern-master-microsoft/">blogs</a> to a
“mainstream” news source.</p>
