I haven’t installed it, buy Mike Tautly has written a [Bluetooth Remote
Control for
SmartPhone](http://mtaulty.com/blog/archive/2004/12/07/947.aspx). It’s a
managed app that uses Bluetooth to communitcate between a remote control
app running on the smartphone and a desktop app that can drive other
applications. Mike originally built it to drive PowerPoint from his
phone. I gotta try this – both my [MPx220
SmartPhone](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devices/devicedisplay.aspx?module=deviceDisplay;Smartphone;americas;134) and
[Toshiba Tecra M2
laptop](http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/cmod.to?seg=ENT&coid=-26376&sel=0&rcid=-26367&ccid=1291061)
support Bluetooth.
