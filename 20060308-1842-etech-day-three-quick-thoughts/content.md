After my marathon blogging session last night and taking notes all day,
I’m a bit burnt out on writing. But here are a few quick thoughts. More
details to follow.

-   I’m digging the [Live.com home page](http://www.live.com/) and the
    integrated Live Search. Since I’m on a rented laptop, [Live
    Toolbar](http://toolbar.live.com/) will have to wait. Coolest new
    feature IMO is the [Search
    Macros](http://microsoftgadgets.com/Macros), though it’s a tight
    race with the new image search interface.
-   Jon Udell and Michael Goldhaber spoke about attention economy today.
    I still don’t get it, though Jon had some interesting ideas about
    metadata. I’ll believe that attention is a currency when I can buy a
    car with it.
-   I liked the session on the [Yahoo! Design
    Patterns](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns), though the title
    and abstract of the session were awful. The title was “[The Language
    of Attention: A Pattern
    Approach](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8602)“.
    The inclusion of attention just confused the issue. Why couldn’t
    they just call it “A Pattern Language for User Experience”? Because
    it doesn’t have the concept of attention shoehorned into it.
-   I really like [Eventful](http://eventful.com/), even though I’m [on
    record](http://devhawk.net/2006/02/13/web-2-0-evolution/) as
    thinking their business model doesn’t work. Their new [demand
    feature](http://eventful.com/demand) is pretty cool, though it
    doesn’t really help their business model any.
-   George Dyson’s session on “[Turing’s
    Cathedral](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8035)”
    was fascinating, though he tried to cover too much ground in the
    time alloted.
-   I’m not sure what the point of Joel Spolsky’s [Blue Chip Report
    Card](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8323)
    was. Apparently the alien from [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com) is
    cute and Motorola newer cell phones (RAZR and PEBL) are taking
    Joel’s advice on becoming “blue chip”. This is somewhat related to
    points the folks from Adobe (previously Macromedia) made, except
    much more obtuse.
-   I have no idea what the point or business model of Plum is, even
    though it was
    [featured](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/9004)
    as a keynote (a last minute promotion it appears from the conference
    guide). Seems too complex and centralized to actually work.
-   I [wrote last
    night](http://devhawk.net/2006/03/07/felipe-cabrera-on-amazons-mechanical-turk/) that
    Casting Words isn’t really a business because nothing stops me from
    going directly to Mechanical Turk and getting the transcription
    services myself. Today, I found a Casting Words task on Mechanical
    Turk so I decided to figure out how much they’re making. The task I
    found was to transcribe about 28 minute podcast and they were
    offering \$5.41 for anyone willing to do it. That’s about 19.5 cents
    per minute. Tack on Amazon’s 10% charge brings the total to around
    21.5 cents a minute that Casting Words is paying for transcription
    services. Given that they’re charging 42 cents a minute, that’s just
    under a 49% profit margin. Exactly what are they doing to earn that
    profit? What’s their value add and is really worth a 100% markup?
-   Anyone want to start “Cheap Casting Words” with me? We’ll pay 22
    cents a minute (11% more than Casting Words) and charge 36 cents a
    minute (14% less than Casting Words) and keep the 12 cents a minute
    markup (a 33% markup).
    :smile:

Dyson, Joel Spolsky and Plum. Added more detail about the attention
economy sessions from today.
