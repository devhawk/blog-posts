The Caps and [their owner](http://ted.aol.com/) are aggressively pursing
avenues outside of the main stream media (which for the most part
ignores hockey). First, they come up with [Guidelines For Issuing Press
Credentials To
Bloggers](http://www.ericmcerlain.com/offwingopinion/archives/006447.php) and
now this.

Of all the major sports, hockey seems to have the most to gain from both
the HD revolution and media decentralization. Hockey is so fast and the
puck is so small, you spend most of your time tracking the puck when
watching in standard definition. In HD, you don’t have to watch the
puck, you can watch the play. This isn’t to say that other sports aren’t
gorgeous in HD, but the difference in the experience between SD and HD
just isn’t as significant for other sports. As for media
decentralization, the reason hockey has the most to gain is because it
has the least coverage in the mainstream media today. So there’s no
where to go but up.

However, the NHL broadcast restrictions stuff has got to go. Come on
[Ted](http://ted.aol.com/), you’re a “[pioneer of the Internet and new
media](http://www.corp.aol.com/whoweare/whoswho/leonsis.shtml)”. Get
those guys at the NHL to wake up and embrace the new media! How come
EVERY game isn’t available this way?
