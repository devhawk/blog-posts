<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://www.feedreader.com">FeedReader</a> for aggregating
news feeds, but I just downloaded and configured
<a href="http://www.syndirella.net/">Syndirella</a>. I think I’m going to switch
permanently since Syndirella handles some of the 2.0 RSS feeds that
FeedReader can’t. (I want to try <a href="http://www.rassoc.com/newsgator/">News
Gator</a>, but I’m not running a
compatible version of Outlook). Additionally, Syndirella is a .NET app,
which I like even if it has little bearing on the apps’ functionallity.</p>
