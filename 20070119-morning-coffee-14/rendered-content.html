<p>I just realized that I had Morning Coffee 9 both <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/12/late-morning-coffee-9/">last
Friday</a> and
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/15/morning-coffee-9/">last Monday</a>.
Woops. Rather than changing the titles of four posts, I’m just skipping
#13 instead. Just like a hotel.</p>
<ul>
<li>The folks behing the <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/">Optimus concept
keyboard</a> are
shipping a <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus-mini/">mini 3-key
keyboard</a>. The
basic idea of both keyboards is that the keyface is a little LED
screen. Apparently, they’re planning on releasing a production
version of the full keyboard <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/answers/">this
year</a>. The
3-key keyboard is
<a href="http://store.artlebedev.com/catalog/computer_add-ons/optimus-mini-three/">$160</a>,
so I’m guessing the full keyboard will cost quite a bit. (via <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OptimusMiniThreeKeyboardAndWindowsVistaSideShow.aspx">Scott

<li><a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200701/new_w3c_html_working_group_chaired_by_microsoft/">Some</a><a href="http://glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?2007/01/11/2420-future-of-the-html-wg-3">people</a>
are up in arms that the chair of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/11/HTML-WG-charter.html">new W3C HTML Working
Group</a> is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cwilso/archive/2007/01/10/you-me-and-the-w3c-aka-reinventing-html.aspx">Chris
Wilson from
Microsoft</a>.
I’m guessing these are people who don’t understand much about how
such working groups work. As Chris writes, most of his time as chair
will be herding cats. (via <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/">reddit</a>)</li>
<li>I am interested to see what this new working group produces. The #1
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/11/HTML-WG-charter.html#deliverables">deliverable</a> for
this group is “A language evolved from HTML4 for describing the
semantics of documents <strong>and applications</strong>on the World Wide Web”
(emphasis added). Given the already existing <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/webapi/">Web API
WG</a>, it would be nice to see an
application model as a formalized part of HTML.</li>
<li>Again <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImprovingOutlookTodayWithJelloDashboard.aspx">via
Scott</a>,
<a href="http://jello.wordpress.com/">Jello.Dashboard</a> is a replacement for
Outlook Today with a <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">GTD</a>
bent. However, as Scott points out, it is <em>slow</em>. Scott blames the
Outlook Automation APIs, but I think the scripting engine is also to
blame. In the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/01/09/outlook-integration-sample/">CRM Integration for
Outlook</a>
sample, I used a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479345.aspx#otlkcustinentapp_topic9">WinForms UserControl as a folder
homepage</a>
and didn’t notice any perf issues. If you expose a WinForms
UserControl as a COM control (via Guid and ComVisible attributes),
you can then host that control within an HTML file which is set as
the folder home page. The sample includes a helper function to
generate the HTML folder home page to host the UserControl. If
there’s interest, I can post a small sample. Not only is this
approach faster than a script based one, it’s easier to design and
debug.</li>
</ul>
