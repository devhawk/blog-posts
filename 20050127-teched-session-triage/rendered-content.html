<p>One of the reasons blogging has been a little light around here recently
is because I was prepping for the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2005/default.mspx">TechEd</a>
Session Triage. Basically, all the
<a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/tracks.aspx">track</a> owners figure out
what sessions they want on their own then come together for an entire
afternoon to present their sessions to each other. Turns out there is
often overlap with other sessions in other tracks that need to be worked
out, suggesting changes to titles and abstracts and other wise cutting
up. For example. I’m sitting next to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rdias">Becky</a> who owns the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rdias/archive/2004/12/07/278006.aspx">Connected Systems
Infrastructure</a>
track. We had several sessions in both the CSI and ARC tracks that have
caused changes and cuts. We actually got the ARC, CSI and DEV tracks got
together earlier this week for a “pre-iage” which means today went
pretty smooth for the ARC track. Not that it felt like things were going
to go smooth running around this morning. Typically, the last 24 hours
before triage are a flurry of emails with last minute suggestions. This
year – no exception. But now, at least it’s done.</p>
