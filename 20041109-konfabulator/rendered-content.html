<p>I just installed <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/">Konfabulator</a> as I’ve
seen several people, like
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/11/08.html#a8588">Scoble</a>,
blogging about it. I think I need to dig thru the widget gallery. Of the
preinstalled ones, I only like the Battery Level and WiFi Signal
widgets. But I <em>really</em> like them – as in like them enough to keep the
software installed just for them. I’ve only played with it for 5
minutes, but already I am not interested in any of the interactive
widgits – having a nice partially transparent graphic displaying
information at a glance works for me the best.</p>
<p>Esp. after the launch of Halo 2, I’d love to see a Konfabulator widget
with the status of my Xbox Live Friends list. Maybe something for the
<a href="http://www.xboxfriends.com/">XboxFriends</a> folks?</p>
<p>Speaking of Halo 2, I’m headed home now to do just that…</p>
