<p>Wow, I made it to ten of these morning coffee posts. That puts me only
two orders of magnitude behind <a href="http://www.larkware.com/">Mike</a> and one
order of magnitude behind
<a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/default.aspx">Sam</a>.</p>

<li>We got snow, again. My son apparently said the other day “OK God,
that’s enough snow now”. When a 3 year old is tired of snow, you
know you’ve gotten a lot.</li>
<li>Of course, people in snowier climates than here (the NorthEast,
Northen Midwest, pretty much all of Canada, etc) will snicker that 5
inches of snow is “a lot”.</li>
<li>I’m moving my STS code into a new VPC for handoff to the dev team. I
was running Virtual Server before, but for individual work like what
I do, Virtual PC is much easier to use. Drag and Drop into the VPC
alone is worth it to me to use Virtual PC instead of Virtual
Server. I am using the <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/programdetails.aspx?ProgramDetailsID=874">beta of Virual PC
2007</a>,
though I couldn’t tell you what the differences are.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fox.com/24/images/24_stephen_king.pdf">Steven King may
love</a> the new
season of 24, but I can’t shake the feeling of <a href="http://www.jumptheshark.com/">jumped
shark</a>. However, I am impressed that
Fox released the first 4 episodes of the new season
<a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/video/cl-fi-twentyfour16jan16,1,4590067.story?coll=cl-video">today</a>.</li>
<li>Two name changes later, the RTM version of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/compact/default.mspx">SQL <del>MobileAnywhere</del>
Compact
Edition</a>
is now available. BTW, I found <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevelasker/archive/2006/11/27/sql-server-compact-edition-under-asp-net-and-iis.aspx">this blog
post</a>
by Steve Lasker about using SQLce with ASP.NET. So it sounds doable,
though not recommend. Of course, for those of us using shared
hosting, SQLce is a non-starter until it becomes part of the
standard .NET framework install.</li>
</ul>
