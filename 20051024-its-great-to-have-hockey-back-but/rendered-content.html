<p>I’m glad the <a href="http://www.nhl.com/">NHL</a> is back. I’m glad that I get to
watch <a href="http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/1377/?tf=NHLArticleWrapper.tpl">some games in
HD</a>.
But it’s more than a little disconcerting to see commercials for hunting
shows and other so called “<a href="http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/961/?tf=nwArticle.tpl">field
sports</a>”
during breaks in the action.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that having the NHL on the same station as “<a href="http://oln.dayport.com/nw/article/view/1346/?UserDef=true&amp;catID=78">Wanted: Ted or
Alive</a>”
is really helping the sports image.</p>
