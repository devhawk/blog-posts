While I was in the far east last week, the [Architecture and Design
Events](http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/events/default.aspx)
page of [Architecture
Center](http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/architecture) got updated. Thanks
go to Lawrence, Richard and Mark – Architecture Center’s own three
amigos if you will. Looks like the Software Factories guys are going to
very busy, most of the upcoming events feature some type of presentation
on factories, models or domain specific languages.

What’s cool about this list is that it features MS events like TechEd
and PDC as well as non-MS events like OOPSLA, UML Conference and OOP.
The only bad thing about this list is that I’d like it to be longer.
Should there be more architecture-centric events or more architecture
content at developer-centric events on this list?
