<p>I am sick and tired of the warning dialog box for the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/7/0/4703eba2-78c4-4b09-8912-69f6c38d3a56/linq%20preview.msi">C# 3.0
preview</a>.
Every time you launch VS it pops up a dialog reading “This is an
unsupported version of Microsoft Visual C# 3.0. As such many features
may not work as expected.” You know, this isn’t my first time working
with alpha or beta quality software. I’m also running <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/downloads/getthebeta/default.aspx">WinFX Feb
CTP</a>,
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/3/1/b3141ee3-4a13-4061-a96e-4ae3c37ea0e0/LINQ%20VB%20Preview%20(Jan%202006).msi">VB 9.0 Jan
CTP</a>
and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/interactive_designer/id_free_trial.aspx">Expression Interactive Designer March
CTP</a>.
None of them feel the need to constantly remind me that they’re
unsupported.</p>
<p>Who suddenly thought C# developers need hand holding?</p>
