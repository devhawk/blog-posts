<li>I was checking out the <a href="http://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET community
site</a>, and I noticed a small “Microsoft
Communities” toolbar across the top. There’s a little menu that
links to other MS community sites like <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel
9</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/">MSDN
Blogs</a>. I’m surprised the <a href="http://www.netfx3.com/">NetFx3 community
site</a> isn’t included.</li>
<li>My teammate Dale is blogging about Proper SOA. He lays out <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!309.entry">6 Proper
SOA
principles</a>,
and then drills into the first three: <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!311.entry">meets business
needs</a>,
<a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!312.entry">requires
governance</a>
and <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!313.entry">responds to changing business
drivers</a>.
I expect to see posts on the remaining principles this week. Maybe
Dale should turn this series into an article.</li>
<li>Speaking of articles about architecture, Architecture Journal 10 is
<a href="http://www.msarchitecturejournal.com/pdf/Journal10.pdf">online as a

issue’s topic is Composite Applications.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge_programming_language">Malbolge</a>
is a programming lanugage that is “specifically designed to be
difficult to program in.” Here’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world">Hello
World</a> in Malbolge:<br />

Seriously. Actually, it’s worse than it looks. The effect of any
instruction depends on where it is located in memory.  Malbolge is
so difficult, it took <a href="http://www.acooke.org/andrew/writing/malbolge.html">a month to write a Lisp
program</a> to
generate that program. However, Lou Scheffer thinks we should think
about Malbolge as a
<a href="http://www.lscheffer.com/malbolge.shtml">cryptosystem</a>. I wonder if
it could be used for obfuscation? (via <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/01/hellish_programming_malbolge.php">Good Math, Bad

<li>Nat Torkington blogs about <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/01/why_johnny_cant.html">teaching kids to
program</a>.
He makes the point about “them to think in terms of small steps”. I
was lucky to have a computer teacher in elementary school who did
something similar. She had us write down instructions for making a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich and she then followed them to the
letter. For example, if you wrote, “spread peanut butter on the
bread” with out first instructing her to take out a slice, she’d
happily spread peanut butter on the entire loaf. (via
<a href="http://programming.reddit.com/">reddit</a>)</li>
<li>To this day, my wife thinks the peanut butter and jelly lesson
negatively affected my ability to communicate with “normal” people.
She’ll even say “peanut butter and jelly” when she thinks I’m being
particularly obtuse in my communication.</li>
