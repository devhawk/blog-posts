I did say I was going to go dark for a while. Of course, I wasn’t
expecting to burn my hand on the BBQ grill, get a toothache or for my
son to come down with what might be Whooping Cough.

One of the things I’ve been up to is updating my blog software. Well,
not as much updating as migrating to [DasBlog](http://dasblog.net). I’ve
made a bunch of changes to support my current functionality as well as
my look and feel. I’ve even built a CDF feed for DasBlog. Clemens [wants
one](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=cbc434d4-535b-464c-885e-6d81296449d7).
DevHawk currently [has one](cdf.aspx). I’m still trying to figure out
how to do my projects and articles sections. It does mean that many of
my existing links will break, but I am working on path rewrites to
minimize the hassle.

While I’ll be using DasBlog on my personal blog, I’ll also be working
with [ScottW](http://scottwater.com/blog/) on
[.Text](http://scottwater.com/dottext/). DasBlog rocks as a single user
blog, but .Text is a great engine for a hosted weblog community.
