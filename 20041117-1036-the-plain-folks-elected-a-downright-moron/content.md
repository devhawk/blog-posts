I’ve gotten very familiar with the [Urban Legend Reference
Pages](http://www.snopes.com/snopes.asp). I often get emails from close
friends or family of supposed news stories and quotes that a quick
search on the site demonstrate are false. Today, I hit one of the rarer
“true” pages on the site. I received a quote in email by [H. L.
Mencken](http://www.pratt.lib.md.us/slrc/hum/mencken.html) that has
apparently been making the rounds on the political blogs that I am not
currently reading due to my personal media blackout. The quote making
the rounds is:

> As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more
> and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and
> glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s
> desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downright
> moron

Mencken actually did say this, though the above quote is cut down and
taken slightly out of context. Here’s a larger version of the quote:

> The larger the mob, the harder the test. In small areas, before small
> electorates, a first-rate man occasionally fights his way through,
> carrying even the mob with him by force of his personality. But when
> the field is nationwide, and the fight must be waged chiefly at second
> and third hand, and the force of personality cannot so readily make
> itself felt, then all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically,
> the most devious and mediocre — the man who can most easily adeptly
> disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum.
>
> The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is
> perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner
> soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and
> glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s
> desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright
> moron.

I like the longer version much better. The cutdown quote reads like an
indictment of “the plain folks of the land”. The longer quote is more a
cynical commentary on the process itself. He still predicts (accurately
IMO) the election of a moron to the White House, but Mencken seems to
lay the blame more on having to campaign “second and third hand” than on
the people who elect said moron. Either way, you still have a moron, but
the longer quote gives much more insight on how to deal with the issue
going forward.

 I wonder what Mencklen would have thought of the modern media?
