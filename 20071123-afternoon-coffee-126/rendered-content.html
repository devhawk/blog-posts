<li>In a surprise to exactly nobody, the Caps <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3123386">let coach Glen Hanlon
go</a> yesterday.
I gotta say I feel for the guy. I mean, he had to go, but still. The
Caps promoted the coach of their minor league team Bruce Boudreau.
Makes sense – the farm team is where you develop players, why not
coaches too? The team responded by beating the Flyers in overtime,
though they did blow a 3 goal lead along the way.</li>
<li>It won’t get them back in the national title hunt, but <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273260009">thrashing
ASU</a> may earn
USC a ticket to a BCS bowl, or the Rose Bowl if the Ducks can’t win
without Dennis Dixon.</li>
<li>I finally finished <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/deadrising">Dead
Rising</a> today. A sequel has
been
<a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/04/capcom_dead_ris.html">rumored</a>
and <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=71678">hinted
at</a>, but <a href="http://www.xboxic.com/news/3327">not
confirmed</a> even though the ending
left the door wide open. I really enjoyed it, so here’s hoping. I’m
going to hold off on starting anything new until I get back from
Canada, but it’ll probably be
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/tomclancyrainbowsixvegas/">R6:Vegas</a>.
Don’t really have time between now and Christmas to finish <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bluedragonxbox360/">Blue
Dragon</a> and it’s 3
DVDs.</li>
<li>In more “Screw Turkey Day, we’re shipping anyway” news, p&amp;p shipped
a new version of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb931187.aspx">Web Service Software
Factory</a>.
This one’s called the “Modeling Edition”. I saw some of this stuff
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/08/01/service-factory-customization-workshop-day-two/">back in
August</a>,
and I like what those p&amp;p folks are doing. It’s worth a look, just
to see how they’ve integrated DSL and GAT.</li>
<li>My old team shipped a <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/LitwareHR/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8439">new
version</a>
of their S+S demo app LitwareHR. There’s also some
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/LitwareHR/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8440">tools</a>
for testing multi-tenant databases.</li>
<li>Quick reminder: I’m @ <a href="http://www.devteach.com/">DevTeach</a> Vancouver
next week, so blogging will be light. I’ve got a series of thoughts
on F# ready to post, but we’ll see when I get network access to
post them. Given that I took a month off from blogging a short while
back, I didn’t bother asking
<a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/">Dale</a> to cover for me.</li>
