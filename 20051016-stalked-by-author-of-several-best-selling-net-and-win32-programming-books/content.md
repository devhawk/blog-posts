First it was at [Fred Meyer](http://www.fredmeyer.com/) a week or two
ago. Next it was at my [favorite teriyaki
resturant](http://sapporoteriyaki.com/) last Thursday. Then this past
weekend, it happened again at [Remlinger
Farms](http://remlingerfarms.com/). I think [Jeff
Richter](http://www.wintellect.com/about/instructors/instructorbios.aspx?id=3)
is stalking me.
