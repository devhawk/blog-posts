<p>I got my blogging front end – built on Front Page – moved over to my new
tablet. I wrote at least part of this entry in ink. I was surprised to
discover that Office 2003 does not include the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=4922060F-002A-4F5B-AF74-978F2CD6C798&amp;displaylang=en">Office Web Services
Toolkit</a>
functionality, so I had to install that separately. While I was at it, I
downloaded the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9e0b1b7c-4ab5-40d2-b4d9-5817ab0bc1e5&amp;DisplayLang=en">VS.NET Tools for
Office</a>.
I was thinking of writing a C# based blogging front end that used Word
instead of Front Page or InfoPath since only Word supports the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/tsf/">Text
Services
Framework</a>.
This means that if the tablet mis-recognizes your handwriting, you can
choose alternative recognition options instead of deleting and rewriting
the word. For pen based input (with my crappy handwriting) this is a
huge time saver.</p>
