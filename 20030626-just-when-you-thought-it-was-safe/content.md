The prescriptive guidance is coming fast and furious now. The [User
Interface Process Application
Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/uip.asp) is a
framework for abstracting the control flow and state management out of
the user interface layer. The [Configuration Management Application
Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/cmab.asp) is a
solution to manage configuration data across your applications. And the
[Updater Application
Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/updater.asp)
provides a mechanism to build the ability to update directly into your
application.

Also, from ScottW, I discovered that the [Data Access Application Block
v2](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=c20d12b0-af52-402b-9b7c-aaeb21d1f431)
[shipped last Friday](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/viewUploads.aspx?id=c20d12b0-af52-402b-9b7c-aaeb21d1f431).
Hasnâ€™t shown up on [MSDN
yet](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/daab-rm.asp).
