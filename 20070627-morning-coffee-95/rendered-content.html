<li><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DasBlog197ReleaseFinalASPNET11Version.aspx">New version of
dasBlog</a>
is out, the final version on ASP.NET 1.1 (unless this release “kills
a kitten” as per Scott Hanselman). I don’t have the time (make the
time?) to run daily builds, but I do try and upgrade to new major
releases in a timely fashion. I’m also moving hosters, so expect a
little downtime around here at some point in the near future.</li>
<li>Matt Winkler is doing a series on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle/archive/2007/05/24/different-execution-patterns-with-wf-or-going-beyond-sequential-and-state-machine.aspx">alternate WF execution
patterns</a>.
His first is the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle/archive/2007/06/27/implementing-the-n-of-m-pattern-in-wf.aspx">N of M
pattern</a>.
While I can <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/10/17/wf-clarifications-and-corrections/">nitpick some
things</a>
in WF – especially the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/12/11/transactions-in-workflow-foundation-land/">limitations of transaction
flow</a>
– WF’s support for variability and extensibility of execution
patterns is fraking brilliant. (via <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/06/27/new-and-notable-175.aspx">Sam

<li>Joe McKendrick is all excited about a <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=904">SOA built without web
services</a>! We’ve
been “doing SOA” since the EDI days without web services, so I’m not
sure this level of excitement – with an exclamation point and
everything – is warranted. But it is good to see people realize web
services != SOA. Instead of web services, <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1261398,00.html">CERN is using
JMS</a>
to move messages around. I don’t know much about
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/overview.html">JMS</a>, but I do know
it supports async and durable messaging, two things I think are
critical for enterprise services.</li>
<li>I <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2312">saw on LtU</a> that
there’s a <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/publications/OSR2007_RethinkingSoftwareStack.pdf">new
paper</a>
on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/">Singularity</a> out.
For those who don’t know, Singularity is a MS Research platform
designed for reliability instead of performance. But there’s more
than just a new paper. According to the project <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/os/singularity/">home
page</a>, “Singularity
Version 1.0 is complete. We’ve shipped the Singularity Research
Development Kit (RDK) to a small number of universities for their
research efforts.” I wonder if I can get my hands on that RDK?</li>
<li>Jeff Atwood is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000893.html">starting to show
ads</a> on
Coding Horror, but he’s donating “a significant percentage” of the
ad revenue back into the programming community. He’s starting with
$5,000 and Microsoft is matching for a total of $10,000 to be
donated to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000894.html">open source .NET
projects</a>.

<li>On Monday, Nick Malik
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/23/simple-lifecycle-agility-maturity-model.aspx">posted</a>
what he called the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/%7Enickmalik1/vault/Simple_Lifecycle_Agility_Maturity_Model.xls">Simple Lifecycle Agility Maturity
Model</a>
(aka SLAMM) as a way of measuring your “agile factor”. Surprisingly,
the community response has been zilch. After <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/15/tools-for-mort.aspx">Nick’s comments on
Agile</a>
last week, I figured <em>someone</em> would have <em>something</em> to say about
it, even if only to slam it. (Slam SLAMM, ha ha.) Maybe nobody
opened <a href="http://home.comcast.net/%7Enickmalik1/vault/Simple_Lifecycle_Agility_Maturity_Model.xls">the
spreadsheet</a>
and saw Mort has an agile factor rating of 71%? Personally, SLAMM
seems like a rather coarse tool for measuring how agile you are, but
coarse tools are better than no tools at all.</li>
