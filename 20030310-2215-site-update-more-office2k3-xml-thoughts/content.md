Kudos to Scott W & TripleASP.NET’s [Show My
Code](http://tripleasp.net/showcode.aspx) tool. I updated the source
code to my articles so the sample code would be syntax color coded. I
like it. Not 100% satisfied w/ the output – I did hand tool the results
a bit. Maybe there could be an option to spit out an XML adorned version
of the source code? Then I could put the \<br\> tags exactly where I
wanted them via an XSLT.

Speaking of XSLT, [FrontPage
2003](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/frontpage/default.asp) is
supposed to have an [XSLT graphical
editor](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/developer/downloads/OfficeSystemAndXML.doc).
But from some basic looking around, it appears that it only works in
conjunction a
[SharePoint](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/preview/default.asp)
based site. Too bad, I was hoping it would compete with
[Altova’s](http://www.xmlspy.com)[Stylevision graphical XSLT
editor](http://www.xmlspy.com/products_xsl.html). Given the relatively
high bar for XSLT development, and [Office
2003′s](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/default.asp) support of
XML in general and XSL in particular, I thought that FrontPage might
naturally evolve into an XSLT tool.

Anyone know where WordML schema is documented?
