    "content": "For a mature Python library to do XML to object serialization, take a look at lxml.objectify.\n\nhttp://codespeak.net/lxml/objectify.html\n\nYou really should try FePy. FePy doesn't run lxml.objectify yet (this one is a monster), but it does run gnosis.xml.objectify. And it runs same on CPython too.\n\nIt is impressive that you could cook up XML to object serializer in relative short time and code, but I personally won't use any IronPython-only solution when there are lots of mature Python solutions.",

    "content": "@Bryant, XDocument + LINQ is a HUGE improvement over XmlDocument. But support for late binding is what makes the Python version so much more readable. \n\n@Seo, Don't worry, I plan to take a very long look at FePy. Just haven't had the time yet. \n\nAs for my code, it's more about me learning Python not really about providing a definitive solution to any specific problem. I think xml2py could be tweaked to support pulldom with little effort. I just know .NET FX very well, so it's easier for me to focus on learning the language with a library I know then it is to learn the language and library at the same time. \n\nThanks for the link to lxml.objectify. I'll take a look at that too. I figure there must be other (and better) libraries out there that do something similar to xml2py. ",
