<p>Battlestar Galactica is already one of the two best shows on TV in my
opinion. Lost is one of the best shows ever, but I digress. Now comes
news that their doing a <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&amp;id=35773">prequel
spinoff</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SCI FI Channel announced the development of <em>Caprica</em>, a spinoff
prequel of its hit <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/"><em>Battlestar
Galactica</em></a>, in presentations to
advertisers in New York on April 26. <em>Caprica</em> would come from
<em>Galactica</em> executive producers Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, writer
Remi Aubuchon (<em>24</em>) and NBC Universal Television Studio.</p>
<p><em>Caprica</em> would take place more than half a century before the events
that play out in <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>. The people of the Twelve
Colonies are at peace and living in a society not unlike our own, but
where high technology has changed the lives of virtually everyone for
the better.</p>
<p>But a startling breakthrough in robotics is about to occur, one that
will bring to life the age-old dream of marrying artificial
intelligence with a mechanical body to create the first living robot:
a Cylon. Following the lives of two families, the Graystones and the
Adamas (the family of William Adama, who will one day become the
commander of the <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>), <em>Caprica</em> will weave
together corporate intrigue, techno-action and sexual politics into
televisionâ€™s first science fiction family saga, the channel announced.</p>

<p>OK, Comcast officially needs to get <a href="http://www.universalhd.com/">Universal
HD</a> so I can see this &amp; BSG in HD.</p>
