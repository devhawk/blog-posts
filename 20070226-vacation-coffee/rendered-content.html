<p>After a week’s vacation, I’m back in the office. I might have left with
an empty inbox and newsreader, but I returned to nearly 300 emails and
over 500 news items. Actually, 300 emails for a week is actually really
good – most of them are in my “low priority” folder which means they are
internal mailing list emails rather than things I actually have to deal
with.</p>
<p>Major thanks to <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/">Dale</a> for keeping
the lights on around here while I was gone. With my renewed commitment
to blogging this year, I’d rather not see DevHawk “go dark” for a week
while I get some R&amp;R. If you liked what Dale had to say, go <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/feed.rss">subscribe
to his blog</a>. I hope he
keeps up with his daily posts, now that he’s no longer on the hook
around here.</p>
<p>Anyway, since I have little idea what’s going on in the technical
blogosphere, this is a vacation wrapup instead. Normal Morning Coffee
returns tomorrow.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We spent a week in Southern California. Two days with my
brother-in-law in Santa Barbara, two days at Disneyland and two days
with my uncles in Palm Springs (with travel days between). We had a
blast, but that’s a lot of driving. Next vacation, we’re going
somewhere we don’t know anybody and staying put the entire time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>My brother-in-law has three kids, including a son a few months older
than Patrick and a daughter a few months younger than Riley. I’ve
long said I would <em>never</em> move back to Cali, but seeing them all
play together made me think it might be worth it. I don’t have any
cousins (my father was an only child and neither of my mother’s two
siblings had kids) so I didn’t realize what a big deal it is. I
think Patrick misses his cousin Jack more than he misses Disneyland.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When I lived in LA, I used to have a season pass to Disneyland. But
seeing it thru my kids’ eyes made it brand new again. Our two days
in “The Happiest Place on Earth” were a blast, though in retrospect
we should have taken a day to rest and hang out at the pool between
the two days.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Riley’s favorite ride was <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAttractionPage">Pirates of the
Caribbean</a>
(which she calls “Yo ho ho”). My friend Brooke told Jules that
little kids “natural reaction” is to hold on tight during the drops,
but Riley put her little hands up and shouted “Wee!” They recently
added some elements from the movies (Capt. Jack Sparrow and Davy
Jones) to the ride. My wife and I were worried they were going to
ruin it, but the changes were fairly small and subtle and we liked
them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Patrick’s favorite ride was <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=BuzzLightyearAttractionPage">Buzz Lightyear Astro
Blasters</a> but
the <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/entertainment/detail?name=JediTrainingAcademyEntertainmentPage">Jedi Training
Academy</a>
was a close second. His Jedi training was my favorite moment at
Disneyland. He got to <a href="http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=9914b46a-f969-4b5d-81a9-d6734d1018ba">train with a
lightsaber</a>
and <a href="http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=a029e258-7a76-4e39-a882-b44275397cd2">fight Darth
Maul</a>.
Here’s a video clip of my young Padawan:</p>
<p>The big problem with Jedi Training Academy is that they only pick a
limited number of “younglings” every show. Patrick didn’t get picked
the first time we went, and frankly I pushed him out there the
second time without him officially getting picked. You could
conceivably waste an entire day at Disneyland attending all six
Training Academy shows and never get picked. That sucks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Biggest disappointment of Disneyland: Patrick being 1″ too short for
<a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=StarToursAttractionPage">Star
Tours</a>.
I was bummed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/landing?name=DisneysCaliforniaAdventureLandingPage">Disney’s California
Adventure</a>
is a nice adjunct to Disneyland, but as a stand alone park it pretty
much blows, though Jules and I did enjoy the <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=TwilightZoneTowerOfTerrorAttractionPage">Tower of
Terror</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disneyland seems to becoming Disney-Pixar Land. Pixar movies are the
basis for several of the newer rides, including the new <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=FindingNemoSubmarineVoyageAttractionPage">Finding
Nemo
ride</a>
opening this summer. There was <a href="http://www.hemispheresmagazine.com/feb07/entertainthis.html">an
article</a>
in the Disneyland Pixar Evolution in the airplane magazine so I’m
not the only one who’s noticed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After two days in Disneyland, I expected Palm Springs to be a let
down. But instead it was a nice casual cool down after two hectic
days in the Magic Kingdom. Plus it was great to see my Uncles, who
we hadn’t seen since last summer when my brother got married.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We flew home Saturday so we could have a casual Sunday before
heading back to work and school today. We watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120915/">Phantom
Menace</a> last night, though the
kids are still a bit young for it. We decided on Episode I instead
of the original <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/">Star Wars</a>
because it has a little boy (i.e. like Patrick) and a fight with
Darth Maul (i.e. like Patrick). But it doesn’t hold a candle to the
original trilogy.</p>
