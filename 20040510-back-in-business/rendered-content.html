<p>So DevHawk is back in business, and more importantly it is now the
featured blog on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/">MSDN Architecture
Center</a>! Iâ€™ve spun up a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk">home
away from home</a> on the MSDN blogging
server for the Architecture Center to pull from. That way, I can
crosspost architecture related content from here, but still be able to
rant about hockey, gay marriage, programming and whatever the hell else
I want over here.</p>
