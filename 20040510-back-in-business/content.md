So DevHawk is back in business, and more importantly it is now the
featured blog on [MSDN Architecture
Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/)! Iâ€™ve spun up a [home
away from home](http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk) on the MSDN blogging
server for the Architecture Center to pull from. That way, I can
crosspost architecture related content from here, but still be able to
rant about hockey, gay marriage, programming and whatever the hell else
I want over here.
