It took 30 hours of game play, spread out over a month and a half, but I
finally finished [Star Wars: Knights of the Old
Republic](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/starwarskotorepublic/default.htm).
It’s easy to see why this game received so many [Game of the Year
honors](http://www.lucasarts.com/products/swkotor/awards.html), it’s the
best game I’ve ever played. And what’s even cooler is that I want to
play it again, this time as a bad guy. The whole light vs. dark side
conflict works very well and I’m really curious to see how the game
progresses when you’re more Vader than Anakin.

I can’t wait to see [Bioware’s](http://www.bioware.com/) next XBOX
effort: [Jade Empire](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/jadeempire). Between
that and [Fable](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/fable/default.htm), this
should be a good year for RPGs on XBOX.
