We’ve updated the Architecture Center [blog
page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/blogs). We added
[John Evdemon](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon) (who I already
[blogged](http://devhawk.net/2004/06/10/new-blogger-from-the-team-formerly-known-as-neat/)),
[Stuart Kent](http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/) and [Alan Cameron
Wills](http://blogs.msdn.com/alan_cameron_wills). Stuart and Alan work
on the Enterprise Frameworks and Tools team which is producing the
[VS2005 modeling
tools](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vsts-arch.asp)
formerly known as Whitehorse. They are mostly blogging about
[domain-specific
languages](http://weblogs.asp.net/alan_cameron_wills/archive/2004/04/13/112473.aspx)
(DSL), [software product
lines](http://weblogs.asp.net/alan_cameron_wills/archive/2004/04/13/112431.aspx),
[code generation from
models](http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2004/06/14/155132.aspx)
and a variety of other [Software
Factories](http://www.softwarefactories.com/) related ideas. They also
touch on the relationship of the DSL/Factories approach to the UML/MDA
approach. Stuart has a [great
response](http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/articles/142330.aspx) to a
post by [Grady Booch](http://www.booch.com/architecture/blog.jsp) where
Grady disparages the DSL approach stating that he “always found the DSL
play to be one of classic over-engineering”. Given the recent “[Unwanted
Modeling
Language](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnwantedModelingLanguage.html)”
backlash against UML 2, I’m not sure how fair it is for Grady to be
calling any modeling approach over-engineered.
