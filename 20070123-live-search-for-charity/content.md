about two charity search sites hosted by [Live
Search](http://blogs.msdn.com/livesearch/archive/2007/01/22/use-live-search-and-we-ll-donate-to-team-seattle-and-ninemillion-org.aspx).
Use
[teamseattle.live.com](http://teamseattle.live.com/Search/Charity/TeamSeattle/Default.aspx) to
search and you help sponsor Children’s Hospital. Use
[click4thecause.live.com](http://click4thecause.live.com/) to search and
you help sponsor [Ninemillion.org](http://ninemillion.org/), which is
working to help the 9 million refugee children worldwide.

GIven that I’m already using Live Search, changing my default search
page from Live.com to one of these two seems was a no brainer. I use the
IE7 Search Box more often than not, so I also set up a [custom search
provider](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/searchguide/en-en/default.mspx).
However, that’s a bit of a PITA, so I took the [OpenSearch
Description](http://opensearch.a9.com/spec/1.1/description/) XML files
and hosted them here @ DevHawk. Click the links below to add them to IE7
search box.

-   Add [Click4TheCause Charity Search](http://www.click4thecause.live.com/) to your IE7 Search Box
-   Add [TeamSeattle Charity Search](http://www.teamseattle.live.com/) to your IE7 Search Box

I’m sure there’s a way to do this for Firefox’s search bar, but I have
no idea how. If you – dear reader – know how to add search providers,
please [send me email](mailto:harry.pierson@microsoft.com) and I’ll
update this post accordingly.
