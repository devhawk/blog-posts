As soon as I saw it listed I thought it was a great name. I see we have similar taste in that regard. \n\nIn any event, I'm a long time programmer (10 years plus). You can see a bunch of sties I've worked on over the years on my portfolio site at www.adhocdevelopment.com. While I admit that most of the content at devhawk.com will be syndicated, there are about a dozen original articles I wrote myself, and I plan to write a new article about one per week. Most of the articles are about ecommerce software, or search engine optimization. \n\nAnyways, I thought I'd stop by and say , \"Hi\"."
