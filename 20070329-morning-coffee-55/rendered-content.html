<li>Many years ago, I picked .net instead of .com as DevHawk’s TLD. My
old pal Chris picked up devhawk.com and redirected it to the site
because he got tired of typing “devhawk ctl-enter” into the browser
address bar and getting nothing. He must have let it lapse because
now devhawk.com points to what looks like a splog in development.
Part of me is annoyed, but a bigger part of me just doesn’t give a
shit. You – dear reader – have found this site, and that is all I
care about.</li>
<li>A couple of weekends ago, I re-wired my living room to enable
surround sound. It meant adding a receiver to the mix, and that
pushed us into three remote territory, which is too many. So I
picked up a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/features/harmony/US/EN,CRID=2078">Logitech Harmony Universal
Remote</a>,
since they have one <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/detailsharmony/US/EN,CRID=2084,CONTENTID=11250">specifically for the Xbox
360</a>.
So far so good, but I’m not sure my wife likes it much yet. However,
their remote config application doesn’t run on Vista yet, so I had
to bust out the old laptop to get it working.</li>
<li>I’ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/08/02/lang-net-is-helping-game-developers/">written
about</a>
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/specsharp/">Spec#</a>
before, but I’ve never experimented with it. MS Research just
released a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/f96c1618-b332-4106-b0fc-911346d5f537/Details.aspx">new version</a>
that support VS05, so here’s my chance. (via

<li>Speaking of MS Research, the <a href="http://labs.live.com/Deepfish/default.aspx">Deepfish
project</a> has released a
new <a href="http://labs.live.com/deepfish/dfblogs/Take+Deepfish+For+A+Swim.aspx">tech
preview</a>.
However, Loke Uei is reporting they’ve <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lokeuei/archive/2007/03/29/deepfish-technology-preview-available-now.aspx">already maxed
out</a>
on test accounts. (via <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/03/28/deepfish.aspx">Major

<li>Jeff Atwood says there’s <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000827.html">no substitute for learning on the
battlefield</a>.
I always say that the only way to get good at something is to suck
at it for a while. Different words, same concept.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nnaderi/archive/2007/03/27/unit-testing-trickling-into-pro.aspx">According to Naysawn
Naderi</a>,
the “majority” of unit test features are being added to the Orcas
Pro version. This is obviously good news, though personally I <a href="http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2007/03/28/22529.aspx">agree
with
Brad</a>
that they should available separately VS. Not sure it needs to be in
the framework itself, inclusion in the .NET Framework SDK is
probably sufficient. I also think there should be unit test support
in the VS express editions as well. (via

<li>I’ve been digging <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/">Geekdad</a>, but
most of the stuff is for older kids. I mean, I’d love to take <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2007/03/karting_with_da.html">my
daughter
karting</a>,
but she’s only two and can’t reach the pedals! However, I’m itching
to try out today’s post on <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2007/03/fun_with_image_.html">image searching with younger
kids</a>.
The kids love to draw on my new tablet, so I’m thinking of not only
searching but snipping these images into OneNote for them to doodle
on.</li>
