sure that I like the idea of music rental, but I would pay a monthly
fee to Apple if I could get access to any piece of music anytime even
if just for a while after using Napster for even a few days.  The
software experience needs work, but it is a lot better than I ever
expected it to be.  Napster has something here actually, but most
people don’t realize it yet because Microsoft and the industry is
doing a piss poor job at showing just how interesting life can be in
this model.” [<a href="http://lennpryor.blogs.com/lenn/2005/02/2005_the_year_o.html">Lenn

<p>While Lenn admits that “Napster has something here actually”, I guess I
have never understood the issue some people have with “music rental”.
You don’t own the music and you never did. You’ve always owned a copy of
the music. You “rented” the music in perpetuity (that’s legalese for “a
long ass time”) for a flat fee. You can argue that the record labels
have kept more than their fair share of said flat fee, but it doesn’t
change the fact that you never owned anything but a copy.</p>
<p>Personally, I like the Napster model much better. I am paying $15 a
month in perpetuity but I get access to pretty much everything that
comes out. Actually, I’m not even paying yet – I’m still in my 14 day
trial period. But I’ve downloaded nearly 3GB so far including a variety
of stuff that I was going to buy on CD anyway when I got around to it.
Life is certainly more interesting under this model.</p>
