-   Big news since my last Morning Coffee post was the announcement of
    [Live Mesh](https://www.mesh.com/). I’ve been running it for about a
    month, and I’m really digging it. Make sure you check out the [team
    blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/) and watch the [developer tour
    video](http://www.mesh.com/Welcome/TourDeveloper.aspx) (be on the
    lookout for IPy about half way thru the video)

ALT.NET

-   I had a great time @ the [ALT.NET](http://altdotnet.org/) open space
    conference last weekend. I was somewhat distracted on Saturday as
    due to a family communication mixup, I had to bring my son Patrick
    with me. [Jeffrey
    Palermo](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/) shot a [cute
    video of
    him](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2008/04/19/alt-net-attendees-video-posted.aspx)
    (3 minutes in) where he explains that he’s at the conference “to be
    with my dad”. Having a five year old is a little distracting, but
    everyone was amazingly cool with having him around. When he gets a
    little older I have no doubt he’ll be attending conferences and
    leading open sessions.
-   I did a session on F\#, but it felt kinda all over the place. I
    hadn’t touched F\# in a few months and it showed IMO. [Matt
    Podwysocki](http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/default.aspx) was
    there to help keep the session from devolving into mass chaos.
    Thanks Matt.
-   My favorite session of the conference was Scott Hanselman’s “Are We
    Innovating?” talk, which I think originated from a question I asked
    him: There are many examples of large OSS projects in other dev
    communities that get ported to .NET
    ([NHibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/343.html),
    [NAnt](http://nant.sourceforge.net/),
    [MonoRail](http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html), etc).
    Can you name one that’s gone the other way? I can’t.
-   I took [Matt’s
    advice](http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/04/24/alt-net-open-spaces-closing-day-recap.aspx)
    and joined the local [ALT.NET Seattle
    group](http://groups.google.com/group/altnetseattle).

DyLang Stuff

-   Martin Maly [posts
    about](http://blogs.msdn.com/mmaly/archive/2008/04/22/dlr-caches.aspx)
    how dynamic method dispatches are cached in three different layers
    by the DLR. You shouldn’t care about this stuff if you’re a DLR
    language user, but you will certainly care about it if you’re a DLR
    language builder.
-   I’m really excited to see Phil Haack (whom I met F2F @ ALT.NET) is
    [experimenting with IronRuby & ASP.NET
    MVC](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/04/22/defining-asp.net-mvc-routes-and-views-in-ironruby.aspx).
    True, I’d rather it was IPy, but his Routes.LoadFromRuby would work
    with Python with very little code change.
-   Note to self, take a deeper look at
    [Twining](http://www.t3rse.com/twining/), the IPy database DSL by
    [David Seruyange](http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/).
-   Daily Michael Foord – [Ironclad 0.2
    Released](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2008_04_19.shtml#e968).
    Ironclad is a project to implement [Python’s C extension
    API](http://docs.python.org/api/api.html) in C\# so that IronPython
    could load standard Python C modules like
    [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/).
    So far, they’re able to load the [bz2
    module](http://docs.python.org/lib/module-bz2.html). 

Other Stuff

-   Congrats to
    [Brad](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2008/04/xunitnet-10-rel.html)
    and
    [Jim](http://jamesnewkirk.typepad.com/posts/2008/04/xunitnet-10-rel.html)
    for shipping [xUnit.net
    1.0](http://www.codeplex.com/xunit/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=12516).
-   Everyone seems to be jumping on the functional C\# coding bandwagon.
    Bart De Smet’s series on pattern matching in C\# is [currently at
    eight
    posts](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2008/04/16/pattern-matching-in-c-part-8.aspx).
    Now Luca Bolognese is in on the action, with three posts so far on
    [functional code in
    C\#](http://blogs.msdn.com/lucabol/archive/2008/04/21/a-c-library-to-write-functional-code-part-iii-records.aspx).
    I like how Luca keeps writing that the C\# syntax is “not terrible”
    for functional programming. Again, why suffer thru the “not
    terrible” syntax when you could be using F\# instead? (via [Charlie
    Calvert](http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/04/23/community-convergence-xliii.aspx))
-   I need to take a look at
    [VLinq](http://blogs.msdn.com/mitsu/archive/2008/04/02/visual-linq-query-builder-for-linq-to-sql-vlinq.aspx).
    Charlie and [Scott
    Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheWeeklySourceCode23BigSolutionEdition.aspx)
    both mentioned it recently.
-   I would like to have been [in the
    conversation](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/04/16/Do+You+Fall+Prey+To+Technical+Folk+Etymology.aspx)
    with Ted Neward, Neal Ford, Venkat Subramaniam, Don Box and Amanda
    Silver.
-   I haven’t had any time to play with XNA of late, which means the
    [great list of GDC
    videos](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2008/04/20/gdc-2008-presenations-are-now-available.aspx)
    Dave Weller posted on the XNA team blog will remain beyond my
    ability to invest time for now.
-   There’s a [new
    drop](http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/8826adb9-8398-40d6-a22d-951923fe2647/Details.aspx)
    of [Spec\#](http://research.microsoft.com/specsharp/?0sr=a) from MS
    Research. [IronRuby](http://rubyforge.org/projects/ironruby/) is
    using Spec\# heavily as I recall.
