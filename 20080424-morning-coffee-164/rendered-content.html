<li>Big news since my last Morning Coffee post was the announcement of
<a href="https://www.mesh.com/">Live Mesh</a>. I’ve been running it for about a
month, and I’m really digging it. Make sure you check out the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/">team
blog</a> and watch the <a href="http://www.mesh.com/Welcome/TourDeveloper.aspx">developer tour
video</a> (be on the
lookout for IPy about half way thru the video)</li>

<li>I had a great time @ the <a href="http://altdotnet.org/">ALT.NET</a> open space
conference last weekend. I was somewhat distracted on Saturday as
due to a family communication mixup, I had to bring my son Patrick
with me. <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/">Jeffrey
Palermo</a> shot a <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2008/04/19/alt-net-attendees-video-posted.aspx">cute
video of
him</a>
(3 minutes in) where he explains that he’s at the conference “to be
with my dad”. Having a five year old is a little distracting, but
everyone was amazingly cool with having him around. When he gets a
little older I have no doubt he’ll be attending conferences and
leading open sessions.</li>
<li>I did a session on F#, but it felt kinda all over the place. I
hadn’t touched F# in a few months and it showed IMO. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/default.aspx">Matt
Podwysocki</a> was
there to help keep the session from devolving into mass chaos.
Thanks Matt.</li>
<li>My favorite session of the conference was Scott Hanselman’s “Are We
Innovating?” talk, which I think originated from a question I asked
him: There are many examples of large OSS projects in other dev
communities that get ported to .NET
(<a href="http://www.hibernate.org/343.html">NHibernate</a>,
<a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">NAnt</a>,
<a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html">MonoRail</a>, etc).
Can you name one that’s gone the other way? I can’t.</li>
<li>I took <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/04/24/alt-net-open-spaces-closing-day-recap.aspx">Matt’s
advice</a>
and joined the local <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/altnetseattle">ALT.NET Seattle
group</a>.</li>

<li>Martin Maly <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mmaly/archive/2008/04/22/dlr-caches.aspx">posts
about</a>
how dynamic method dispatches are cached in three different layers
by the DLR. You shouldn’t care about this stuff if you’re a DLR
language user, but you will certainly care about it if you’re a DLR
language builder.</li>
<li>I’m really excited to see Phil Haack (whom I met F2F @ ALT.NET) is
<a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/04/22/defining-asp.net-mvc-routes-and-views-in-ironruby.aspx">experimenting with IronRuby &amp; ASP.NET
MVC</a>.
True, I’d rather it was IPy, but his Routes.LoadFromRuby would work
with Python with very little code change.</li>
<li>Note to self, take a deeper look at
<a href="http://www.t3rse.com/twining/">Twining</a>, the IPy database DSL by
<a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/">David Seruyange</a>.</li>
<li>Daily Michael Foord – <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2008_04_19.shtml#e968">Ironclad 0.2
Released</a>.
Ironclad is a project to implement <a href="http://docs.python.org/api/api.html">Python’s C extension
API</a> in C# so that IronPython
could load standard Python C modules like
<a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> and <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>.
So far, they’re able to load the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-bz2.html">bz2
module</a>. </li>

<li>Congrats to

and
<a href="http://jamesnewkirk.typepad.com/posts/2008/04/xunitnet-10-rel.html">Jim</a>

<li>Everyone seems to be jumping on the functional C# coding bandwagon.
Bart De Smet’s series on pattern matching in C# is <a href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2008/04/16/pattern-matching-in-c-part-8.aspx">currently at
eight
posts</a>.
Now Luca Bolognese is in on the action, with three posts so far on
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lucabol/archive/2008/04/21/a-c-library-to-write-functional-code-part-iii-records.aspx">functional code in
C#</a>.
I like how Luca keeps writing that the C# syntax is “not terrible”
for functional programming. Again, why suffer thru the “not
terrible” syntax when you could be using F# instead? (via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/04/23/community-convergence-xliii.aspx">Charlie
Calvert</a>)</li>
<li>I need to take a look at
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mitsu/archive/2008/04/02/visual-linq-query-builder-for-linq-to-sql-vlinq.aspx">VLinq</a>.
Charlie and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/ScottHanselman/%7E3/267517424/TheWeeklySourceCode23BigSolutionEdition.aspx">Scott
Hanselman</a>
both mentioned it recently.</li>
<li>I would like to have been <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/04/16/Do+You+Fall+Prey+To+Technical+Folk+Etymology.aspx">in the
conversation</a>
with Ted Neward, Neal Ford, Venkat Subramaniam, Don Box and Amanda
Silver.</li>
<li>I haven’t had any time to play with XNA of late, which means the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2008/04/20/gdc-2008-presenations-are-now-available.aspx">great list of GDC
videos</a>
Dave Weller posted on the XNA team blog will remain beyond my
ability to invest time for now.</li>
<li>There’s a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/8826adb9-8398-40d6-a22d-951923fe2647/Details.aspx">new
drop</a>
of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/specsharp/?0sr=a">Spec#</a> from MS
Research. <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ironruby/">IronRuby</a> is
using Spec# heavily as I recall.</li>
