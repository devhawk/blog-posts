    "content": "Hey, Harry!\n\nQuestion: How long is \"...several MOTHS...\"? Is that a typo or have we started measuring time in terms of the lifespan of tiny winged creatures?\n\nCorrection: Culpepper has one (1) \"L\" and three (3) \"P\"s. Good news is, the link is right, though.\n\nThanks for the plug. Thanks for the welcome. I can't wait to rejoin the greatest company that I have ever worked for... one of the greatest in the world, for sure.\n\nThanks,\n\nRick"
