<p>It's been a looooong time, but I finally got around to geting DevHawk
back online. It's hard to believe that it's been over a year since
<a href="/blog/2014/4/26/yet-more-change-for-the-capitals">my last post</a>.
Lots has happened in that time!</p>
<p>First off, I've changed jobs (again). Last year, I made the switch
<a href="/blog/2014/2/14/putting-the-dev-back-in-devhawk">from program manager to dev</a>.
Unfortunately, the project I was working on was cancelled. After several months in limbo,
I was reorganized into the <a href="http://dotnet.github.io/core/">.NET Core framework team</a>
back over in DevDiv. I've got lots of friends in DevDiv and love
<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx">the open source work they are doing</a>.
But I really missed being in Windows. Earlier this year, I joined the team that builds the
platform plumbing for <a href="http://www.xbox.com/smartglass">SmartGlass</a>.
Not much to talk about publicly right now, but that will change sometime soon.</p>
<p>In addition to my day job in SmartGlass, I'm also pitching in to help the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/serving-communities/disaster-and-humanitarian-response/">Microsoft Services Disaster
Response team</a>.
I knew Microsoft has a long history of corporate giving. However, I was unaware
of the work we do helping communities affected by natural disasters until recently.
My good friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewiscurtis">Lewis Curtis</a> took over as
Director of Microsoft Services Disaster Response last year.
I'm currently helping out on some of the missions for Nepal in response to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake">devestating earthquake</a> that hit there earlier this year.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided that I was tired of running Other Peoples Code<sup>tm</sup> on <em>my</em> website.
So I built out a new blog engine called Hawk.
It's written in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/kx37x362.aspx">C#</a>
(plus about 30 lines of JavaScript), uses <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/home/">ASP.NET 5</a> and runs on <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/">Azure</a>.
It's specifically designed for my needs - for example, it automatically
redirects old DasBlog style links like <a href="/2005/10/05/code+is+model.aspx">http://devhawk.net/2005/10/05/code+is+model.aspx</a>.
But I'm happy to let other people use it and would welcome contributions.
When I get a chance, I'll push the code up to GitHub.</p>
