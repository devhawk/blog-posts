It's been a looooong time, but I finally got around to geting DevHawk
back online. It's hard to believe that it's been over a year since 
[my last post](/blog/2014/4/26/yet-more-change-for-the-capitals). 
Lots has happened in that time!

First off, I've changed jobs (again). Last year, I made the switch
[from program manager to dev](/blog/2014/2/14/putting-the-dev-back-in-devhawk). 
Unfortunately, the project I was working on was cancelled. After several months in limbo,
I was reorganized into the [.NET Core framework team](http://dotnet.github.io/core/) 
back over in DevDiv. I've got lots of friends in DevDiv and love
[the open source work they are doing](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx).
But I really missed being in Windows. Earlier this year, I joined the team that builds the 
platform plumbing for [SmartGlass](http://www.xbox.com/smartglass). 
Not much to talk about publicly right now, but that will change sometime soon. 

In addition to my day job in SmartGlass, I'm also pitching in to help the [Microsoft Services Disaster
Response team](http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/serving-communities/disaster-and-humanitarian-response/). 
I knew Microsoft has a long history of corporate giving. However, I was unaware
of the work we do helping communities affected by natural disasters until recently. 
My good friend [Lewis Curtis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewiscurtis) took over as 
Director of Microsoft Services Disaster Response last year. 
I'm currently helping out on some of the missions for Nepal in response to the 
[devestating earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake) that hit there earlier this year.    

Finally, I decided that I was tired of running Other Peoples Code^tm^ on *my* website. 
So I built out a new blog engine called Hawk. 
It's written in [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/kx37x362.aspx) 
(plus about 30 lines of JavaScript), uses [ASP.NET 5](https://github.com/aspnet/home/) and runs on [Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/). 
It's specifically designed for my needs - for example, it automatically 
redirects old DasBlog style links like [http://devhawk.net/2005/10/05/code+is+model.aspx](/2005/10/05/code+is+model.aspx). 
But I'm happy to let other people use it and would welcome contributions. 
When I get a chance, I'll push the code up to GitHub.
