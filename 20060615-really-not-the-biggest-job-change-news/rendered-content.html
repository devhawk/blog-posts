<p><strong>Microsoft Announces Plans for July 2008 Transition for Bill Gates</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Corp. today announced that effective July 2008 Bill Gates,
chairman, will transition out of a day-to-day role in the company to
spend more time on his global health and education work at the Bill &amp;
Melinda Gates Foundation. The company announced a two-year transition
process to ensure that there is a smooth and orderly transfer of
Gates’ daily responsibilities, and said that after July 2008 Gates
would continue to serve as the company’s chairman and an advisor on
key development projects.</p>
<p>The company announced that Chief Technical Officer Ray Ozzie will
immediately assume the title of chief software architect and begin
working side by side with Gates on all technical architecture and
product oversight responsibilities, to ensure a smooth transition.
Similarly, Chief Technical Officer Craig Mundie will immediately take
the new title of chief research and strategy officer and will work
closely with Gates to assume his responsibility for the company’s
research and incubation efforts; Mundie also will partner with general
counsel Brad Smith to guide Microsoft’s intellectual property and
technology policy efforts.</p>
