<p>Last week at Mashup Camp, <a href="http://cheerleader.yoz.com">Yoz</a> showed me
<a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>. I had heard about Ning, Ning is a social
software enabler…I guess enabler is the best word…with a fascinating
approach to building software. Well, getting started building software
at any rate. While they provide other more basic functions like hosting,
Ning provides the ability to clone almost <a href="http://browse.ning.com/application/any">all of the
apps</a> running on their site
(over 6500 as I write this). When you clone an app, Ning makes a copy of
all the files from that app on your own domain (typically
appname.ning.com, though you can pay to have your own domain name). They
also provide a set of <a href="http://www.ning.com/?view=xapps">basic starter
apps</a> that you can clone to get
started.</p>
<p>I decided to try it myself. Behold <a href="http://partisanhacks.ning.com/">Partisan
Hacks</a>.</p>
<p>Partisan Hacks is a clone of Ning’s <a href="http://doirock.ning.com/">Do I
Rock?</a> starter app, which is itself basically
a copy of <a href="http://www.hotornot.com/">Hot or Not</a>. The difference is that
you rate how big a partisan hack the individuals are. As I wrote for the
About page, I was basically inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stewart">Jon
Stewart’s</a> now <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2652831">famous
appearance</a> on the now
cancelled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossfire_(TV_series)">CNN
Crossfire</a>. Of
course, I’ve been <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/02/11/dennis-miller-has-jumped-the-shark/">throwing the term
around</a>
myself a bit lately, hence the reason why the topic was top of mind for
me.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, I added two features to the basic Do I
Rock template code. First, I modified the detail page to include a link
to Wikipedia as well as to pull in search results from MSN. Second, I
added an RSS feed to the <a href="http://partisanhacks.ning.com/list.php?sort=winner">most
partisan</a>, <a href="http://partisanhacks.ning.com/list.php?sort=loser">least
partisan</a> and <a href="http://partisanhacks.ning.com/list.php?sort=new">newest
additions</a> to the site.
I’d never used PHP before, so it took me a bit longer that I would have
expected to make the changes, but still it only took me a couple hours
to make those as well as other minor cosmetic changes to the site.</p>
<p>While hacking PHP was somewhat tedious (back to my ASP days of the mid
90′s), one area that is both compelling and productive is the <a href="http://documentation.ning.com/sections/basics.php#contentstore">Ning
Content
Store</a>.
It’s the shared database on the back end of any Ning application. I
didn’t really make any changes to my content, but it appears to dead
simple to add new info to content objects. I was thinking about how I
would build this app w/ ASP.NET, and realized that having to build a
custom database would offset most of the productivity I would gain from
using ASP.NET instead of PHP. According to <a href="http://documentation.ning.com/sections/roadmap.php">Ning’s
Roadmap</a>, they’ll be
bringing <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and
<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> support online soon. I’ll have to
see how much better an experience that is than their current PHP based
approach.</p>
