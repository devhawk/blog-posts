-   I figured out something to build with PowerShell. Not ready to spill
    all the beans yet, but I’ve started by building a
    [provider](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714636.aspx)
    for SQL Server. SQL already has the [SQL Management Objects
    (SMO)](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162169.aspx) library,
    so I can really focus on how PowerShell works rather than getting
    too bogged down in the logic of the provider. I’m sure someone else
    is working on something similar, but my primary goal with building
    this provider is to understand PowerShell. The codebase itself is a
    distant second in priority.
-   On the subject of missing LINQ’s, Alex James wants [LINQ to
    Web](http://www.base4.net/Blog.aspx?ID=300). A good potential use
    for the [Windows Live Search
    API](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb251794.aspx).
-   I posted three recent blog posts to
    [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/) yesterday, but I’ve only
    collected one additional kick so far (for my [Compiling Workflows
    post](http://devhawk.net/2007/01/29/compiling-workflows/)).
    Looking at what does gather kicks, I think I would need to write a
    more dev focused article if I wanted to make the DNK home page.

    [comment](http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,a8ceccf6-df2a-4213-9b87-ef1d46e31516.aspx#commentstart)
    on my WSSF post where he talked about the developer and the
    architect perspective. He seemed surprised that I took the developer
    perspective. To quote [David White](http://davidjwhite.net/myblog/):
    “Architect Must Implement”. The customization opportunity in
    guidance automation is huge, but the value is to the developer
    first. And while it’s a good start, it doesn’t go very far at
    automating the development experience. At heart, I guess I’m a
    developer even though my business card sez Architect (with a capital
    “A” these days no less).
-   I moved my laptop over to Vista yesterday. My workstation is still
    on XP, but that’s because I haven’t had time to completely rebuild
    my dev environment. No Aero support with the
-   I elbowed my way into the TS Gateway pilot at Microsoft and I’m
    loving it. [TS
    Gateway](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/longhorn/terminal-services/default.mspx)
    is a new feature of Longhorn Server that “enables authorized remote
    users to connect to terminal servers and remote desktops on the
    corporate network from any Internet-connected device running Remote
    Desktop Connection 6.0.” So I can quickly and easily remote into my
    desktop from anywhere without establishing a VPC session. The only
    annoyance is my USB smart card reader, which is fine in a pinch but
    a pain to constantly have dangling off my laptop. However, my boss
    approved a PCMCIA smart card reader so soon that won’t be an issue.
