<p>Actually, I don’t think he’s “officially” part of the team ’til next
week, but Josh Lee has already <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/finservguy">started a
blog</a> about his new job on the
Architecture Strategy team. Josh is “The FinServ Guy”, and is a member
of the <a href="http://www.ifxforum.org/ifxforum.org/index.cfm">IFX Forum</a> Board
of Directors. Nothing really meaty on his blog yet, just a Hello World
post, but I hear great things about him.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Architecture Strategy team, I <em>finally</em> took 5 minutes
to term serv into the machine that hosts DevHawk to update the theme. I
keep mentioning the Architecture Strategy extended team <a href="http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx">OPML
file</a>, but I wanted to add a blogroll
to the site theme. Now, I have a Team Blogroll on the left hand side of
my website featuring all of my blogging teammates as well as all the
blogging architect evangelists. Enjoy. </p>
