Actually, I don’t think he’s “officially” part of the team ’til next
week, but Josh Lee has already [started a
blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/finservguy) about his new job on the
Architecture Strategy team. Josh is “The FinServ Guy”, and is a member
of the [IFX Forum](http://www.ifxforum.org/ifxforum.org/index.cfm) Board
of Directors. Nothing really meaty on his blog yet, just a Hello World
post, but I hear great things about him.

Speaking of the Architecture Strategy team, I *finally* took 5 minutes
to term serv into the machine that hosts DevHawk to update the theme. I
keep mentioning the Architecture Strategy extended team [OPML
file](http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx), but I wanted to add a blogroll
to the site theme. Now, I have a Team Blogroll on the left hand side of
my website featuring all of my blogging teammates as well as all the
blogging architect evangelists. Enjoy.
