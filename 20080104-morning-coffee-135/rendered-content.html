<li>Congrats to Barack Obama for <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/03/iowa.caucuses/">walking
away</a> with
the Iowa Democratic Caucus, which <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/01/03/democratic-caucus-turnout-shatters-record/">set turnout
records</a>.
Frankly, I’m pretty cool with any of the democratic front runners
but I think Obama has the best chance of winning in November. I’m
not sure Edwards second time around will be any more successful than
the last and I believe Clinton would drive the GOP GOTV campaign
better than any of the actual GOP candidates would.</li>
<li>Obviously, I like to play M-rated games like Bioshock and Mass
Effect. But I also like games I can play with my kids like <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/legostarwarssaga/">Lego
Star Wars</a>. There are
two new Lego games coming out this year: <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/legoindianajones/">Lego Indiana
Jones</a> and <a href="http://videogames.yahoo.com/feature/lego-batman-y-exclusive-trailer/1167883">Lego
Batman</a>.
I can’t wait.</li>
<li>Speaking of gaming, Xbox LIVE had <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/12/29/xbox-live-status-12-29.aspx">some
issues</a>
over the holiday break, due to record setting sign-ups and
concurrent users. Record setting numbers is a nice problem to have
if you’re on the business side, but a not-so-nice if you’re a
customer or work in operations. The XBL GM announced they’re
offering a “<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/live/serviceissue.htm">token of
appreciation</a>”
for everyone’s patience – a free XBLA game. Assuming it’s not a
crappy game, it’s a classy move.</li>
<li>I watched Transformers on HD-DVD last night. Fun movie with lots of
action, but man is it dumb. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001806/">John
Turturro</a> is the only real
stand-out.</li>
<li>Dustin Campbell
<a href="http://diditwith.net/2008/01/01/BuildingDataOutOfThinAir.aspx">implements</a>
cons, cdr and car from Scheme in C# and VB. While of limited
production value (Dustin specifically warns readers not to use any
of his code), it really demonstrates how different the functional
world is from the object/imperative one, right down to the concept
of type. Cons doesn’t return a tuple, it returns function with two
bound variables. (via
