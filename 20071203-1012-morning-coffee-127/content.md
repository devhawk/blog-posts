-   I’m back at the office today after almost two weeks away. So
    “catch-up” is the official hyphenated word of the day.
-   Big news last week was an [update on
    Silverlight](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/29/net-web-product-roadmap-asp-net-silverlight-iis7.aspx).
    The next version (the one with the embedded cross-platform CLR in
    it) was rebranded Silverlight 2.0 and will include higher-level UI
    framework features and richer networking support. Look for a go-live
    beta Q1 next year.
-   [According to Scott
    Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/29/net-web-product-roadmap-asp-net-silverlight-iis7.aspx),
    there should be a CTP of the ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions this week,
    including the new ASP.NET MVC framework that many folks await with
    baited breath. Scott posted the
    [second](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/03/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-2-url-routing.aspx)
    in new series on this framework, this time covering URL Routing.
-   After a long blog silence, [Pat
    Helland](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/) posted four
    presentations that he delivered @ TechEd Barcelona. They’re pretty
    much required reading as far as I am concerned. Here’s hoping the
    TechEd Barcelona folks recorded at least the audio of these
    sessions.

        Operations](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/11/25/presentation-of-metropolis-interchangeability-of-operations-at-teched-emea-in-barcelona.aspx)

-   There’s a [new drop of
    F\#](http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/e8478d6b-49c0-4750-80eb-0e424d1631a3/Details.aspx),
    v1.9.3.7. Don Syme [calls
    it](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/11/30/f-1-9-3-candidate-release-now-available.aspx)
    “a release candidate for F\# 1.9.3″. Full [release
    notes](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/11/30/full-release-notes-for-f-1-9-3-7.aspx)
    are over on his blog.
-   Speaking of F\#, Douglas Stockwell explains how to [roll-your-own
    F\# Express](http://11011.net/archives/000721.html) by combining the
    F\# download above & the VS08 shell.
-   Still speaking of F\#, Robert Pickering has written an [article on
    Active
    Patterns](http://www.infoq.com/articles/Beyond-Foundations-FSharp)
    as well as a series on concurrency in F\#. So far he’s covered
    [Async
    Workflows](http://www.strangelights.com/blog/archive/2007/09/29/1597.aspx)
    ([twice](http://www.strangelights.com/blog/archive/2007/10/15/1599.aspx)),
    [Erlang style
    messages](http://www.strangelights.com/blog/archive/2007/10/24/1601.aspx)
    and [message
    queuing](http://www.strangelights.com/blog/archive/2007/11/02/1604.aspx).
-   Speaking of concurrency, Soma
    [announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/11/29/parallel-extensions-to-the-net-fx-ctp.aspx)
    the [CTP of
    ParallelFX](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e848dc1d-5be3-4941-8705-024bc7f180ba&displaylang=en)
    last week. This includes [Parallel
    LINQ](http://blogs.msdn.com/pfxteam/archive/2007/11/29/6558508.aspx)
    (aka PLINQ) and [Task Parallel
    Library](http://blogs.msdn.com/pfxteam/archive/2007/11/29/6558543.aspx)
    (aka TPL). Also check out their
    [whitepaper](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=633F9F08-AAD9-46C4-8CAE-B204472838E1),

    center](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/concurrency).
-   I’m a big fan of the [Architecture
    Journal](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/arcjournal/). Now you can get
    all that great content in a [great WPF-based
    app](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=dd466bbb-1b7d-438e-9f9a-954ce2058f15&displaylang=en).
