<p>So we’re one week out on TechEd. This time next week, the final prep
will be done and we’ll be ready to let this thing fly. Some of the core
team goes down this week, though as a track owner, I’m not really needed
on site until Sunday.</p>
<p>What a difference a year makes. Last year, I was freaking out – it was
my first TechEd. Now I feel like the old hand at this. Of course, I
wouldn’t have made it through last year with out the assistance of a few
key individuals. Among others was
<a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/TechEd05Schorr/">Esther</a>, who just
started blogging for this year’s TechEd. She’s got a <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/TechEd05Schorr/Blog/cns!1prBmci9mgNi52HFewHJdIvQ!105.entry">long
post</a>
about the track cabanas. Last year, they were a big hit, but there were
a few glitches. Esther writes about some of the changes they made this
year to address those issues.</p>
<p>If you’re going to TechEd, make sure to stop by the ARC cabana and say
hi.</p>
