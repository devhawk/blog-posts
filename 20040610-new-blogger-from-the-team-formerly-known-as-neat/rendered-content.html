<p>It’s been a while – and a team name change - but another one of my
teammates has made the leap into the blogosphere. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon">John
Evdemon</a> is a member of our vertical
industry architecture team focusing on near and long term web service
solutions as well as regulatory compliance solutions. Furthermore, he’s
a co-chair of the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsbpel">OASIS BPEL
TC</a>.
He <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2004/06/09/152347.aspx">blogged a
presentation</a>
on BPEL he did at SD West.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/Rss.aspx">Subscribed</a> and added to my
list of <a href="http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx">Architecture Strategy and Evangelist
Blogs</a></p>
<p>Actually, this isn’t John’s first foray into blogging – he’s got a
personal blog  <a href="http://www.xmlhacker.org/blogs/">&lt;Well-Formed/&gt;</a>.
There, he describes himself as “an XML hacker and standards geek for a
large software vendor.” Always nice to have a standards geek
around…Plus, he’s a big Hitchcock (his new blog is named “Vertigo”). Do
I feel a Hitch movie marathon coming on?</p>
