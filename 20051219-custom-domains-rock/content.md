I’m digging the new [Custom Domains](http://domains.live.com/) service
from [Windows Live](http://www.live.com/). Setup couldn’t have been
smoother:

-   Sign up on Custom Domains
-   Change the MX record of my domain
-   Add Users

The only even slightly tricky point is that I had set up a passport for
<devhawk@outlook.com> in the distant past and long forgotten the password.
However, Custom Domains allows be to “evict” a user from the domain so I
was able to recreate it with little trouble.

I do have two feature requests that I’m guessing are on the horizon for
the [Custom Domains team](http://spaces.msn.com/members/customdomains/):

-   Aliases: I’d like to set up “<webmaster@devhawk.net>” to simply
    forward to my main devhawk email. This is a pretty common feature of
    other email systems, so I expect some future release will include
    this.
-   Non-Web Client Access: I can use Outlook to access my personal
    hotmail account, but I had issues accessing my devhawk email.
