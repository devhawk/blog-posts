<p>Wireless access has been available, but time has not. I’ve at least
caught up on my DevHawk email. David Miles ported my <a href="prj_pagelayoutctl.aspx">Page Layout
UserControl</a> project to VB. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/NUnitAddin/">Jamie
Cansdale</a> made
<a href="prj_messenger.aspx">Messenger.NET</a> into a <a href="http://www.managedaddins.net/gallery/">VS.NET
addin</a>. And George Datuashvili
and <a href="http://www.douglasp.com/">Doug Purdy</a> both pointed out that the
example XML in my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/06/26/xml-schema-doesnt-need-inheritance/">XML Schema Doesn’t Need
Inheritance</a>
entry is nondeterministic. I’ve got quite a backlog, but I will get
though it later this week.</p>
