Wireless access has been available, but time has not. I’ve at least
caught up on my DevHawk email. David Miles ported my [Page Layout
UserControl](prj_pagelayoutctl.aspx) project to VB. [Jamie
Cansdale](http://weblogs.asp.net/NUnitAddin/) made
[Messenger.NET](prj_messenger.aspx) into a [VS.NET
addin](http://www.managedaddins.net/gallery/). And George Datuashvili
and [Doug Purdy](http://www.douglasp.com/) both pointed out that the
example XML in my [XML Schema Doesn’t Need
Inheritance](http://devhawk.net/2003/06/26/xml-schema-doesnt-need-inheritance/)
entry is nondeterministic. I’ve got quite a backlog, but I will get
though it later this week.
