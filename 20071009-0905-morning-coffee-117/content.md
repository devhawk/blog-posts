-   Quick update to the DevHawk 2007 World Tour: I won’t be making it to
    the [SOA & BP Conference](http://www.mssoaandbpconference.com/).
    Riley’s having her tonsils out. As much as I’d like to hang with my
    geek peeps, family is the priority. But I can still make an evening
    event or geek dinner later in the week if anyone is game.
-   Caps season-opening winning streak
    [continues](http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20072008/GS020036.HTM).
    Still 100% on the PK, though the [power play is pretty
    anemic](http://japersrink.blogspot.com/2007/10/early-power-outage-no-cause-for.html).
    As I said yesterday, it’s WAAAAY to early in the season to start
    bragging, but starting strong is much better than starting weak.
-   Speaking of hockey, looks like the [NHL Network is
    launching](http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117973647.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&nid=2562)
    in the US this month (it’s been available in Canada since 2001).
    Also, [NHL.tv](http://www.nhl.tv/) is up and running. Those wishing
    to see Caps highlights can go directly to
    [Capitals.NHL.tv](http://Capitals.NHL.tv). Unfortunately, if you
    want to see full games, you’ve got to subscribe to [Center
    Ice](http://www.indemand.com/sports/nhl/) or [Center Ice
    Online](http://www.nhl.com/nhlhq/centerice_online.html) to the tune
    of \$150. But I don’t want to get “up to 40 games each week”, I just
    want the Caps games. Between the time zone difference and kids, it’s
    not like I have time to watch that much hockey anyway. Why can’t I
    subscribe to just the Caps games online for say \$25 a season?
-   Finished [Halo 3](http://www.xbox.com/games/halo3) Sunday night. Fun
    game and a great end of the trilogy. Looking forward to what the
    [newly-independent](http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=news&cid=12835)
    Bungie does next. Something tells me we haven’t seen the last of
    Master Chief. However, I do think
    [Bioshock](http://www.xbox.com/games/bioshock) has better and more
    original storytelling. [Mass
    Effect](http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect/) looks like it’ll be
    better still.
-   Sam Gentile [pointed
    out](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/09/26/wcf-soa-tips-from-neudesic-dave-pallmann.aspx)
    that his Neudesic colleague David Pallmann has posted a [series of
    WCF
    tips](http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/?_c11_BlogPart_BlogPart=blogview&_c=BlogPart&partqs=cat%3dWCF).
    Several of them are right on the money like “[Take Advantage of One
    Way
    Operations](http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!257.entry)”
    and “[Use a Discovery Mechanism to Locate
    Services](http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!261.entry)“.
    However, I can’t agree with “[Maintain a Service
    Catalog](http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!257.entry)“.
    David warns that if you don’t, “The left hand won’t know what the
    right hand is doing.” Of course, that’s probably the case regardless
    of how you maintain your service catalog. And “[Retry on minor
    failures](http://davidpallmann.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E95EF9DC3FDB978E!263.entry)“?
    That’s fine, if you’ve got an
    [idempotent](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/idempotent)
    operation. Unfortunately, most non-read operations aren’t idempotent
    unless you take the time to design them that way. And most people
    don’t.
-   Speaking of Sam, he’s [blown up his CodeBetter
    blog](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/10/06/goodbye-codebetter-and-alt-net.aspx)
    and [walked away from the ALT.NET
    crowd](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/10/07/codebetter-and-alt-net-the-short-version.aspx).
    I’ve [not been a
    fan](http://devhawk.net/2007/06/13/morning-coffee-89/) of this
    ALT.NET stuff since it surfaced – as Sam said, “ALT.NET is a
    divisive thing” – so I’m happy to see my good friend walk away from
    it.
-   Speaking of ALT.NET, Scott Hanselman blogged about [previewing the
    new ASP.NET MVC
    Framework](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottGuMVCPresentationAndScottHaScreencastFromALTNETConference.aspx)
    at the ALT.NET conference. Like Sam, Scott thinks the term ALT.NET
    is “too polarizing”. I like Scott’s suggestion for Pragmatic.NET.
    Oh, and the MVC framework stuff looks cool too.
-   Reading [Dare’s description of
    OAuth](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/10/06/OAuth10IsHereDelegatedAuthorityComesToMashups.aspx)
    gave me a [distinct sensation of
    deja-vu](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-NET-My-Services-Specification/dp/073561556X).
