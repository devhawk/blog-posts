    "content": "Ahh but to continue the conversation.  just reducing the middle finger would be a cultural thing. (while it is mostly known world wide what it means) \n\nIn the Ukraine maybe Russia also??   the thumb between the index and middle finger has the same meaning.\n\nin the Middle East for us UT fans would be rude to display the hook em horns as it has that meaning there. \n\nOf course there are also the other Gestures you would have to account for, in England (I believe) the thumb to the nose has simuliar(sp) connotations.\n\nOh well;)  more food for thought. don't hate me too much when the conversation starts back up:)\n ",
