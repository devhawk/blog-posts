-   I finished [Mass Effect](http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect) last
    night. I definitely need to play thru that one again, though I’ll
    probably wait until the new [Bring Down the
    Sky](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/marketplace/m/masseffect/bringdownthesky.htm)
    DLC ships next month.
-   Caps [won
    again](http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=Recap&gameNumber=814&season=20072008&gameType=2)
    last night, improving to 20-10-4 since changing coaches at
    Thanksgiving. They’re now at 57 points, taking the lead in the SE
    division with a full game on Carolina, Atlanta and Florida. Still a
    ways to go – 27 games left in the regular season – and things are
    far from “sewn up” but we’re a damn sight better off than we were in
    November.
-   Speaking of a horserace, looks like Clinton and Obama are in one
    after Super Tuesday. Their [estimated delegate
    counts](http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/02/your_election_central_delegate.php)
    are basically tied. On the other side of the aisle, McCain [opened
    up](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23019759/) what is probably
    insurmountable lead – even though he has the [right-wing media
    stars](http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN0628190220080207)
    and [Christian
    leaders](http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=53743)
    against him. Money quote of the day:

-   Charlie Calvert is starting a new series on the future of C\#. First
    up: [Dynamic
    Lookup](http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/01/25/future-focus.aspx).
    Probably most interesting is the news that the DLR “will be the
    infrastructure on which the C\# team implements dynamic lookup”.
    Does this mean C\# will target the DLR? Sure sounds like it. I think
    it’s a good addition, but I’m not a fan of the proposed syntax. (via
    [Bitter
    Coder](http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,6525b1f4-42a1-4961-a96c-09aa523bd8c0.aspx))
-   Brian McNamara saw me present @ LangNET and sent me a link to [his
    blog](http://lorgonblog.spaces.live.com/). He’s building up a
    monadic parser combinator library in C\# 3.0. This is basically the
    same concept that [FParsec](http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/)
    implements, though C\#’s syntax is much less attractive than F\#’s
    for this kind of code. However, Brian does a very good job
    explaining why monadic parser combinators are useful and making the
    idea accessible to the C\# programmer (i.e. you don’t have to learn
    F\# or Haskell to understand what he’s talking about). He also
    points to Luke Hoban’s [C\# 3.0 monadic parser
    implementation](http://blogs.msdn.com/lukeh/archive/2007/08/19/monadic-parser-combinators-using-c-3-0.aspx).
