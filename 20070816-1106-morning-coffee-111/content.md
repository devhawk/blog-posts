-   I’m not sure if I should laugh or cry at Nick Malik’s definition of
    [politecture](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/08/14/politecture.aspx).
    I mean, it’s funny so I’m laughing, but it’s so true that it makes
    me want to cry.

    on retiring the tenets. It’s good to see him say “please God tell me
    we can do better” than CLR interfaces or WSDL.
-   Looks like the P2P APIs are finally [getting the managed
    treatment](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/09/Networking/default.aspx)
    in .NET FX 3.5. A long time ago, [John
    deVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/) asked me what an
    enterprise system like CRM might look like if it used a peer-to-peer
    approach instead of client-server. If I had any free time, I’d
    prototype one out on this API. (via [Mike
    Taulty](http://mtaulty.com/CommunityServer/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/archive/2007/08/09/9574.aspx))
-   Scott Guthrie goes back to his LINQ to SQL series to [tackle Stored
    Procs and
    UDFs](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/08/16/linq-to-sql-part-6-retrieving-data-using-stored-procedures.aspx).
    Being able to use UDFs inline with LINQ queries is very cool.
    However, it seems to me that LINQ discourages the use of stored
    procs. As a developer, I’d rather write LINQ queries than stored
    procs, if I can. The probably puts me at odds with DBAs who’d rather
    all DB access be via stored procs they control.

    about new MSBuild enhancements in VS08:
    [multi-targeting](http://blogs.msdn.com/msbuild/archive/2006/11/15/multi-targeting-how-does-it-work.aspx)
    and [parallel

-   I just discovered [Vista Battery
    Saver](http://www.codeplex.com/vistabattery). Basically, it turns
    off Aero and Sidebar when you’re on battery. I’m traveling to
    Chicago next week, so we’ll see if it has much impact on my battery
    life. (via [Plenty of
