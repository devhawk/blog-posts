I guess it’s not surprising that the owner of the Dallas Mavericks sides
with the owners. But he brings up an interesting point – the players are
giving up money that they will never get back. And it’s more than a
billion – the final league proposal was for each team to pay a maximum
of \$44.7 Million. Times 30 teams equals *ONE AND A THIRD BILLION
DOLLARS*.

Even the league’s Feb 2nd proposal, which the players dismissed out of
hand, guaranteed the players would receive a minimum of 53% of league
reveues. Assuming \$2.1 billion in revenue – which obviously the league
won’t get back to for a long time – means the players would have
received over \$1.1 billion dollars.

The players have short careers (I think the average is four years) and
are losing much more by not playing than the owners are. Even if you
don’t believe the owners are losing less by not playing, I can’t imagine
anyone believes the owners were making money hand over fist – i.e. the
way the players are. How much common sense does it take for the players
to realize the gravy train is over and forcing the owners to lock them
out isn’t going to change that fact?
