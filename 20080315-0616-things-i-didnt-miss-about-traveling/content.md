In my MSIT role, I only made two business trips, a training session with
Thomas Erl and Tech Ed last year. I did travel for two presentations
last fall, but both of those were on the conference’s dime, not
Microsoft’s.

In other words, even though I haven’t even [officially started on the
Dynamic Languages
team](http://devhawk.net/2008/03/11/joining-the-dynamic-languages-team/)
yet, by going to [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org/2008/about/) this weekend
I’ve already halfway to matching my total Microsoft sponsored travel of
the past eighteen months. I used to travel all the time – the architect
evangelist role I was in when I [started this
blog](http://devhawk.net/2003/01/14/new-and-improved-devhawk/) had
about 35-40% travel. But boy I am rusty. Well, rusty maybe isn’t the
term, but I had forgotten how much of a pain it is to travel:

-   When I got to SeaTac Thursday, the Alaska Air desk was mobbed but
    everyone was just standing around waiting. Their computers had
    crashed and they were waiting for them to come back up. I asked an
    Alaska Air employee what the back up plan was, you know in case the
    computers didn’t come back up. “None” was the response. \<sigh\> I
    (and everyone else) ended up wasting a good half an hour before the
    system was operational.
-   My flight was around 30 minutes late taking off and we had to circle
    Chicago O’Hare for a good 30 minutes before we could land. Plus it
    took 15 minutes for them to get the cabin door open.
-   Internet service at the conference and my hotel has been pretty
    iffy. I’m not surprised by problematic wireless access at a
    conference (though it was greatly improved by the end of day one),
    but I wasn’t expecting hardline access in my room to be so bad.
    Speed has been pitiful when it worked at all. I called tech support
    (after the hotel staff uselessly sent up an “engineer” with a
    network cable) and waited on hold 30 minutes before giving up and
    leaving me a message. They called me back literally 3 hours later,
    by then it was after midnight. I was still up since I’m on west
    coast time, but come on!

Once I actually got here, the conference has been great (specifics on
that in a future blog post). A lot more stuff than I’d like is going
over my head so far, since I don’t have a grounding in Python’s language
model yet. But getting to meet folks and chat face to face is the most
important reason for going to these conferences in person – most of the
presentation content will end up online anyway. I’m also getting to hang
out with my new team – we all went for Chicago style deep dish Pizza
last night. I think I’m going to fit in just great with them.

However, there’s one other *huge* difference between traveling now
compared to traveling “back then”: I didn’t have kids before. Leaving my
wife behind was hard enough. Leaving behind my kids as well is even
harder. Explaining to Patrick and Riley that “Daddy has a business trip”
and so I won’t be around for the weekend as usual was exactly no fun.
I’m taking a few days off in the job transition to make up for it.
Hopefully, I’ll be able to bring the family along on a few trips in the
future, [like I did for
DevTeach](http://devhawk.net/2007/09/04/the-devhawk-2007-world-tour/).
[OSCON](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/oscon2008/), for example, has
been in Portland five years – that’s just a few hour drive from Redmond.

But maybe I should wait until I *officially* start the new job before
planning my next trip.
