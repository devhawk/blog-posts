an interesting piece on if businesspeople are begging for SOA. It
isÂ fascinating because I believe that SOA should come from the
business, not because of the delivery mechanism, but because of the
results. If services will truly make a business more adaptable and
responsive to change shouldnâ€™t all business people desire those
results? At the same time they donâ€™t care how that end is achieved,
just that it is. Thatâ€™s where we in the IT industry need to do a
better job of working out the details amongst ourselves and show the
business how SOA can benefit them. Once we do that we should see
more SOA adoptions go smoother and real ROI can be seen.</li>

the myth of youth being the ones that use instant messaging, publish
and read blogs, participate in social networks, etc. I agree that
the technology has been integrated into every layer of society. If
you have ever been at the airport or at a
<a href="http://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a> you know what I mean. Who is
it exactly that has a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Technology/story?id=2348779">Crackberry

It seems technology has really become a part of our culture, and
that itâ€™s not just one age group that is adopting the changes.</li>

background in

That being the case I couldnâ€™t ignore the
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/06/05/sun-releases-new-blades/">news</a>
that Sun is releasing new
<a href="http://www.podtech.net/scobleshow/technology/1522/sun-microsystems-releases-new-blades">blades</a>
for the desktop. I had a blade on my desk for several years and it
was really a nice system to use. For those that would bash me since
I work at Microsoft now I will just say that when you support
Solaris boxes, having one on your desk is quite helpful. I donâ€™t
take sides in the Holy War.
