<p>Yesterday’s Morning Coffee was canceled on account of barfing. For all
the gory details (you have been warned), check out <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!3DAECC033B88329C!641.entry">my wife’s
blog</a>.</p>

to the State of the Union were posted as I write this. Dunno why,
but I was expecting more. Maybe this whole Web 2.0 thing <em>is</em>
overblown a bit!

<li>Speaking of the State of the Union, is it just me, or did anyone
else find it odd that the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16770023/">Scooter Libby
trial</a> started the same day?</li>
<li><del>Atlas</del><a href="http://ajax.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47">ASP.NET AJAX
1.0</a> is done. Lots more
on this <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/01/23/asp-net-ajax-1-0-released.aspx">from Scott Guthrie’s
blog</a>.
While I’m not personally that interested in ASP.NET AJAX itself, two
things strike me as interesting in this release. First, we’re
shipping <em>all</em> the code for this. The client side JavaScript
library, the <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/ajaxtoolkit/">Control Toolkit</a>,
even the server-side components. Second, it’s nice to see the
Developer Division shipping something this significant <em>without</em>
waiting for the next release of Visual Studio. Here’s hoping that
both of these two trends continue.</li>

is pretty cool, but it is missing one feature that I needed twice
Tuesday. While embedding images in a post is cake, there doesn’t
seem to be a way to embed non-image files. You know, like the
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/24/DevHawkColorConsoleTraceListener.aspx">ColorConsoleTraceListener
Project</a> or
the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/23/live-search-for-charity/">Live Search for Chartity Search
Providers</a>.
I’m guessing the infrastructure to post images and files would be
identical, but there’s no UI interface for it. I checked out the
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa738906.aspx">WLW SDK
online</a> and
found the
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa738940.aspx">ISmartContent.Files.Add</a>
method, so I’m guessing it’s doable. But there’s no such animal on
the <a href="http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?l=8">Live Gallery</a>. I
wonder why nobody else has built this yet? Is this really that
unique a request?</li>
</ul>
