<p>As I mentioned in my last post, I have a new toy – a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devices/devicedisplay.aspx?module=deviceDisplay;Smartphone;americas;134">Motorola MPx220
smartphone</a>.
I’m actually lucky enough to have recently laid my hands on two
smartphones. The other was a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devices/devicedisplay.aspx?module=deviceDisplay;Smartphone;apac;58">dopod
515</a>
which was a gift from the organizers of TechEd Beijing. The dopod is
nice, but I really dig the MPx220. I’m partial to flip phones, plus the
MPx220 has a camera and Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the benefits of having a smartphone is the ability to
write some custom stuff for it. There are a variety of
<a href="http://midnight.modaco.com/?page=tweaks">tweaks</a> available that are
predicated on registry modifications. There’s a <a href="http://www.phm.lu/Products/Smartphone/RegEdit/">registry
editor</a> for Smartphone
2002, but I couldn’t get it to install on since my phone is running
Windows Mobile 2003. Luckily, there’s
<a href="http://opennetcf.org/CategoryView.aspx?category=Home">OpenNETCF.org</a>
with a wide variety of <a href="http://opennetcf.org/library/">useful libraries</a>
for compact framework development. They even have registry editing
libraries that work from the
<a href="http://opennetcf.org/library/OpenNETCF.Win32.Registry.html">device</a> or
the
<a href="http://opennetcf.org/library/OpenNETCF.Desktop.Communication.CERegistry.html">desktop</a>.
Not sure what else I want to write yet other than an app to download
movie times a la the new <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/11/08/movie-times-on-your-spot-watch/">SPOT watch movies
channel</a>,
but I’m sure I can think of something!</p>
