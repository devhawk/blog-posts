<p>After the first two days left me in a daze, I’ve been taking it as easy
as I can. Most of my time during the day has been spent in the cabaña
where the couches are <em>very</em> comfy. Of course, time in the cabaña isn’t
exactly “taking it easy” – we may have less traffic than the Dev and
Office cabañas on either side, but there are still lots of attendees to
sit down and chat about architecture with. I’ve had several fascinating
discussions about SOAP-enabling building control systems (HVAC, Access
control, lighting, etc) with the chair of the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=obix">Open Building Information
Exchange (oBIX) OASIS Technical
Committee</a>.</p>
<p>Tuesday night was laid back – dinner @ the hotel pub and a relatively
early night. Last night I went to the Office party @ the Hard Rock Cafe.
There were a bunch of guys who had come to the Road Rally on Sunday so
we hung out for quite a while drinking and talking architecture. Tonight
is the big attendee party @ Sea World. I assume it will be much like the
attendee party @ PDC – mostly drinking beer and talking w/ other
attendees.</p>
<p>My final presentation is in 45 minutes as I type this – Data in Service
Oriented Architecture. So far, my scores for the sessions I did Monday
are pretty good. The Metropolis overview scored ~7.6 out of 9 and the
Metropolis Discussion a ~6.8. These keep changing since the eval
systems stay open until the end of the conference. Given the craziness
with the last-minute speaker change, I’m OK with those scores. They give
us access to all the anonymous raw scores and comments which is great
for improving my performance in later sessions. For example, apparently
I spoke too fast on Monday (hey, I was nervous!) so I’ll be specifically
working on that today.</p>
<p>Of course, you can’t keep everyone happy all the time. A few members
commented that they didn’t like the Metropolis analogy. Apparently,
someone who didn’t like the Metropolis Overview also showed up for the
Metropolis Discussion, still didn’t like it and commented we should “get
off” the analogy. Why you would show up for the discussion if you didn’t
like the overview? I’ve also seen several comments that the Architecture
track has no code. Not sure how to address that since the lack of code
is by design! Of course, such growing pains are to be expected for our
first time at TechEd.</p>
