In addition to being a history buff and architecture expert,
[Pat](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland) likes to sing – typically parody
songs of his own creation. He’s written many, but we actually broke down
and got a license for [Don McLean’s](http://www.don-mclean.com/) classic
“[American Pie](http://www.don-mclean.com/americanpie.asp)“. Pat
performed his version – a speculative retrospective titled “Mr. CIO Guy”
– at the end of his [TechEd
Europe](http://www.microsoft.com/europe/teched/) architecture track
general session. You can watch a [streaming
version](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=11950) on
[Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/). Lyrics are
[posted](http://blogs.msdn.com/devhawk/articles/171123.aspx) on my MSDN
Blog. Major thanks to [Breakfast of Champions](http://www.bofc.com/) for
getting it encoded so fast and to [Jeff](http://www.jeffsandquist.com/)
for getting it posted so fast. 

On a more serious note, we are recording all of [Pat’s TechEd
sessions](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2004/06/18/159345.aspx)
for the [Architecture Strategy
Series](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series). Watch
this space for details.
