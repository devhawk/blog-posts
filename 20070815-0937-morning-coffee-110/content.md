-   Monday @ [Gamefest](http://www.xnagamefest.com/), the XNA team
    [announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/08/13/announcing-xna-game-studio-2-0.aspx)
    XNA Game Studio 2.0. The two big new things are support for the
    entire VS product line (1.0 only works on VC\# Express) and the
    addition of networking APIs. Let’s Kill Dave [has a good
    wrapup](http://letskilldave.com/archive/2007/08/13/gamefest-quick-summary-day-1.aspx)
    of the announcements from Gamefest Day One.
-   Speaking of Xbox 360, I played thru the demos of
    [Stranglehold](http://www.xbox.com/games/johnwoopresentsstranglehold/)
    and [Bioshock](http://www.xbox.com/games/bioshock). Two thumbs up on
    both. It’s gonna be an expensive year for Xbox gamers.
-   Mark Cuban [noodles
    on](http://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/08/13/solution-for-the-real-estate-market-take-your-house-public/)
    taking your house public. “Why not create a market or exchange where
    homeowners can sell equity in their homes?” I’ve thought about this
    myself from time to time. However, Mark thinks making it happen
    would “probably take the country’s biggest banks working together”.
    I wonder if there’s a more Web 2.0 [social
    lending](http://www.centernetworks.com/social-lending-web-2-0)
    approach that would work better.
-   Jeff Atwood calls virtualization as “the next great frontier for
    computer security”. I agree 100%. But I don’t think the action is
    going to be in “full-machine” virtualization like Virtual PC.
    Rather, it’s going to be sandbox virtualization. Jeff mentions
    GreenBorder (now [part of
    Google](http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=241)) but it’s not the
    only solution. Some time ago, Microsoft acquired
    [SoftGrid](http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/softgrid/default.mspx)
    which uses sandbox virtualization for application deployment, but
    using
    [SystemGuard](http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/softgrid/evaluation/virtualization.mspx)
    for security sandboxing seems like a logical step.
-   The WCF LOB Adapter SDK has released. Sonu Arora [has the
    details](http://blogs.msdn.com/sonuarora/archive/2007/08/08/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk-is-now-generally-available-for-download.aspx).
    As part of the Integration team @ MSIT, I have a feeling we’re going
    to become fairly familiar with this technology. (via [Jesus
    Rodriguez](http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/08/09/wcf-lob-adapters-sdk-is-available-for-download.aspx)).
-   Speaking of Jesus, he
    [thinks](http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/08/13/sca-committees.aspx)
    the [six new SCA4SOA
    committees](http://www.oasis-open.org/news/oasis-news-2007-08-09.php)
    are “going to help”. Why? Because inventing technology in committee
    has turned out so well in the past?
-   John deVadoss cements BPM’s fad du jour status by
    [contrasting](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/archive/2007/08/08/big-bpm-vs-little-bpm.aspx)
    “big” BPM and “little” BPM. It’s fairly obvious to me that
    big \*anything\* just doesn’t work in the enterprise. But I worry
    that little \*anything\* doesn’t work that well either. So how long
    until someone ([probably
    Nick](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/07/21/what-you-need-to-make-middle-out-soa-architecture-work.aspx))
    starts arguing for “middle out” BPM?
-   David Bressler
    [wonders](http://blogs.progress.com/soa_infrastructure/2007/08/thank-you-scott.html)
    “What is it about registries that everyone thinks is a panacea for
    all things SOA?” Amen, Brother! Joe McKendrick
    [claims](http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=937) it’s
    required for governance, but then gets to what I think is
    the \*real\* reason for focus on registries: the “registry is a
    tangible offering” that vendors can sell. Just because it’s
    productizable doesn’t mean you need it.
-   Hartmut Wilms
    [responds](http://www.innoq.com/blog/hw/2007/08/14/retire_the_tenets.html)
    to my [retire the
    tenets](http://devhawk.net/2007/08/13/retire-the-tenets/) post,
    but he seems to contradict himself. On the one hand, he suggests
    that “the four tenets just expressed, what “almost” everybody
    outside the MS world knew already”. But then he goes on to dispute
    that the SO paradigm shift has even occurred! Hartmut, I’ll grant
    you that WCF (among other similar stacks) are way too focused on
    “you write the classes, we’ll handle the contracts and messages”. On
    the other hand, if you don’t provide a productive interface that
    most everyone can pick up and run with, the technology won’t get
    adopted in the first place.
