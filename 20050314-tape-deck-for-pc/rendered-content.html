<p>Back in college, I used to DJ for <a href="http://kscr.org/">KSCR</a>, USC’s
student run radio station. I’ve got a bunch of old cassette of my
“work”. Now, with the
<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/drives/6908/">PlusDeck</a>, I could
actually install a tape deck in a free 5.25″ drive bay of my home
computer. But for $150, I think I’d rather just plug my old tape deck
from the garage into the sound card.</p>
