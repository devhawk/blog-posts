A few people [took
issue](http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,1a9e0102-c263-4226-b1cb-e076c94cf6bc.aspx)
with me calling [Dennis Miller a partisan
hack](http://devhawk.net/2006/02/11/dennis-miller-has-jumped-the-shark/) while
also expressing relief that the new season of [Real Time with Bill
Maher](http://www.hbo.com/billmaher) was starting. I finally got to
watch [last Friday’s
episode](http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/episode/2006_02_17_ep67.html).
Sure, they made fun of Dick Cheney’s hunting accident and had a round of
negative things to say about this administrations handling of Iraq (one
of the guests was [Dan
Senor](http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/senor-bio.html), Advisor to
the U.S. Presidential Envoy in Iraq) but he also grilled Democratic
[Senator Russ Feingold](http://www.russfeingold.org/) on the
effectiveness of [campain finance
reform](http://www.russfeingold.org/cfr.php) and came out as
pro-wiretapping:

Seems like quite a difference to Dennis Miller calling out John Kerry
and Howard Dean a year after the election and having nothing at all
negative to say about the Bush administration.

Out of curiosity, I’m wondering what people think of Jon Stewart of [The
Daily
Show](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml)
fame. Partisan Hack or Not?
