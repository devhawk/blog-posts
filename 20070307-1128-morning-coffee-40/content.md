-   My boss let me borrow a Tecra M4 that he scavenged from his boss.
    The display is fairly twitchy, I think it’s a motherboard issue. But
    it’s very intermittent and I’ll get help desk to take a look. In the
    meantime, it sure is nice to driving a Tablet PC again. And it’s
    Vista ready to boot.
-   Speaking of Vista, Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 Update for
    Windows Vista. It’s a mouthful but it’s [now
    available](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=90E2942D-3AD1-4873-A2EE-4ACC0AACE5B6&displaylang=en).

-   The DSL tools team keeps on rolling with the power toys. First it
    was the [Designer Integration
    PowerToy](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bfba74af-4f28-44cc-8de5-0c3c55d21863&displaylang=en),
    now it’s the [DSL Tree Grid Editor
    PowerToy](http://www.codeplex.com/dsltreegrideditor). Jeff Santos
    [has the
    details](http://blogs.msdn.com/jezzsa/archive/2007/03/01/dsl-user-experience-powertoy.aspx).
-   I missed the TechFest keynote yesterday, but it’s [available on
    demand](http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/). They also have
    [descriptions](http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/demos.aspx)
    and
    [videos](http://research.microsoft.com/techfest/videos/default.aspx) of
    some of the technologies on display. (well, only one video so far,
    but I assume since the page is labeled “TechFest 2007 Videos” that
    more are on the way.)
-   There’s new support for integrating WCF and WF coming in VS “Orcas”.
    Moustafa Khalil Ahmed [has the
    details](http://blogs.msdn.com/moustafa/archive/2007/03/04/visual-studio-orcasand-wf-wcf-rules-changes.aspx)
    on what’s new for WF & WCF in the latest CTP drop. For me
    personally, the WCF/WF integration is some of the most important
    stuff coming in Orcas, second only to LINQ.
