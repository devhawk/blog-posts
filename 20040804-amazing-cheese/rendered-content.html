<p>I’ve <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/12/19/when-youre-really-into-cheese/">blogged about
cheese</a>
before, but it was in jest. However, the cheese here in Australia and
New Zealand has been awesome. It’s like going to Tahiti and eating
pineapple. When you come home to the same old stuff, it’s a real let
down. Maybe I need to stop making fun of my coworker Earnie (he’s the
one who showed me the American Cheese Society annual conference and
awards).</p>
