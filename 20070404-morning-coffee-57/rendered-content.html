<li>Scott Hanselman’s post on <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProgrammersKeepYourWitsAboutYouAndCodeMindfully.aspx">Mindful
Coding</a>
reminded me of the practice of
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking">rubberducking</a>. The basic
idea is that when you’re stuck on a problem, you explain it out loud
to an inanimate object – aka the rubber duck. (though when I
originally heard about this practice, it was a teddy bear.) Maybe
instgead of Coding Mindfully, we should be Coding Out Loud?</li>
<li>Quick side note to the previous bullet: I have often worked thru a
problem by explaining it to <a href="http://techiewife.spaces.life.com">my
wife</a> who, like Scott’s wife,
nods in all the right places, but cares not about such things. But
calling your wife a rubber duck is bad for your health, so I’d
rather call it Coding Out Loud.</li>
<li>I’m a couple weeks behind on this, but Microsoft along with BEA,
BMC, Cisco, Dell, EMC, HP, IBM, Intel, and Sun
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2007/01/">submitted</a> the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/business/dsi/serviceml.mspx">Service
Modeling
Language</a> to
the W3C. For those not plauing along at home, SML is the new name
for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/business/dsi/sdmwp.mspx">System Definition
Model</a> and is a
core deliverable of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/business/dsi/">Dynamic System
Initiative</a>. Good to see
it’s gotten such broad support for this.</li>
<li>Jezz Santos and Edward Baker wrote a series of posts entitled
“<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jezzsa/archive/2007/01/25/factories-201.aspx">Factories
201</a>“.
The entire series is good, but I particularly liked Jezz’ post <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jezzsa/archive/2007/02/02/factories-201-how-long-will-it-take.aspx">How
Long Will It
Take?</a> His
rough estimate is that it takes at least five products built with a
software factory before you recoup your investment in building the
factory itself. Sounds like a fair assumption.</li>
