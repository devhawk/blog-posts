<li>On a recommendation from my mother-in-law, I’ve been watching
<a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/262/index.jsp">Torchwood</a>. Sort
of Men in Black, the series and set in Cardiff. Since it’s made in
England, it’ll be one of the few shows still running in the new year
due to the WGA strike.</li>
<li>A while back I pointed out that many DotNetKicks articles <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/01/31/morning-coffee-21/">were
submitted by their
authors</a>. I
submitted a <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/01/morning-coffee-22/">few of my
own</a>, just for
kicks (har har), with <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/02/02/morning-coffee-23/">mixed
results</a>.
Today, I discovered that the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/11/practical-f-parsing-the-parse-buffer/">parse buffer
post</a>
from my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/10/practical-parsing-in-f/">Practical Parsing in
F#</a>
series was
<a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/other/Practical_F_Parsing_Part_1_the_Parse_Buffer">submitted</a>,
picked up some kicks, and made it to the home page. That’s pretty
cool. I guess writing more dev-focused articles is the way to go to
get attention on DNK.</li>
<li>Amazon has rolled out a limited beta of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=342335011&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">SimpleDB</a>,
which appears to be
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/S3-AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16427261&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">S3</a> +
query support. Cost is based on usage: 14¢/hour for machine
utilization, 10¢/GB upload, 13-18¢/GB download and $1.50/GB
storage/month. I’d love to see SimpleDB software that I could
download and install, rather than hosted only. Even if I was going
to use the hosted service, I’d like to develop against a non-hosted
instance.</li>
<li>Research for sale! I was checking out the MS Research download feed
and discovered a link to the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/msagl">Automatic Graph
Layout</a> (MSAGL)
library. This was previously called GLEE (Graph Layout Execution
Engine) and was “free for non-commercial use”. Now, you can buy it
for $295 <a href="http://www.windowsmarketplace.com/details.aspx?view=info&amp;itemid=6002737">from Windows
Marketplace</a>
(though the previous free version is <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/Details/0bbe180c-93c8-43f0-80fb-96e20d85a573/Details.aspx?0sr=d">still
available</a>).
The idea of directly commercializing research like this strikes me
as pretty unusual. It must be a really good library.</li>
<li>Scott Guthrie <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/14/new-asp-net-dynamic-data-support.aspx">shows
off</a>
the new Dynamic Data Support that will ship as part of the ASP.NET
Extensions. I’m like, whatever. Scaffolding wasn’t that that
interesting to me in RoR, so it’s no surprise that it’s not that
interesting in ASP.NET.</li>
