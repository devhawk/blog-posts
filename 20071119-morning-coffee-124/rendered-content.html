<li>While my blog was down last week, I finally finished <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/gearsofwar/">Gears of
War</a>. I played thru on
hardcore, but had to throttle back to casual to beat the last boss.
I’d like to try and finish on hardcore, but I’ve moved on to <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/deadrising/">Dead
Rising</a> – another game from
last year I never had time to finish. I’m almost done the main play
mode, though I understand there are other play modes that get
unlocked when you finish it.</li>
<li>I’m forbidden from buying any new games before Christmas, so <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/masseffect">Mass
Effect</a>, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/assassinscreed/">Assassin’s
Creed</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/orangebox/">The Orange
Box</a> will have to wait. My
next game will either be <a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/bluedragonxbox360/">Blue
Dragon</a>, which a
friend let me borrow, or
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/games/tomclancyrainbowsixvegas/">R6:Vegas</a>, yet
another (but the last) game from last year I never got time to play.</li>
<li>I’ll skip the “giving thanks” jokes and point out that <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/products/bb931214.aspx">Visual
Studio
2008</a>
and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&amp;displaylang=en">.NET FX
3.5</a>
have shipped.  Soma has the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-net-framework-3-5-shipped.aspx">announcement</a>
and both <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-net-3-5-released.aspx">Scott
Guthrie</a>
and <a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-rtm-available-on-msdn-subscriber-downloads.aspx">Sam
Gentile</a>
summarize what’s new. The Express editions are available from the
new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/default.aspx">Express Developer
Center</a>. The VS SDK
doesn’t appear to be released yet, but I’m sure it will be along in
due course.</li>
<li>Speaking of VS SDK, CoDe Magazine did an <a href="http://code-magazine.com/focus/vsx/">entire
issue</a> on VS Extensibility
which you can read online or <a href="http://code-magazine.com/Milos_DocumentManagement_DownloadFileAttachment.aspx?id=7bbfeccf-6167-4912-9c64-a0d984c524d4">download as
PDF</a>.</li>
<li>Nick Malik took a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/19/not-crazy-just-lateral-thinking.aspx">bunch of
heat</a>
back in June for what <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/06/16/Redefining-reality.aspx">some
thought</a>
was a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/15/tools-for-mort.aspx">redefinition of
Mort</a>,
one of the Developer Division personas. Now Paul Vick thinks it’s
time to <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2007/11/14/22589.aspx">retire the Mort
persona</a>,
primarily because of the negative connotation the name carries. His
suggestion for a replacement is Ben (as in Franklin). And did you
notice how similar Paul’s description of Mort is to what Nick
described? I’d say some folks owe Nick an apology.</li>
<li>I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/11/16/afternoon-coffee-123/">said
Friday</a> I
was going to take a closer look @ OpenID and OAuth. There’s an
<a href="http://wiki.openid.net/Introduction">intro to OpenID</a> on <a href="http://wiki.openid.net">their
wiki</a> and Sam Ruby’s <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers">OpenID for
non-SuperUsers</a>
seems to be the canonical source on implementing OpenID on your own
blog. Frankly, reading the OpenID intro reminded me a lot of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Federation_Passive_Requestor_Profile">WS-Federation Passive Requestor
Profile</a>.
Does OpenID have the equivalent of an “active” mode?</li>
<li>Likewise, the <a href="http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/10/beginners-guide.html">Beginner’s Guide to
OAuth</a>
series of posts by Eran Hammer-Lahav is a good intro to OAuth. The
phrase “Jane notices she is now at a Faji page by looking at the
browser URL” from the <a href="http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/10/beginners-gui-1.html">protocol
walkthru</a>
makes me worry that OAuth is vulnerable to phishing. Having one of
the <a href="http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/spec/branches/1.0/drafts/6/spec.html#anchor1">OAuth
authors</a>
call phishing victims
<a href="http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/09/would-you-like-.html">careless</a>
and <a href="http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2007/09/oauth-needs-kar.html">wishing for Karl
Rove</a>
to “scare people into being more careful and smarter about what they
do online” makes me think my fears are well grounded. I’m thinking
maybe OAuth and OpenID aren’t quite ready to <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/11/12/OpenIDOAuthIsTheFinalNailInTheCoffinOfTheWSVsRESTDiscussion.aspx">nail down WS-*’s
coffin</a>.</li>
<li>In researching OpenID, I came across <a href="http://www.edtechpost.ca/wordpress/2007/11/14/openid-wcet-presentation/">this
presentation</a>
hosted on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a>. I had never seen
SlideShare before – it’s kinda like YouTube for presentations.
Sharing basic presentations is kinda lame – there doesn’t appear to
be any animation support, so the slides are basically pictures.
However, they also support
“<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/faqs/slidecast">slidecasting</a>” where you
sync slides to an audio file hosted elsewhere. That I like. I have a
bunch of old decks + audio, maybe I’ll stick them up there.</li>
