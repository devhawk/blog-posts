I’m back home from PyCon, but between digging out my inbox, finishing
transition reports and doing my mid-year career discussion I’m a little
busy. But I did want to point at a couple of recent posts from the [IPy
team blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/ironpython/):

-   [DLR
    Resources](http://blogs.msdn.com/ironpython/archive/2008/03/16/dlr-resources.aspx)
    is a partial list of links to blogs (where’s mine?), mailing lists,
    specs, whitepapers and websites related to DLR, IronRuby and
    IronPython. I especially want to call out [Dynamic
    Silverlight](http://dynamicsilverlight.net/) which not only has lots
    of good information but also looks frakking sweet. Props to my
    so-to-be teammate [Jimmy
    Schementi](http://jimmy.schementi.com/blog/).
-   [Dev and Test Job Openings on IronPython, IronRuby &
    F\#](http://blogs.msdn.com/ironpython/archive/2008/02/25/ironpython-ironruby-and-f-openings-in-dev-test-and-pm.aspx).
    We’re hiring, so if you’re interested in working on language
    development @ MSFT, [drop me a line](mailto:devhawk@outlook.com) and
    I’ll make sure it gets to the right people. BTW, I hear the
    IronPython PM position [has been
    filled](http://devhawk.net/2008/03/11/joining-the-dynamic-languages-team/).
