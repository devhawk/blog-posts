-   Didn’t see
    [that](http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=270080194) coming.
    I guess the Buckeyes didn’t either. Congrats to the Gators. That
    makes at least three championships in a row won by the underdog. For
    all the complaining about the [BCS](http://www.bcsfootball.org/),
    it’s hard to argue they got the champion wrong this year. However,
    with the exception of the [Fiesta
    Bowl](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls06/bowls?game=fiesta), the
    BCS games weren’t very good this year.
-   There’s a
    [video](http://onten.net/Blogs/tina/you-heard-it-people-carbon-is-real/)
    of the new [Xbox 360
    IPTV](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/ces2007/microsoftintegratesiptvsoftwareplatform.htm)
    service up on [10](http://onten.net). I realize it’s a demo and
    we’re nearly a year away from release, but I’m not impressed. Xbox
    360 Fanboy [pointed
    to](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2007/01/09/rumor-xbox-iptv-may-not-be-so-grand/)
    a blogger who got a [deeper look at the
    service](http://thunor.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!71C238B5E0E3724D!149.entry)
    at Microsoft’s CE booth. Frankly, it doesn’t look or sound like it’s
    much different than standard cable service (though I like the sound
    of 35Mbps bandwidth at my house). I realize familiarity is good, but
    do we really have to lock ourselves into the existing TV paradigm?
-   I got roped into a webcast today on [Optimizing Application Platform
    Infrastructure](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032321927&EventCategory=4&culture=en-US&CountryCode=US).
    It’s at 11am Pacific time. Stop by and say hi.
-   My colleague [Dale](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com) has a rant
    about [Service Oriented
    Assholes](http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!271.entry).
    His definition: “Any person or team that pontificates on
    Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) without considering the
    realities of implementing SOA in a real business environment with
    real suppliers, customers, and products. These people are great at
    designing something on a white board or on paper, but couldn’t
    produce a real workable production ready system if their life
    depended on it.” Sort of a more specific (and vulgar) version of
    Joel’s “[Architecture
    Astronauts](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html)“.
    How many SOA-holes do you know?
