<a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=270080194">that</a> coming.
I guess the Buckeyes didn’t either. Congrats to the Gators. That
makes at least three championships in a row won by the underdog. For
all the complaining about the <a href="http://www.bcsfootball.org/">BCS</a>,
it’s hard to argue they got the champion wrong this year. However,
with the exception of the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls06/bowls?game=fiesta">Fiesta
Bowl</a>, the
BCS games weren’t very good this year.</li>
<li>There’s a
<a href="http://onten.net/Blogs/tina/you-heard-it-people-carbon-is-real/">video</a>
of the new <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/events/ces2007/microsoftintegratesiptvsoftwareplatform.htm">Xbox 360
IPTV</a>
service up on <a href="http://onten.net">10</a>. I realize it’s a demo and
we’re nearly a year away from release, but I’m not impressed. Xbox
360 Fanboy <a href="http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2007/01/09/rumor-xbox-iptv-may-not-be-so-grand/">pointed
to</a>
a blogger who got a <a href="http://thunor.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!71C238B5E0E3724D!149.entry">deeper look at the
service</a>
at Microsoft’s CE booth. Frankly, it doesn’t look or sound like it’s
much different than standard cable service (though I like the sound
of 35Mbps bandwidth at my house). I realize familiarity is good, but
do we really have to lock ourselves into the existing TV paradigm?</li>
<li>I got roped into a webcast today on <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032321927&amp;EventCategory=4&amp;culture=en-US&amp;CountryCode=US">Optimizing Application Platform

<li>My colleague <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com">Dale</a> has a rant
about <a href="http://halfmybrain.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!DF6CA820250998D2!271.entry">Service Oriented
Assholes</a>.
His definition: “Any person or team that pontificates on
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) without considering the
realities of implementing SOA in a real business environment with
real suppliers, customers, and products. These people are great at
designing something on a white board or on paper, but couldn’t
produce a real workable production ready system if their life
depended on it.” Sort of a more specific (and vulgar) version of
Joel’s “<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">Architecture
Astronauts</a>“.
How many SOA-holes do you know?</li>
