    "content": "Hi Harry,\n\nYou implied that I could not answer the question, \"How does EA demonstrate value.\"  That is not true.  I can readily answer the question, from my viewpoint, but I chose instead to *ask* the question to see if my answer matches the various answers that I may hear back.  I got a lot of valuable input, both on the blog and on the forum on Shared Insights where I asked the same question.\n\nYou are the ONLY person to reply and say that EA provides no value.  \n\nPerhaps you should read about the role and value of Enterprise Architecture from established sources before you bash the entire profession.\n\nEA is real, my friend.  It is as real as city planning.  The only major city in the US without city planning is Houston.  I have visited a few times, and I can honestly say that without city planning, they are a mess.  \n\nhttp://www.architectureandgovernance.com/articles/12-evolving_role.asp\n\n--- Nick",
