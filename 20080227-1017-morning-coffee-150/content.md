-   Yesterday was the NHL trading deadline, and the Capitals were very
    busy. They obtained [Huet from
    Montreal](http://capitals.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=354907),
    [Federov from
    Columbus](http://capitals.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=354946)
    and [Cooke from
    Vancouver](http://capitals.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=354952).
    Given they are fighting just to make the playoffs, going for three
    soon-to-be unrestricted free agents seems like an odd choice.
    However, the consensus (among my parents anyway) was that it’s
    critical to get this very young Caps team some playoff experience.
    Even if all three walk at season’s end, it’ll be worth if the Caps
    make a playoff run. Besides it’s not like we gave up much: an extra
    second round pick in ’09, a [19 year old defensive
    prospect](http://und.cstv.com/sports/m-hockey/mtt/ruth_teddy00.html)
    (who was apparently *14th* on the depth chart) and an
    [underachieving
    winger](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?playerId=724).
-   Speaking of the Caps playoff chances, they are currently one and a
    half games back of the division leading Hurricanes and two games
    behind the current eighth seed Flyers. Yes, I rank hockey teams
    using baseball’s standings system. Otherwise, you have to talk about
    games in hand (i.e. the Caps are five points behind Carolina with
    two games in hand).
-   The writer’s guild [ratified the new
    contract](http://unitedhollywood.blogspot.com/2008/02/strike-officially-over-contract.html),
    so Hollywood labor strife is now officially behind us. At least
    until July when the the actors may go on strike.
-   It seems like a slow week for Microsoft geek news, which is odd
    since WS08, VS08 and SQL08 all [launch
    today](http://www.microsoft.com/heroeshappenhere/default.mspx). I’m
    guessing it’s the calm before the [Mix](http://www.visitmix.com/)
    storm next week.
-   After [going
    dark](http://blogs.msdn.com/xmlteam/archive/2007/06/05/linq-to-xsd-preview-alpha-0-2-to-go-with-orcas-beta-1.aspx)
    for six months, [Linq to
    XSD](http://blogs.msdn.com/xmlteam/archive/2008/02/21/linq-to-xsd-alpha-0-2.aspx)
    has been re-released to work with the RTM version of VS08. Scott
    Hanselman
    [demonstrates](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LINQToEverythingLINQToXSDAddsMoreLINQiness.aspx)
    Linq to XSD by applying it to [OFX](http://www.ofx.org/), an XML
    Schema he calls “goofy” but apparently helped develop. OFX uses
    [derivation by
    restriction](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#derivation-by-restriction),
    which has no direct corollary in C\#, but Linq to XSD’s  is able to
    translate between XML and objects without loosing any of that type
    fidelity. Nice to know Linq to XSD can tolerate OFX’s level of
    goofiness, though I’m guessing most people use much more
    straightforward schemas.
-   Speaking of Linq, I discovered [LINQPad](http://www.linqpad.net/)
    via a comment on [Rob Conery’s
    blog](http://blog.wekeroad.com/2008/02/27/creating-in-queries-with-linq-to-sql/)
    (which I found [via
    DNK](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/linq/Creating_IN_queries_with_Linq)).
    It’s basically a code snippet IDE for C\# 3.0 and VB9, with it also
    has built in database connection support, so it can fulfil much the
    same role as SQL Management Studio. I only played with it for a few
    minutes, but I was really impressed.  This is definitely going in my
    utilities folder. I wonder if they’re interested in supporting F\#?
-   Not sure how I missed this, but you can get [MSDN
    Magazine](http://windowsclient.net/apps/MsdnReaderSetup.exe) via
    same Syndicated Client Experience as [Architecture
    Journal](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=dd466bbb-1b7d-438e-9f9a-954ce2058f15&displaylang=en).
    Unlike AJ which is divided into issues, the MSDN magazine client is
    divided into topics which is harder to square with the physical
    magazine. On the other hand, since MSDN Mag has been around longer,
    perhaps topics + search is a better discovery mechanism.

    [announces](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/02/27/visual-studio-gallery.aspx)
    the [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.com/), a
    repository of VS Extensions. It’s kinda cool, but the whole
    discovery mechanism is clunky. I might like to experiment with some
    free or even free trial products, but there’s no way to filter on
    cost so finding them is a hassle. Also, there’s no way for community
    members to vote, rate or comment on the products in any way.
-   Nick Malik [can’t answer the
    question](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2008/02/23/enterprise-architecture-earning-our-keep.aspx)
    “how does Enterprise Architecture demonstrate value?” I could be
    snarky and say “it doesn’t”, but that’s only half the answer. It
    doesn’t, but it should. My opinion, since you asked Nick, is that EA
    fails to deliver value because it tries to control the
    uncontrollable. Trying to gain efficiency thru establishing
    standards and eliminating overlap via reuse are pipe dreams, though
    literally millions of \$\$\$ have been poured into those sink-holes.
    There are a few areas where centrally funded infrastructure projects
    can solve big problems that individual projects can’t effectively
    tackle on their own. EA should focus their time there, they can
    actually make a difference. Otherwise, they should stay out of
    project’s way.
