I got interested in computers when my dad started bringing home a
terminal to access his companies mainframe over a 300 baud telecoupled
modem. The first terminals were paper-based, then we moved-on-up to a
VT100. I got interested in programming because I wanted to be able to
build my own game like [Adventure](http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/)
or [Zork](http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html). The rest
as they say is history and some 20-25 years later I work for Microsoft.
I never actually built an adventure game, but if I still wanted to,
apparently [Rory](http://neopoleon.com/blog) is [teaching a
sesson](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/15103.aspx) on
[Inform](http://www.inform-fiction.org) which apparently is a language
for building Interactive Fiction.

Sounds like [Code Camp](http://pacwest.ms/codecamp/pdx/1/) is going to
be a blast. Note to self, bug Rory for his slides.
