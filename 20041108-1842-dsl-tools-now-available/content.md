We announced it last week, but the [DSL Tools home
page](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/teamsystem/workshop/dsltools/)
just went live today. The big thing is the [Microsoft Tools for Domain
Specific Languages Technology
Preview](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=673A0B3A-F631-4310-8599-8BB55D15F017&displaylang=en).
There’s also a [walkthru of the
tool](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/teamsystem/Workshop/DSLTools/walkthrough.aspx),
a
[newsgroup](http://communities.microsoft.com/newsgroups/default.asp?icp=whidbey&slcid=us&NewsGroup=microsoft.private.whidbey.teamsystem.workshop.dsltools)
and [Jochen’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/jochens/). We also published
the [third
article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/softfact3.asp)
in the Software Factories overview series.

The DSL Tools is the first in a collection of [“workshop”
projects](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/teamsystem/Workshop) that
relate to Team System. These projects will be run as transparently as is
feasible, so watch that site to be pretty dynamic as we post things like
specs and lots of interim builds.
[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) has talked in the past of
transparent projects, this I think will be a much more transparent
project than we’ve done in the past.

(BTW, if you want to try out the DSL Tools, you need [VS2005 Beta
1](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/get) as well as the [VSIP SDK
2005 Beta 1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/extend/SDKDownload/))
