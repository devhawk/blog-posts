<p>As expected, my new role is going to involve much more travel than my
old role. Here’s a list of all the places I’m going / have been this
year. I’ll be updating this post periodically as I get tapped for more
presentations. There are several other conferences I’m considering,
submitting sessions for, in discussions with, but these are the ones
that are confirmed.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.devdays.nl">DevDays 2008</a></strong><br />
May 22nd – 23rd, Amsterdam, The Netherlands</p>
<p>This is a kinda last minute pickup. My boss was originally scheduled to
do this. Or should I say, my ex-boss? (I’ve been here less than two
months and already scared off my boss!
😄 I’m doing two talks, but I only have the abstract for one of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DEV315 – “IronPython” and Dynamic Languages on .NET</strong><br />
“IronPython” is the codename for a new implementation of the Python
programming language on the .NET Framework. IronPython is fast—in
fact, up to 1.8 times faster than Python-2.4 on the standard pystone
benchmark. It supports an interactive interpreter with fully dynamic
compilation as well as static compilation to produce pre-compiled
executables. It’s well integrated with the rest of the framework and
makes all .NET libraries easily available to Python programmers. This
session shows how IronPython brings the power of .NET to Python and
the power of Python to .NET. At OSCON 2004, the first public release
of IronPython was announced. This session demonstrates the latest
IronPython version in a range of situations from using GUI frameworks
to driving Microsoft Office applications to working with a variety of
external libraries. We also discuss other scripting languages on .NET.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m also going to do a talk on Dynamic Languages in Web Development,
focused on Silverlight and ASP.NET. I got asked to do a second session
at the last minute (technically, later than the last minute) so this one
has no abstract.</p>

<p><strong>TechEd <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/nz/teched08/index.aspx">New Zealand</a>
and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com.au/teched/default.aspx">Australia</a></strong><br />
Sept 1st – 5th, Auckland, New Zealand and Sydney, Australia </p>
<p>I did TechEd NZ &amp; Australia back in 2004 and had a blast, so I’m looking
forward to coming back this year. Content isn’t locked down yet, but I’m
looking to do both a dynamic languages session as well as an
architecture session. There’s also rumor of a web futures panel
discussion that I’ll be participating in.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/">PDC08</a></strong><br />
Oct 27th – 30th, Los Angeles, California</p>
<p>I’m not doing a session, but I’m helping drive PDC content for my group,
so I’m assuming I’ll be at the conference in some capacity. I’m thinking
we need a dynamic language <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Agenda/UnSessions.aspx#open-space">open space
session</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2008/west2008.aspx">patterns &amp; practices Summit 2008</a></strong><br />
Nov 3rd-7th, Redmond, Washington</p>
<p>I really enjoy p&amp;p Summit because
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kpleas/">Keith</a> lets me experiment with somewhat
off the wall sessions like “Developer 2.0” and “Moving Beyond Industrial
Software”. Frankly, I have NO idea what I’m going to do at this years’
Summit, but I’m looking to stay outside the box like I have in the past.</p>
