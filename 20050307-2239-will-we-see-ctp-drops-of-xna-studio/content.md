[Rob Caron](http://weblogs.asp.net/robcaron/) has the
[scoop](http://weblogs.asp.net/robcaron/archive/2005/03/07/387378.aspx)â€¦as
usual. MS is building a game specific version of VSTS called [XNA
Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/xna). From the press release, sounds
like a bunch of additional features primarily around digital asset
management. I wonder if such tools will be available to mere
non-game-coding mortals?
