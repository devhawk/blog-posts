<p>Finally got around to
<a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/blogxbrowsing.asmx/GetRss?">subscribing</a>
to <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp">Korby Parnell’s</a> blog. I met
Korby at Scoble’s last blogger’s dinner. He is a
<a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/permalink.aspx/1ce61a2c-a88b-484e-b9d8-c16f163337a3">wealth</a>
of
<a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/permalink.aspx/1ce61a2c-a88b-484e-b9d8-c16f163337a3">information</a>
on
<a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/permalink.aspx/6e856518-a69f-47b0-82f8-420d266c76c4">VSS</a>.
He’s also into Wikis, something I’m investigating as part of my new
role. I like the idea one of his readers had on a <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/PermaLink.aspx/d214eb34-9617-4ef2-86c7-db2ea53378e3">.NET doc
wiki</a>.
However, why would it need to be located at a MS-independent site?
Wouldn’t it be more powerful if MSFT set up and hosted such a site as
part of the “official” documentation?</p>
<p>Korby also
<a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/korbyp/PermaLink.aspx/14138b0e-b5a9-4366-98a0-e2a396633f0f">blogged</a>
on my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/10/06/2-great-technologies-that-taste-great-together/">entry</a>
regarding MC++ vs. C#. He did leave out the part that read: “If you’re
wrapping an existing codebase with a C or C++ API…”. Looking back, I
think I should have written “If you’re wrapping an existing codebase
that exposes a C or C++ API…”. I’m not sure it’s a law of nature, but
I’ve found it’s easier to add the managed parts to C++ than translate
the whole API into C#.</p>
