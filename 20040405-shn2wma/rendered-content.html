<p>I rewrote the script that <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/04/04/pat-mcgee-band-and-the-live-music-archive/">I blogged
about</a>
over the weekend to convert shorten files to WMA 9 lossless format.
You’ve got to have the <a href="http://etree.org/shnutils/shorten/">shorten
utility</a> on the path and have
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx">Windows Media 9
Encoder</a>
installed.</p>
<p>Download the
<a href="http://cid-0d9bc809858885a4.office.live.com/self.aspx/DevHawk%20Content/BlogFiles/SHN2WMA.zip">SHN2WMA</a> script.</p>
<p>BTW, I claimed that the WMA lossless format was half the size of
shorten’s format. Turns out that the ratio varies widely. For the
concerts I’ve converted, I’ve seen as reduction percentage between WMA
and shorten be as high as 55% and as low as 12%.</p>
