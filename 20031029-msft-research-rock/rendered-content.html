<p>I loved this morning’s keynote on research. I saw the
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss.org">SkyServer</a> stuff @ an internal research
event last year. Coolest part: you can
<a href="http://skyserver.org/myskyserver/">download</a> a slice of the database
and run it locally. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/%7EGray/">Jim Gray</a> is
sitting on the floor behind me as I blog talking about SkyServer
futures. Don just finished his session Indigo and the Future of
Distributed Computing. I guess Jim couldn’t get a seat for that.</p>
<p>A couple of people jumped on Don after the talk to discuss transactions
across services. This is a bad bad bad idea. For those @ PDC, come to
the architecture symposium tomorrow in room 152/153. My job is to
connect with the architect community so come get my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/10/13/reading-writing-and-business-cards/">business
card</a>.</p>
