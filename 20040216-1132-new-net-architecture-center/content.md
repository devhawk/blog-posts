and [Keith](http://weblogs.asp.net/kpleas/archive/2004/02/16/73954.aspx)
beat me too it (I was in a meeting), but let me blog the news anyway:
We’ve relaunched the [MSDN .NET Architecture
Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/). In addition to the
much-improved look and feel, it improves our ability to get new content
on the site. For example, we just posted the February edition of
[Architecture
Update](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/newsletter/)
featuing an article on smart clients by [David
Hill](http://weblogs.asp.net/dphill/) and a new community article by
yours truly (plus a new yet still horrific picture). We also have two
[webcasts](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/community/webcasts/default.aspx)
this week (actually, we have webcasts every week).

[Let me know](mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com) what you think of the new
design plus what other content you’d like to see up there.

BTW, I’m aware that there is no RSS feed for the new Architecture Center
yet. We’re working on that…
