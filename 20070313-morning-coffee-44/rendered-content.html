<li>I got my Tecra M4 back sans flaky motherboard. That’s my full time
laptop now – it’s nice to have a laptop that supports Vista. I’m
still running XP on my desktop out of a combination of lack of video
driver + laziness. I run dual monitor with my primary monitor
rotated to be portrait instead of landscape. Easier to read websites
and documents that way. Unfortunately, while there’s a generic WDDM
driver for my video card’s chipset, it doesn’t support the rotate
function. But according to the Dell support site, they released a
new driver for my card a few weeks ago so maybe it’s time to try the
upgrade again.</li>
<li>I sat down to watch <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/">Heroes</a> last night,
forgetting that it’s not on again until April. Watched
<a href="http://fox.com/24/">24</a> instead, but it has really <a href="http://www.jumptheshark.com">jumped the
shark</a>.</li>
<li>Scott Guthrie continues his series on new Orcas language features,
this time covering <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/03/13/new-orcas-language-feature-extension-methods.aspx">extension
methods</a>.
On the one hand, it’s pure syntactic sugar. On the other, how sweet
it is. It’s kinda surprising that no other mainstream language has
done this before.</li>
<li>Scott Hansleman is a self-described <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ManagedSnobism.aspx">managed code
snob</a>. What do
you call the opposite of a managed code snob? An unmanaged code snob
or a managed code bigot?</li>
