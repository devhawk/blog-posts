I’ve been running [Office Communicator
2007](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/communicator/HA102037151033.aspx)
(aka OC07) and the [Polycom CX200
phone](https://polycom.centercode.com/callout/default.html?callid=DF8E7030197849A39746014B5BB00670)
for a couple of weeks now. Here are a few thoughts on the experience.

-   **Multiple Points of Presence**. I’ve got OC07 installed on both my
    desktop and laptop. Unlike [WL
    Messenger](http://get.live.com/messenger/overview) with it’s “you’ve
    signed in on another machine” messages, OC07 happily lets me log in
    both places. If I get an IM, it pops up on both screens. If my phone
    rings, I can answer it on either machine.
-   **Simultaneous Ring**: When I get a call, both my machines and my
    mobile phone ring. I can answer in whatever place I want. For the
    most part, people know my mobile phone number, so I’ll need to get
    out the word to call my work number instead. (First step: re-program
    my work number in my wife’s phone.) I can also choose to forward my
    work calls directly to my mobile phone, though I tend to be better
    about checking work voice mail so I doubt I’ll use that feature.
-   **Outlook Integration**: The [previous version of
    OC](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/communicator/HA102027031033.aspx)
    had PBX system integration and Outlook. So you could call someone
    simply by right clicking on their name in Outlook, OC would talk to
    your PBX system to place the call. Unfortunately, when we moved
    offices we also got new IP phones that didn’t integrate with OC05.
    Now that I’m on OC07, my computer *is* my phone and all the Outlook
    integration works again.
-   **Status Indicator on the Phone**: It’s minor, but the USB handset
    has the OC logo that lights up the same as your status. If you’re
    available, the logo is green. Busy? The logo is red. Do Not Disturb?
    Logo flashes red. Nice touch.
-   **Missed Conversations**: The other day when I was in training, a
    colleague IMed me but I was away from my desk and my laptop was
    turned off. The IM conversation ended up in my inbox like an email.
    Doesn’t help for “You there?” IMs, but when he realized I wasn’t
    there, he just wrote the information he wanted me to know and I got
    it the next time I logged in.
-   **No Clock**: A very minor sticking point, but the old phone system
    had a clock on the phone so you could easily see what time it is,
    even if your machine is locked. The USB handset doesn’t have a clock
    and I miss it. Not nearly enough to go back to my old phone, but
    enough that I’m going to go buy a little desk clock.
-   **No Keypad**: I didn’t miss it right off the bat, but the lack of a
    keypad is a hassle. If I have to look a phone number up, having the
    ability to place the call inside of Outlook is slick. If I know the
    number off the top of my head (home, wife’s cell phone, helpdesk)
    then having to type it into Communicator is a pain. Also, if you’re
    calling one of those automated systems, keying the numbers on the
    software keypad is a real hassle.
-   **IM to Phone**: Since I have to look my wife up in Communicator to
    call her anyway, I can shoot her an IM before  call her. The kids
    nap in the afternoon, so if I catch her online, it avoids a
    potentially waking ring.
-   **Extra Speaker**: When you set up the USB phone, it sets itself up
    as the default speaker. That’s typically not what you want, but it’s
    easy enough to change in the sound control panel. However, when my
    earphones broke and I found myself sans audio, I changed it back
    until I could get new earphones. The only problem with this approach
    is that in a cube environment (like I work in), the noise from the
    phone speaker is a bit loud. You can pick up the receiver and listen
    that way without bugging your neighbors, but after about 20 seconds,
    it reverts back to speaker phone for no apparent reason.
