<p>I know <a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/12/22/focusing-on-the-now/">I

that I haven’t been dogfooding, but <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-01-01T11:26:43Z">Don’s

about programming without generics hit home. For example, look thru the
source code for <a href="http://dasblog.net">dasBlog</a> and you’ll see a ton of
hand-written type-safe collection classes that Whidbey will just
eliminate en masse. So I loaded up an older laptop with Longhorn &amp;
Whidbey. I have been more interested in Whidbey than Longhorn so far,
but I figured since I could dedicate hardware (LH runs much better on my
650MHz P3 than in a VPC on my 2GHz P4) I might as well go all the way.
Plus, an old friend who spent his Christmas vacation @ Whistler brought
me an authentic <a href="http://www.longhornsaloon.ca/">Longhorn Saloon &amp; Grill</a>
hat.</p>
