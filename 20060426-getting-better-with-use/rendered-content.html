<p>One of the topics that comes up regularly in the context of Web 2.0 is
the idea that social software gets better the more people use it. Tim
O’Reilly <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html?page=2">wrote about
it</a>
when describing Web 2.0 and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2006/03-20MIX.asp">brought it
up</a> when
he was on stage with Bill Gates at MIX06.</p>
<p>Tim called it a principle of Web 2.0. But I don’t think getting better
with use is exclusive to social software. Alan Cooper wrote about
building software that learns how the user works and optimizes itself
for that usage pattern. For example, Windows Vista has a new feature
called
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/features/foreveryone/performance.mspx#more">SuperFetch</a>
that “understands which applications you use most, and preloads these
applications into memory, so your system is more responsive when you
first boot or when you switch to a different user profile.”</p>
<p>The big difference that I see is that personal software has to be
designed to learn where social software automatically improves with use.</p>
