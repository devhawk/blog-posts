My session yesterday went very well. Current score is 7.95 which makes
it the second highest session from the track so far – John’s Realizing
SOA session currently scores an 8.17 and there are several other
sessions in the high 7′s. It’s very interesting to watch the scores
change. For example, the score for the Metropolis Discussion has gone
from 6.8 to 7.08 since yesterday.

After the session, I had a full cabaña session that felt like it
could have gone on for hours if I hadn’t cut it short in order to make
it to SeaWorld for the attendee party. The party was fun. I spent the
early part of the evening hanging out with the overall owner of this
year’s Tech·Ed, next year’s Tech·Ed, [the content owner for
Tech·Ed](http://geekswithblogs.net/dsmith/) and several of the other
track owners. Then, a la PDC, I hung out with
[Peter](http://peterprovost.org/) and started conversations with whoever
walked by. Not as many spontaneous conversations as PDC since the
audience at Tech·Ed is only half developers, but still very interesting.
Also, having the event in San Diego drew lots of families. Attendees
could buy tickets to bring their family members to the SeaWorld
party, and it looked like many people took advantage of that
opportunity. (Something to keep in mind for next year.)

It’s amazing how much work goes
into this event. Planning for [Tech·Ed
2005](https://profile.microsoft.com/RegSysProfileCenter/wizard.aspx?wizid=5f569ef5-960c-4626-bb17-ef94d15cdf50&lcid=1033)
(Orlando, FL) & 2006 (Boston, MA) is well underway and they are just
getting started on Tech·Ed 2007. Thankfully, content planning hasn’t
started yet. There’s a big internal MSFT conference in July and many of
the Tech·Ed track content owners also own content for the internal
conference, so I think content planning won’t start until at least
August or September. I was a late addition to the Tech·Ed 2004 virtual
team – I’m looking forward to being involved much earlier with next
year’s Tech·Ed. I learned a ton this year both by thrown-in-the-deep-end
experience as well as observing my fellow track owners who have done
this many times. I’m very happy with this year’s track, but I know next
year will be even better for the Architecture Track!

Today should be a easy day hanging out in the cabaña, avoiding mail and having
low-key conversations with customers. I fly out tonight – I get in late,
but I just found out I’m got upgraded to first class so at least
I’ll be comfy. The big question is whether I will watch a movie or start
hacking around with the [May VS2005
preview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/currentreadme/default.aspx).
Given my exhaustion level, I’m guessing I’ll go for a movie, but I’m
setting up a new VPC for VS2005 just in case.
