-   My two sessions on Rome went very well. Sort of like what I did @
    TechEd last month, but with a bit more kimono opening since it was
    an internal audience. Best things about doing these types of talks
    is the questions and post-session conversation. I’ve missed that
    since moving over to MSIT.
-   Late last week, I got my phone switched over to the new Office
    Communications Server 2007 beta. In my old office, I used the
    [Office Communicator PBX phone integration
    features](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/communicator/HA102027031033.aspx#2)
    extensively. However, when we moved we got new IP phones that didn’t
    integrate with Communicator. So when a chance to get on the beta
    came along, I jumped. I’ll let you know my impressions after a few
    weeks, in the meantime you can [read about Mark Deakin’s

    how to build a transactional web service that interacts with the new
    transactional file system in Vista and Server 08. Interesting, but
    personally I don’t believe in using transactional web services. The
    whole point of service orientation is to *reduce* the coupling
    between services. Trying two services (technically, a service
    consumer and provider) together in an atomic transaction seems like
    going in the wrong direction. Still, good on Matevz for digging into
    the transactional file system.
-   Udi Dahan gives us [6 simple
    steps](http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/07/19/6-simple-steps-to-becoming-a-top-it-consultant/)
    to being a “top” IT consultant. I notice that getting well known,
    speaking and publishing are at the top of the list but actually
    being good at what you’re well known for comes in at \#5 on the
    list. I’m sure Udi thinks that’s implicit in becoming a “top”
    consultant, but I’m not so sure.
-   Pat Helland thinks [Normalization is for
    Sissies](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/07/23/normalization-is-for-sissies.aspx).
    Slide \#6 has the key take away: “For God’s Sake, Don’t Normalize
    Immutable Data”.

    a new e-book from my old team called [SOA in the Real

    I flipped thru it (figuratively) and it appears to drill into the
    [Foundations of Solution
    Architecture](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa699418.aspx)
    as well as provide real-world case studdies for each of the
    ~~pillars~~ recurring logical capabilities. Need to give it a deeper
    read.
