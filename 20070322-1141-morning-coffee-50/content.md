    neutrality](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/03/is_a_neutral_ne.php):
    “Protocol is neutral. Infrastructure isn’t.” This is a more
    complicated issue than it appears on the surface.

    “Enterprise Architecture is not about ‘building solutions right’.
    Enterprise Architecture is about ‘building the right solutions’.
-   If there had been a good quote on [Nicholas Allen’s
    blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick) today, then I could declare it
    “Quote a Nick” day. Alas, his posting on how to [respond to
    GetProperty](http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/03/22/responding-to-getproperty.aspx)
    isn’t very quotable.
-   Hot on the heels of the new GAT CTP is the new [Software Factories
    Toolkit
    CTP](http://softwarefactoriestoolkit.net/Download_Feb07CTP.aspx)
    from Clarius. Among other new features is a Recipe Designer. Having
    mucked around in the Recipe XML, this is A Good Thing^TM^ (via

-   Politics 2.0 Watch: Phil de Vellis – the guy that made “[Vote
    Different](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h3G-lMZxjo)“, the Hillary
    Clinton/Apple 1984 video mashup – [said he made said
    video](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-de-vellis-aka-parkridge/i-made-the-vote-differen_b_43989.html)
    in part because he “wanted to show that an individual citizen can
    affect the process”. Furthermore, “This shows that the future of
    American politics rests in the hands of ordinary citizens.”
    Personally, Bush as Big Brother would have been more appropriate,
    but I think the video got more attention becuase it cast Hillary in
    that role.
