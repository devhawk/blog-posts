<li>I forgot to add a number to my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/08/03/morning-coffee/">last morning coffee
post</a>. However,
after extensive research, I have determined that it was #108. So
thing are continuing as usual today with #109. On the other hand,
do you really want development and architecture opinions from a guy
who can barely count?
😄</li>
<li>The finalists in the <a href="http://www.dreambuildplay.com/">Dream-Build-Play
contest</a><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/08/03/dream-build-play-finalists-announced.aspx">have been
announced</a>.
I haven’t played any of them yet (some are <a href="http://swampthingtom.blogspot.com/2007/08/congrats-to-dbp-winners.html">available for
download</a>)
but they several of them sure look good.</li>
<li>And speaking of gaming, MS
<a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/08/06/PriceDropAug8FP.aspx">announced</a>
an Xbox 360 price drop yesterday. So if you want to get in on some
of the XNA action, here’s your chance (or you could just build for
your PC – take your pick).</li>
<li>Finally on the gaming front, if you’re not busy Monday you can
<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/LetsKillDave/%7E3/141730154/gamefest-webcasts-keynote-plus-first-day-of-xna-game-studio-track.aspx">watch the first
day</a>
of <a href="http://www.xnagamefest.com/">Gamefest 2007</a> online. Get the
scoop on XNA 2.0 as well as the new XNA networking support. I, alas,
am busy Monday so I’ll have to catch it on demand.</li>
<li>On to, you know, actual geek stuff things. Scott Guthrie seems to
have retired his LINQ to SQL series and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/08/07/using-linq-to-xml-and-how-to-build-a-custom-rss-feed-reader-with-it.aspx">moved
on</a>
to LINQ to XML. He shows how to build an RSS reader application with
LINQ to XML. An oldie demo, but a goodie.</li>
<li>Wanna learn F#, there’s a <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/fsharpsamples">whole site of
samples</a> up on CodePlex. (via
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/08/03/new-codeplex-project-f-programming-samples.aspx">Don
Syme</a>)</li>
<li>Jeff Atwood is annoyed at how many different products you have to
install to get a current &amp; complete setup of VS 2005. Of course, MS
shipped two parts of that stack since VS05 shipped (TFS &amp; DBPro),
three service packs (VS05 SP1, SQL 05 SP2 and DBPro SR1) and a major
OS upgrade (VS Vista update). Doesn’t the same thing happen with any
shipping product after a few years? BTW, if this is such a huge
hassle, I wonder why Jeff doesn’t create a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2006/12/16/slipstreaming-visual-studio-2005-service-pack-1.aspx">slipstreamed VS
installer</a>?</li>
<li>Udi Dahan has a <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/08/06/dont-trust-developers-with-project-management/">great post on
estimation</a>
where he claims “Developers don’t know how to estimate.” No
argument, but the way he phrases it sounds like it’s the developer’s
fault they suck at estimation. It’s not. Developing – by definition
– is building something you’ve never built before. Is it any
surprise we suck at estimating how long it will take us to do
something we’ve never done before?</li>
