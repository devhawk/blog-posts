<p>Halloween is the time for scary movies. Julie and I have seen two since
I got back from OOPSLA – <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/">28 Days
Later…</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391198/">The
Grudge</a>. I’m not sure I would have
called 28 Days Later “Scary As Hell” but I did really like it. It had a
real plot and real characters that had real arcs. True, it also had
zombies running around, but that was much less the focus than I
expected. In fact, I think it had some thinly veiled social commentary
(that I can’t discuss w/o spoiling the movie).</p>
<p>On the other hand, The Grudge is simply a run-of-the-mill haunted house
story. Not that scary and no plot or characters worth mentioning. Simply
a series of loosely strung together scary scenes with little
consistency. Which was a bummer as it did have a great opening scene.
After all the comparisons to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/">The
Ring</a> (which I liked, though not
as much as most people) and the fact that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000600/">Sam
Raimi</a> was producing, it was very
dissappointing.</p>
<p>Of course, neither of these can compare to the potential horrors of
election fraud on Tuesday. Apparently, over 80 lawsuits have already
been filed (on both sides) which I don’t take as a good sign.</p>
