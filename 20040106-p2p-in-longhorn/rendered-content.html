<p>I realized I wasn’t going into the office today @ 6am. My wife’s school
called to let us know school was canceled. Given how hard it has been to
get my email all day, I’m guessing I’m not the only one. Since I’m not
at work or doing email, I figured I’d mess around with my new <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/01/04/eating-dogfood/">Longhorn
machine</a>.</p>
<p>I noticed browsing through the samples that Longhorn has a <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/system.net.peertopeer.aspx">managed P2P
API</a>.
The PDC build only supports PNRP and identities, which means you can’t
acually communicate with another machine via P2P (yet), but it’s nice to
see that it exists.</p>
