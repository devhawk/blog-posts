[Scott Hanselman](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/) clued me into
[PhotoBob](http://www.photobob.net/), by [Scott
Stanfield](http://www.vertigosoftware.com/AboutUs_Management.aspx) – CEO
of [Vertigo Software](http://www.vertigosoftware.com) and reigning [Iron
Developer](http://www.photobob.net/ViewPhotos.aspx?cat=VSLive%20Midnight%20Madness!&photo=Iron%20Developer%20Belt).
Built with ASP.NET, WinForm admin client talking to an XML web service,
automatic thumbnail generation – all very cool features. Looks like it
auto-resizes and it even writes copyright messages. It also includes a
Pocket PC smart client built with the [Compact
Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/device/compact.asp). The
idea of caching your photos on your PocketPC is pretty cool – 21st
century version of carrying pictures in your wallet. I’ve been thinking
of getting a new PocketPC (and a good excuse to get one) – the [Dell
Axim X5](http://www.dell.com/us/en/gen/topics/segtopic_axim.htm) looks
cool.
