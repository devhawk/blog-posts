<p>Typically, my movie tastes are further down the long tail from the big
blockbusters. I mean, I’m looking forward to movies like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/">Batman
Begins</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304/">War of the
Worlds</a>, but usually it’s the
small quirky films that get my attention. In fact, one of the reasons
I’m excited about Batman Begins is because it’s directed by Chris Nolan,
director of the awesome yet quirky independent film
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/">Memento</a>.</p>
<p>Along these lines, I saw something about a movie from Sundance called
<a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&amp;id=1808626872&amp;cf=prev">The
Aristocrats</a> by
Penn Jillette (of <a href="http://www.pennandteller.com/">Penn &amp; Teller</a>). The
premise sounds awesome:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Magician, comedian and entertainer extraordinaire Penn Jillette takes
us into the secret world of comedians as we’re introduced to a
perpetually filthy joke that is never told the same way twice, serving
as the comedy equilavent of a jazz solo since the Vaudeville days. All
that remains constant is the beginning and the end, and 105 comedians
fill in the rest. [From <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/upcoming/">Greg’s
Previews</a> on <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com">Yahoo
Movies</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aristocrats has been picked up by
<a href="http://www.thinkfilmcompany.com/">ThinkFilm</a>. I hope they get into a
theater near me, but clicking thru their site, I don’t have a lot of
confidence. The only movie currently listed on the site that I
recognized was <a href="http://www.goingupriver.com/">Going Upriver</a>, a
documentary about John Kerry that I heard about late last year during
the presidential campain. Combined with the fact that it will likely be
released “unrated” as it would likely get an NC-17 rating for langugage,
I’m thinking that I won’t see it until it gets released on DVD.</p>
