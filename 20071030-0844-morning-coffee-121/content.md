-   My daughter had her tonsils & adenoids out on yesterday. It was a
    routine procedure and it went by-the-numbers, but any parent will
    tell you it’s hard to see your kid in a hospital bed.
-   Given the previous bullet, I’m not at the [SOA/BPM
    conference](http://www.mssoaandbpconference.com/) for the [big
    announcement](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/oct07/10-30OsloPR.mspx).
    Don’t worry, there’s lots of other folks covering the news.
-   It was a crappy sports weekend in the Pierson house. Va Tech
    [snatched defeat from the jaws of
    victory](http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272980259),
    Southern Cal [never led at
    Oregon](http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273002483), the
    Capitals
    [lost](http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=271026023)
    [twice](http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=271027019),
    and the Redskins [got blown out by the
    Pats](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=271028017). At
    least the Caps [won big
    yesterday](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=271029021) in
    Toronto.
-   Speaking of the Capitals, Peter Bondra [retired
    Monday](http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?articleid=341538&page=NewsPage&service=page).
    I still think it’s [a
    travesty](http://devhawk.net/2004/02/19/doing-the-unthinkable/)
    that he didn’t spend his whole career in DC, but I’ve [made my
    peace](http://devhawk.net/2006/07/06/meeting-ted-leonsis/) with
    it.
-   Nick Malik has a [great
    series](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/10/12/soa-and-the-cisr-operating-models.aspx)
    on business operations models and how they apply to SOA. Regular
    readers should be unsurprised that I favor low standardization,
    though I can see the value of high integration. That makes the
    Coordinated Operating Model my fav, though I can see the benefit of
    the Diversified Model as well. I can’t wait to read what Nick has to
    say on changing models.
-   Speaking of Nick, I’m doing a roundtable with him on “Making SOA
    Work in the Enterprise” @ the Strategic Architect Forum. Should be
    fun. Sorry for the lack of linkage on this, but it’s an invite-only
    event.
-   Jezz Santos has a [new series of white
    papers](http://blogs.msdn.com/jezzsa/archive/2007/10/29/packaging-building-software-factories-series.aspx)
    on building software factories. First up “[Packaging with Visual
    Studio
    2005](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb880038.aspx)”
-   Aaron Skonnard has [a new
    whitepaper](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/archive/2007/10/29/48887.aspx)
    on using the WCF LOB Adapter SDK with BTS 2006 R2. I’ve been
    building one of these things recently, so I’m looking forward to
    checking that out. (via [Sam
    Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/10/29/aaron-s-wcf-adapters-in-biztalk-server-r2-paper-up.aspx))
-   Tim Ewald looks at Resource Oriented Architecture (when did ROA
    become a TLA?) and
    [wonders](http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2007/10/19/48805.aspx)
    “what if your problem domain is more focused on processes than
    data?” I wonder that all the time. (via [Jesus
    Rodriguez](http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/10/26/tim-on-roa-vs-get-and-post.aspx))
-   It’s not just durable messaging – [Libor
    Soucek](http://lsblog.wordpress.com/) also
    [disagrees](http://lsblog.wordpress.com/2007/10/26/missing-pragmatic-view-on-management-of-soa-based-system/)
    with [my
    opinions](http://devhawk.net/2007/10/25/the-worst-of-both-worlds/)
    on centralized control. I agree 100% with Libor that centralized
    management would make operation’s lives “much, MUCH easier” as he
    puts it. However, that doesn’t make it feasible at any significant
    scale. Furthermore, I wouldn’t describe an approach that requires
    that “all services adopt [the] same common management interface” as
    “pragmatic”. Frankly, just [the
    opposite](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/impractical).
