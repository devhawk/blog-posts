I’m sure lots of people are blogging a ton about PDC stuff, but I wanted
to call out two things quickly.

First is [Microsoft Max](http://www.microsoft.com/max/). I have a friend
on this team, so I’ve heard a bunch about this. Given the number of
pictures I have taken of my kids, I can’t wait to play with this in
earnest.

Second is
[LINQ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/default.aspx)
or Language Integrated Query and it’s use in [C\#
3.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/future/) and [VB
9.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/future). I started to write a
language a few years ago called Dart (named after my dog) that had
SQL-esque commands that were strongly typed. So I’m really impressed
with what they’ve acomplished in LINQ. Not only is it doing strongly
typed queries in the lanugage, they even can do joins across stores! In
the keynote demo, they joined a query of running processes with data
from a database. So now any C\# or VB developer has their – or should I
say will have their – own query processor around at the ready!
