I don’t want to turn this blog into “What weird books did .NEAT use to
as window dressing @ the SAF” but I can’t resist this one: “[Los
Negocios en la Era
Digital](http://www.allbookstores.com/book/0553061011)” by [Bill
Gates](http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/default.asp). It’s a Spanish
translation of “[Business @ the Speed of
Thought](http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speedofthought/)” though the
literal translation of the Spanish title is “Businesses in the Digital
Era”.

Speaking of Portuguese (I know, I wasn’t speaking of Portuguese, but
it’s closely related to Spanish), check out Jose Silva’s
[blog](http://canoas.com/blog/) (if you don’t speak Portuguese, check
out the AltaVista Babelfish
[translation](http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr?doit=done&urltext=http://canoas.com/blog/&lp=pt_en)).
