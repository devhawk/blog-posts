Talk about transparency: Pretty much everyone involved in the DSL
toolkit is blogging. [Keith](http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/),
[Jack](http://weblogs.asp.net/jackgr),
[Steve](http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook/),
[Stuart](http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/),
[Gareth](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/),
[Alan](http://weblogs.asp.net/alan_cameron_wills/) and
[Jochen](http://blogs.msdn.com/jochens/). Plus, I bug these guys on
email *alot* and they always have answers. A couple of recent items from
these folks:

-   Steve was
    [interviewed](http://dnjonline.com/article.aspx?ID=mar05_stevecook)
    by DNJ Online about Software Factories. I didn’t get to read this
    until yesterday afternoon, but I had to present the Microsoft
    Technology Roadmap at the Executive Briefing Center yesterday
    morning. We started talking about factories and one of the things
    that came up was the massive value of partial classes. Steve hit on
    this in his interview as well. As cool as yield, anonmous delegates
    and especially generics are, I now consider partial classes the most
    important new langugage feature in .NET 2.0. Funny, as it was
    probably the easiest to build.
-   Gareth
    [blogged](http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/archive/2005/03/15/396453.aspx)
    about a very strange bug in the March CTP release involving the
    letter ‘A’ and a slightly hacky technique for dealing with blank
    files. He also talks about the model serialization format. Sounds
    like they’ll be fixing both down the road a bit.
-   Stuart
    [confirmed](http://blogs.msdn.com/stuart_kent/archive/2005/03/18/398293.aspx)
    that there will be a version of the DSL Toolkit for Beta 2 of VS05
    “a small number of weeks” after it ships. He’s also talks about some
    of the features in the next drop: better code generation and better
    support for containment hierarchies (i.e. classes contain fields and
    methods).
-   Keith blogged a software factories [elevator
    pitch](http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2005/03/08/389777.aspx)
    and then refined the definition of a software factory into a [single
    sentence](http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short/archive/2005/03/17/397957.aspx).
