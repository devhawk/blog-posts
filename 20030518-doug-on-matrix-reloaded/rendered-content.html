<p>I think that [DevHawk] is missing a set — those who <strong>get</strong> most of
the movie (the W. brothers are good at hiding subtle things but the
core philosophic underpinnings are fairly evident) and still find the
experience lacking. I don’t hate the film, but it is far, far cry from
the original and even the AniMatrix shorts that I have seen in variety
of different areas. I will enumerate my issues sometime after I see it
again next week — since I want to reserve the right to change my
mind.<br />

<p>I was afraid of that. Doug’s forgotten more about philosophy than I will
ever know. Looking forward to your bug list.</p>
<p>I met Doug at MS 101 a little over 4 years ago. I had the longest hair,
he had the shortest. When a speaker on WinDNA didn’t show up, Doug got
up and did the talk cold.</p>
