Has it been a slow week for everyone, or just me my first week back from
vacation?

-   I got email last night from Pat Helland – he’s re-taking the red
    pill. He starts in the developer division on Monday. He asked for my
    help getting is [website](http://www.pathelland.com/) up to date, so
    look for that in the near future. In the meantime, revisit some of
    Pat’s hits:
    [Metropolis](http://www.pathelland.com/presentations/2004/powerpoint/040528-Helland-05-28-2004-02a.ppt), [Data
    on the Inside vs. Data on the
    Outside](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954587.aspx),
    [The Nerd, the Suit, and the Fortune
    Teller](http://msdn.microsoft.com/seminar/shared/asp/view.asp?url=/architecture/media/en/nerdsuitfortune/manifest.xml) and
    his greatest hit [Mr. CIO
    Guy](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=11950).
-   The new [4.0
    version](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=51a5c65b-c020-4e08-8ac0-3eb9c06996f4&DisplayLang=en)
    of the Visual Studio 2005 SDK is out. Details on [James’ vs.Eco
    blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/jameslau/archive/2007/03/01/vs-2005-sdk-4-0-rtm-is-here.aspx).
-   Next week is the [Game Developers
    Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/). About a month ago, Dave
    Weller wrote that he had “[been
    busy](http://letskilldave.com/archive/2007/02/05/Amazing-XNA-game-video_2E002E002E00_.aspx)”
    and the XNA [team blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/) has also been
    fairly silent. I have no inside information on this, but given that
    last years GDC was the first time we showed managed code running on
    an Xbox 360, the time is nigh for XNA announcements.
