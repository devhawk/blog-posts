<p>Personally, I am listening to music chosen for me by Comcast right now
and a combination subscription/buy model sounds most interesting to
me. Most music I listen to isn’t worth owning. But the RIAA doesn’t
seem particularly concerned about music listeners.<br />

<p>Scoble’s comment that most music isn’t worth owning really resonated
with me. I think we can generalize – most <em>content</em> isn’t worth owning.
Music, movies, books, etc. I find it interesting how the own vs. rent
model works in each of these independent forms of media. For example,
most people want to “own” their music, but have no problem renting
movies. Most people buy books, even though libraries are pretty
prevelent, but I wonder if that’s more related to availability. How many
popular books are at the local library to borrow?</p>
<p>I hope we see some dovetailing around the rental model across all
content types in the future.</p>
