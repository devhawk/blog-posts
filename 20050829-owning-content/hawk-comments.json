    "content": "I wouldn't say listening to the radio...satellite or otherwise...is renting. Radio is a different experience where you are not in control of which content you play. When I use Napster To Go, I can pick which music I want to listen to. With Scoble's Comcast example or satellite radio or MSN Radio for that matter, I can pick genres, but not specific content. Certainly, there's a place for both."
