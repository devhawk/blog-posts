At the Phoenix MSDN User Group Tuesday night, I mentioned ASHX files in
passing, but most of the audience hadn’t encountered them. Based on the
emails I got after the event, I decided to post an
[article](art_imagehandler.aspx) about using ASHX files to retrieve
images stored in a database to my site. I also decided to add an
“[Articles](articles.aspx)” section to put this and other articles like
it in (I moved my Add \#Region macro page into the articles section so
the ASHX article wouldn’t be alone).
