<p>I have been so focused on Web 2.0 stuff that I’ve been reading a bunch
of new blogs and disregarding the old ones I used to read. So I didn’t
realize until today that the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/DSLTools/">DSL
Tools</a> team released a <a href="http://affiliate.vsipmembers.com/affiliate/downloadfiles.aspx">new
drop</a>
last week. According to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garethj/">Gareth</a>, the
highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration into the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/extend/">Visual Studio
SDK</a>. According to the
site, they are shooting for an April release for v2 of the VS2005
SDK, so does that mean the DSL Tools will be done in April?</li>
<li>Single file format and complete visual designer for all aspects of a
DSL. I’m guessing this mean we no longer have to edit the designer
definition by hand. That’s a good thing. But I liked the seperation
of domain model and designer, so I’ll be interested to see how I
like what they’ve built.</li>
<li>Domain-specifiic model serialization. This is huge – previously, the
domain model dictated the XML serialization format. Now, if you can
customize this, you can provide a clean model syntax and even
possibly read in other syntaxes as well</li>
<li>Port Shapes and a revised modeling API</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Apparently, <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,927e400c-d23b-41b5-848d-101feb4e6371.aspx">I can’t
read</a>.
Only the VS SDK integration is done in this build. improvements to the
file format and model serialization will be in the next drop.</p>
