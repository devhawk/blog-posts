to my <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/10/19/morning-coffee-119/">comment</a>
that “Physically distributed but logically centralized” didn’t make any
sense to me at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What exactly does this mean? To some this may sound like a
contradiction.</p>
<p>This simply means that a bus is <em>physically</em> more like the
point-to-point architecture (spread out, no hub) but <em>functionally</em>
more like the hub-and-spoke architecture (pub-sub messaging,
centralized configuration and activity tracking, easy change
management).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t confused about the seeming contradictory nature
of these concepts. In other words, I understand the “what” and “how” of
David’s physically distributed/logically centralized approach.</p>
<p>I don’t understand the “why”. As in, “why would you want to do this?” or
“why do you think this would work at any significant scale?”.</p>
<p>If we check out Neudesic’s page on <a href="http://www.neudesic.com/Main.aspx?SS=7&amp;PE=75">their ESB
product</a> (which David
pointed me to) we find the following blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Centralized Management</strong><br />
The distributed nature of service oriented programming can create a
management nightmare. Neuron·ESB supports this distributed
architecture while simultaneously centralizing monitoring and
configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SOA’s “distributed nature” is it’s primary strength. SOA’s not primarily
about standards or ease-of-connectivity – though those obviously play a
role. It’s about enabling decentralized decision making. Since you can’t
be both centralized and decentralized, enforcing centralized management
basically negates SOA’s primary strength. This seems like the worst of
both worlds to me. All the hassle of distributed decision making
combined with all the hassle of centralized management.</p>
<p>Yes, decentralized decision making can create a management nightmare.
Personally, a management nightmare is much more attractive anything
centralized approaches have ever delivered in the IT industry.</p>
<p>Dare Obasanjo recently wrote “<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/10/20/IfYouFightTheWebYouWillLose.aspx">If You Fight the Web, You Will
Lose</a>“.
He was talking about the Web as a Platform, but it’s good general
advice. Can you imagine applying the marketing blurb above to the
Internet at large?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Centralized Management</strong><br />
The distributed nature of <del>service oriented programming</del> the
Internet can create a management nightmare. Neuron·ESB supports this
distributed architecture while simultaneously centralizing monitoring
and configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Internet can somehow get by without centralized management, why
can’t you?</p>
