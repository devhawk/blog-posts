<p>I’m looking forward to seeing <a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/">Simon
Fell’s</a> <a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/05/1265.html">RSS Web
Parts</a>. Makes a nice
addition to <a href="prj_sharepointsynd.aspx">WSS RSS</a> (which does work in SPS
as well). I haven’t had any time to pick through the new .NET Web Parts
technology – I’m hoping Simon releases code for his RSS web parts.</p>
