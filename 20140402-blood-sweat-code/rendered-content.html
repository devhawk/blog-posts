<p>Today was a *<strong>HUGE</strong>* thrill as I got to present in the keynote at
<a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">//build</a>! I’ll have more on the specifics
of Brokered WinRT Components later after my session, but apparently
quite a big deal was made of my shirt. I ended up as an <a href="http://cheezburger.com/8132467456">internet
meme</a> and on the <a href="http://cnntechlive.cnn.com/Event/Microsoft_Build_keynote_3/111712554">CNN Live
Blog</a>!</p>
<p>A long, long time ago (back when I wrote Photoshop Plugins for Mac long
before I joined Microsoft), I had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWarrior">Metrowerks
CodeWarrior</a> t-shirt with the
“Blood Sweat &amp; Code” slogan on the back. I loved that slogan, but lost
the shirt somewhere along the way. So a few months ago, I decided to
make a new one – but this time with the purple and blue of Visual
Studio’s brand instead of CodeWarrior yellow. When I got a chance to be
a part of the //build keynote today, I figured it was a good wardrobe
choice.</p>
<p>For those who want one of their own, I posted the <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/blood_sweat_code_shirt-235243653937823200">design on
Zazzle</a>.</p>
