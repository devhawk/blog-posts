<li>According to
<a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N2J303978.htm">Reuters</a>
surgeons who play video games are more skilled. Remind me to ask the
doctor if s/he owns an <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/">XBOX 360</a> the
next time I am getting operated on.</li>
<li>I have reached the <a href="http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfootball/">National
Championship</a> game in
dynasty mode of <a href="http://www.easports.com/ncaa07/">NCAA Football
2007</a>. The opponent of my <a href="http://www.byucougars.com/football/">BYU
Cougars</a>…why that would be
Harry’s alma mater, the <a href="http://usctrojans.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/usc-m-footbl-body.html">USC
Trojans</a>.
Funny how that worked out.</li>
<li>Nicholas Allen writes in his
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/default.aspx">blog</a> about when you
should use
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx">Indigo</a>
to write a
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/02/20/when-to-write-a-channel.aspx">channel</a>,
and more importantly when you should not. As most of you know Harry
and I are doing quite a bit of work with
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx">WCF</a>
so we are interested in this type of advice.</li>
<li>Our team has been thinking about how to manage a large number of
services in an automated fashion. This would include deploying new
services, monitoring the services, automatically handling scaling,
service discovery, and automated provisioning to name a few possible
capabilities. I almost think of it like the next version of
<a href="http://www.uddi.org/">UDDI</a>, especially when it comes to
provisioning. I think that as systems become more distributed that
the ability to automatically manage these systems is going to be key
to their success. I know that some thought has already gone on in
this area by people far smarter than I, but as I consider how to
operate an infrastructure with thousands of services in it it is
apparent that the opportunity is there for us to design and
implement a system management framework that automates the majority
of the tasks. I need to spend some time to consider how the
framework would work, and document the capabilities.</li>
