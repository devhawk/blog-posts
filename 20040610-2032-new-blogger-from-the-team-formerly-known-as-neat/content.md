It’s been a while – and a team name change - but another one of my
teammates has made the leap into the blogosphere. [John
Evdemon](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon) is a member of our vertical
industry architecture team focusing on near and long term web service
solutions as well as regulatory compliance solutions. Furthermore, he’s
a co-chair of the [OASIS BPEL
TC](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsbpel).
He [blogged a
presentation](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2004/06/09/152347.aspx)
on BPEL he did at SD West.
[Subscribed](http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/Rss.aspx) and added to my
list of [Architecture Strategy and Evangelist
Blogs](http://devhawk.net/neat.opml.aspx)

Actually, this isn’t John’s first foray into blogging – he’s got a
personal blog  [\<Well-Formed/\>](http://www.xmlhacker.org/blogs/).
There, he describes himself as “an XML hacker and standards geek for a
large software vendor.” Always nice to have a standards geek
around…Plus, he’s a big Hitchcock (his new blog is named “Vertigo”). Do
I feel a Hitch movie marathon coming on?
