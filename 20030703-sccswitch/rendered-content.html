<p>It’s late, so this will be quick. I installed GDN Workspaces Source
Control Plugin for VS.NET and then realized I couldn’t access SourceSafe
repositories any more. A little registry spelunking later, I figured out
how to switch back and forth between using GDN Workspaces and SourceSafe
for source control. In order to minimize time spent in the registry
editor, I whipped up a <a href="art_sccswitch.aspx">simple tool</a> to display the
list of installed source code control providers and allow the user to
select whichever provider they want. Enjoy.</p>
