<p>I’m on my way out the door for New Zealand and Australia, but I wanted
to push out a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>F# <del>August</del> September CTP is out! Don Syme has the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/08/29/the-f-september-2008-ctp-is-now-available.aspx">announcement</a>,
Jomo Fisher has the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jomo_fisher/pages/f-1-9-6-0-link-roundup.aspx">link
roundup</a>
and details are on the brand-spanking-new MSDN F# Dev Center. Major
congrats to the F# team. I’ve been running a pre-release version of
these bits, and they are a huge step forward if you’re an F#
developer.</li>
<li>I’ve got an <a href="http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0809071">article on
IronPython</a>
in the latest issue of CoDe magazine. Also check out <a href="http://bradwilson.typepad.com/">Brad
Wilson’s</a>
<a href="http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0809061">IronRuby article</a>,

<a href="http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0809051">F# article</a>
and <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neil Ford’s</a>

<li>Via Michael Foord I discovered that IronPython tester Dave Fugate is
<a href="http://knowbody.livejournal.com/">back on the blog</a>. He starts with
a <a href="http://knowbody.livejournal.com/6191.html">couple</a> of
<a href="http://knowbody.livejournal.com/6442.html">posts</a> about measuring
IronPython performance.</li>
<li>Speaking of blogging teammates, I think the dynamic languages team
has the highest percentage of bloggers in any group at MSFT. All
four Program Managers (<a href="http://blog.remlog.net/">Dave</a> (lead),
<a href="http://www.iunknown.com/">John</a>,
<a href="http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/">Jimmy</a> and
<a href="http://devhawk.net/">me</a>), four of five developers
(<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shrib">Shri</a> (lead),
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dinoviehland">Dino</a>,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/curth">Curt</a> and
<a href="http://www.tkachenko.com/blog/">Oleg</a>) and all three Testers
(<a href="http://blog.jredville.com/">Jim</a>,
<a href="http://knowbody.livejournal.com/">Dave</a> and
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/srivatsn/default.aspx">Srivatsn</a>). The only
non blogger right now is Tomas – who at least has a <a href="http://tmd.havit.cz/">home
page</a> – and  the lead tester which is an open
position right now. 11 bloggers out of 12 team members equals 91.67%
team blogger coverage.</li>
<li>I was really impressed with Newspeak when I <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/talks/2-01%20-%20Newspeak%20-%20Gilad%20Braha%20-%20Cadence.html">saw it at
Lang.NET</a>
so I’m very excited to see they have a <a href="http://newspeaklanguage.org/">new
website</a>. No public bits yet, but I
like the part where they point out Newspeak “can be implemented
independently of Squeak, Smalltalk or any particular VM or IDE”. How
about implementing a version on DLR guys?</li>
<li>Maurice de Beijer <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/theproblemsolver/archive/2008/08/25/using-an-ironpython-runtime-service-from-windows-workflow-foundation.aspx">shows
off</a>
embedding IronPython inside a WF application. Kinda cool, but he’s
primarily showing off implementing a CLR interface in IPy. How about
a WF activity that execute arbitrary IPy code. That would be cool.

<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ironclad/">Ironclad</a> has
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ironpy/browse_frm/thread/4baf2673c0f0afcf/6e5d15c5d01de5e">reached</a>
their 0.5 milestone, being able to import numpy from IronPython.
BTW, guys – I’m not sure commenting out one line that appears to be
unreferenced qualifies as a “monstrous caveat”. Congrats guys! (via
