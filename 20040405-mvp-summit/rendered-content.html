<p>I know a bunch of people are on campus today for the MVP summit. I’m
going to try and hang out as much as I can, but you can also come see
me. I’m in Building 22 (close to 40/41 and 42/43/44 where a lot of the
developer division is). Send me
<a href="mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com">email</a>, call me at
(425)705-6045 or just stop by my office 22/2061.</p>
