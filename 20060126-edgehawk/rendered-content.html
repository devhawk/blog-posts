<p>I got an email this morning from <a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/%7Erxv/so/soapbox.htm">Richard
Veryard</a> wondering
if I should now be called EdgeHawk. That’s funny. Alas,
<a href="http://www.edgehawk.com/">EdgeHawk.com</a> is “Your #1 internet Hoosier
Racing Tire source” so I think I’m going to stick with DevHawk…at least
for now.</p>
