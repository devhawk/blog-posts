I’ve been using [FeedReader](http://www.feedreader.com) for aggregating
news feeds, but I just downloaded and configured
[Syndirella](http://www.syndirella.net/). I think I’m going to switch
permanently since Syndirella handles some of the 2.0 RSS feeds that
FeedReader can’t. (I want to try [News
Gator](http://www.rassoc.com/newsgator/), but I’m not running a
compatible version of Outlook). Additionally, Syndirella is a .NET app,
which I like even if it has little bearing on the apps’ functionallity.
