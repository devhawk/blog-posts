<p>I’m not sure which of the post-game analysts said it, but the 2003
college football season is summed up with these words: “Any coach who
doesn’t vote USC #1 is crazy”. Congrats to
<a href="http://uscfootball.com/">SC</a> for their 28-14 victory over Michigan @
the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls03/bowl?game=rose">Rose Bowl</a>
and for winning at least a share of the national championship. Now, my
Sunday night is clear since I don’t need to watch the Nokia “Battle for
Second Place” bowl (which I
<a href="http://devhawk.net/2003/12/09/to-err-is-human/">blogged</a>
a month ago). </p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I added a link to a picture my son all decked out in his Trojan
gear and smiling wide after winning the national championship (actually,
his mother is making faces off camera).</p>
<p><strong>Another Update</strong>: I found a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jasonsalas/archive/2004/01/06/47798.aspx">great
post</a>
on the subject of the BCS by Jason Salas via <a href="http://bryan.daneman.org/?entryID=550">Bryan’s Weblog of
Stuff</a>. Jason is a .NET developer
and a sportscaster, so his views on the BCS from both sides are
facinating (though he did mix up the AP and the Coaches poll).</p>
