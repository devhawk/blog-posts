Two new architect bloggers to report. [Javed
Sikander](http://blogs.msdn.com/javeds) is an architect on the
Architecture Strategy Team focusing on RFID. He links to a
[pair](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/apr04/04-05MicrosoftRFIDPR.asp)
of
[articles](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2003/jun03/06-11rfid.asp)
about Microsoft and RFID plus provides [his
thoughts](http://blogs.msdn.com/javeds/archive/2004/11/10/255393.aspx)
on why RFID is a big deal. [David
Solivan](http://weblogs.asp.net/beaudreaux) is an architect advisor and
an ex-teammate from my old .NET Adoption Team days. So far, David
appears to be blogging at conferences. He started in July at MGB and
then went dark for a few months. He picked back up at SAF. I hear he’s
at a conference this week, so maybe we’ll see some more from him.

That brings the total number of bloggers from my team to 14. That’s over
half of the team and I know at least two more coming down the pipe.
