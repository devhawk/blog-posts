In a meeting with [Ward](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham) the
other day, he brought up the importance of URL addressability in the
context of a project we are working on. I’ve run into this issue twice
recently.

-   We just posted the streaming content for [The Architecture Strategy
    Series](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series/) on
    the [MSDN Architecture
    Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/). While I can link
    directly to the sessions, there’s a script on that page that pops
    the session up in it’s own window and checks what version of Media
    Player you have installed. If I link directly, the window resizes
    wrong and you don’t get video with the audio. So I end up linking to
    the series page instead.
-   [TechEd](http://www.microsoft.com/seminar/teched2004/default.mspx)
    just posted their list of
    [breakouts](http://www.msteched.com/content/breakouts.aspx),
    including the session I’m delivering. However, I can only link to
    the overall breakout page, not to my specific session. If you want
    to see my session, you can filter by speaker.

Suffice to say, I’ll be considering URL addressability from now on in
anything I have a hand in developing in the future.
