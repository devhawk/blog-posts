<p>They haven’t posted the article yet, but <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/default.aspx">MSDN
Magazine</a> has posted
their <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/03/default.aspx">March
Issue</a>
Preview, which will feature my first article:. <strong>Site Skinning</strong>: Rich
XML Classes Let Users Personalize Their Visual Experience on Your
ASP.NET Site. It’s about using a custom
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemwebihttphandlerclasstopic.asp">IHttpHander</a>
to build a <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/transformView.html">Transform
View</a> for an
ASP.NET website. Needless to say I’m pretty excited. I’ll be posting
additional content related to the code here on this site (hence the
recent facelift to the site – sitelift?) after the article ships. I’ve
been delivering the content at <a href="http://www.ineta.org">.NET user group</a>
meetings up and down the west coast (most recently the MSDN chapter
Phoenix) to good reviews, so I have high hopes for the article.</p>
<p>Now I just have to finish writing the second half – using CodeDOM to
actually compile the pages just like ASP.NET WebForms do. It’s amazing
how much easier writing the code is than the article that describes the
code.</p>
