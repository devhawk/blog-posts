I started reading [The Nears](http://www.thenears.com/) after
[Sean](http://blog.seanalexander.com/) linked to his
[comparison](http://www.thenears.com/index.php?p=80) of [Media Center
Extenders](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/evaluation/devices/default.mspx).
Today, there’s a great comparison of Media Center Extenders to [Windows
Media
Connect](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/devices/wmconnect/default.aspx)
devices. Very cool stuff. I’d love to have all my media on a central
machine and then be able to listen to or watch it all over the house.
The Nears linked to the [Roku
SoundBridge](http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/index.php)
which plugs into your stereo system. Supports wired or 802.11b/g
wireless in as well as analog, optical and coax audio out. Controllable
via remote control or web app. Of course, what would be truly killer is
web services support. Prices seem pretty reasonable. There are [three
different
models](http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/models.php) with
the same functionality – the only difference is the size and quality of
the display. I think I need one or two of these…
