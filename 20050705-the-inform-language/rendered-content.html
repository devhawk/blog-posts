<p>I got interested in computers when my dad started bringing home a
terminal to access his companies mainframe over a 300 baud telecoupled
modem. The first terminals were paper-based, then we moved-on-up to a
VT100. I got interested in programming because I wanted to be able to
build my own game like <a href="http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/">Adventure</a>
or <a href="http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html">Zork</a>. The rest
as they say is history and some 20-25 years later I work for Microsoft.
I never actually built an adventure game, but if I still wanted to,
apparently <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog">Rory</a> is <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/15103.aspx">teaching a
sesson</a> on
<a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org">Inform</a> which apparently is a language
for building Interactive Fiction.</p>
<p>Sounds like <a href="http://pacwest.ms/codecamp/pdx/1/">Code Camp</a> is going to
be a blast. Note to self, bug Rory for his slides.</p>
