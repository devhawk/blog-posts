    "content": "A lot of us have the same kind of story for how we started, long ago...  A hobby project which has become more than just a hobby project is our Kid's Programming Language (KPL).  It's a full-featured IDE for kids, including a simplified structured language, and a bunch of entertaining sample programs.  All aimed at encouraging and helping them learn to code, and all built on top of .NET.  It's a freeware download on our site: http://www.ms-inc.net/kpl.aspx, and feedback is more than welcome.  I will check out Inform, too.  Thanks for the link."

    "content": "The history of poker in the United States has a bit more consistency. Poker traveled from New Orleans by steamboat up the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. The game then spread via wagon and train. Modifications such as stud poker, the draw, and the straight became popular, during the Civil War. European influence of poker ended when the joker was introduced as a wild card in 1875. \n"
