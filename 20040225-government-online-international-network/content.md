While digging thru my referral logs, I found a link to a [SOA news
page](http://www.governments-online.org/webservices/searchItemsSOA.php)
from the [Government Online International
Network](http://governments-online.org/) (or GOL-IN for short). I have
no idea what this site is about, but it’s an interesting news feed on
SOA. For example, I found [this
interview](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1538806,00.asp) with Bob
Sutor, IBM’s director of WebSphere infrastructure software titled “SOA
Is So Necessary“. GOL-IN gets their
news via News Is Free, too bad then they don’t in turn provide their
own  RSS feed.
