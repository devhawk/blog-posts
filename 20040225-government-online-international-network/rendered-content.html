<p>While digging thru my referral logs, I found a link to a <a href="http://www.governments-online.org/webservices/searchItemsSOA.php">SOA news
page</a>
from the <a href="http://governments-online.org/">Government Online International
Network</a> (or GOL-IN for short). I have
no idea what this site is about, but it’s an interesting news feed on
SOA. For example, I found <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1538806,00.asp">this
interview</a> with Bob
Sutor, IBM’s director of WebSphere infrastructure software titled “SOA
Is So Necessary“. GOL-IN gets their
news via News Is Free, too bad then they don’t in turn provide their
own  RSS feed.</p>
