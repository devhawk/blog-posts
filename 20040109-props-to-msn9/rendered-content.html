<p>A bunch of people have already blogged the new
<a href="http://www.msn.com/">MSN</a>. I mean, it did launch yesterday. (I feel so
behind the times).</p>
<p>However, I have to blog on my favorite new feature â€“ <a href="http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&amp;page=features/richmail">integrated POP3
email</a>. I
started using <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>
because I wanted to keep my <a href="mailto:harry@devhawk.net">DevHawk email</a>
seperate from my <a href="mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com">work</a> and personal
email addresses. I used to use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/oe/">Outlook
Express</a> but the lack of junk mail
filtering doomed that choice (I know about tools like
<a href="http://popfile.sourceforge.net/">POPFile</a>, but I wanted a single app
solution). I also tried <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/home/office.aspx?assetid=FX01085793">Outlook
2003</a>
which had good junk mail filtering but it was bad at keeping my email
accounts seperate. The <a href="http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&amp;page=byoa/plus">MSN
Plus</a> and <a href="http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&amp;page=byoa/prem">MSN
Premium</a> both
support accessing POP3 email address, keep the email seperate from my
personal hotmail email and do a great job filtering junk. Cool!</p>
