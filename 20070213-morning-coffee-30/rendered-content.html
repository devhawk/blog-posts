that the <a href="http://puzzleware.net/download.aspx?file=/codehtmler/codehtmler.livewriterplugin.zip">CodeHTMLer WLWriter
plugin</a> does
support using the convert whitespace option. The Dialog UI is awful,
but if you select “Edit Languages” from the dropdown in the plugin
UI, you can set the UsePreTag option to false. While it is an ugly
UI (sorry, Wes) it does allow you a lot of control over how the
languages render. Not only can you change the settings for an
existing language, you can add your own custom language if you want.</li>

Taglocity into Terazen Technology Inc. Not sure why Terazen is
located in Vancouver, but maybe next time hops the pond for a visit
to his new company’s headquarters, he might take a detour a few
hours south and ramble on about architecture with a few old friends.</li>
<li>My excitement about the new season of 24 is waning quickly. Last
night’s two hours episode had so many “oh, come on!” moments that it
overwhelmed my ability to suspend belief.</li>

this on <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg7/TheDailyGrind1077.aspx">Larkware this

haven’t had time to dig personally, but it does appear related to
the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/serviceproviders/solutions/connectedservicesframework.mspx">Connected Services

And apparently there’s a contest starting in a few weeks.</li>
