Wednesday Oct 4th is the season premier for
[Lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/). Two days later on Oct 6th is
the season premier of [Battlestar
Galactica](http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/). These are my favorite two
shows – an in my opinion the best two – on TV right now. [According to
Major
Nelson](http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2006/08/28/Video_3A00_Battlestar-Galactica.aspx),
a one hour recap of BSG called “The Story So Far” is available on XBLM.
If they could post a Lost and the Lost Experience recap on XBLM, that
would just be perfect.
