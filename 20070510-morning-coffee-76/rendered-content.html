Change</a>.
He’s got other versioning advice, but that’s the main takeaway. Good
advice that dovetails nicely with “<a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,40c0cf83-27b1-49e7-8086-c57d1b5007cd.aspx">It’s the URI,
Stupid</a>“.</li>
<li>I usually agree with <a href="http://soa-eda.blogspot.com/">Jack van Hoof’s</a>
stuff, but I don’t agree with <a href="http://soa-eda.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-implement-loosely-coupled.html">his
thoughts</a>
on loosely coupled transaction processing. It’s much better than
suggesting the use of 2PC system
like <a href="http://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/10/wsat/wsat.pdf">WS-AT</a>, but
when he writes that “by design every action has a compensating
action to undo the original action” I am reminded of Pat’s old post
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2004/08/12/213552.aspx">Why I hate the phrase “Long Running
Transactions”</a>.
Personally, I’m a fan of using the Tentative Operation or
Reservation pattern,
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954638.aspx#soade_topic3">described</a>
by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/">John Evdemon</a>. Note the lack of
a transaction coordinator in that pattern.</li>
<li>Speaking of service anti-patterns, I wonder how we rationalize the
following two statements, both from Microsoft, in documents
published by my old team:
<ul>
<li>“CRUD operations are the wrong level of factoring for a Web
service. CRUD operations may be implemented within or across
services, but should not be exposed to consumers in such a
fashion. This is an example of a service that allowed internal
(private) capabilities to bleed into the service’s public
interface.” <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/">John
Evdemon</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954638.aspx">Principles of
Service Design: Service Patterns and
Anti-Patterns</a>,
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa479349.aspx">Readings in Service
Orientation</a></li>
<li>“It is very common for Entity Services to support a create,
read, update and delete (CRUD) interface at the entity level,
and add additional domain-speciic operations needed to address
the problem-domain and support the application’s features and
use cases.” <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shycohen/">Shy Cohen</a>,

<li>Ian Thomas wonders <a href="http://itblagger.wordpress.com/2007/05/04/does-erp-suck/">Does ERP
suck</a>? In
a word: Yes!
😄
Seriously, I’m a strong believer in what Ian alternatively calls
“unbundling” and “disaggregation” of monolithic enterprise systems –
ERP is the most glaring example of such systems.</li>
<li>Jamie Cansdale is <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2007/05/10/silverlight-console-applications.aspx">figuring
out</a>
how to host Silverlight’s CLR outside of the browser. He’s already
got a console runner up and running. He’s working of adding
“Test With Silverlight” option to
