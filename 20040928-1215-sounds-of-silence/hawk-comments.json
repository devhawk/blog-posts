    "content": "Oh, I kind of pictured using it like this (warning, ASCII art now follows... ;)\n\n- PurchaseOrder (Service)\n . GET (WS-T)\n . PUT (WS-T)\n * CheckStock() (service specific)\n- Foo (Service)\n . GET (WS-T)\n . PUT (WS-T)\n * Bar (service specific)\n\ni.e. the services and their data *are* typed with schemas but the actions share a kind of very simple interface type where applicable.\n\nI say again, this doesn't work for everything (i.e. a framework mindset that the client has to play in too),and you (of course) still need extra methods/actions; but where you can boil it down to services being able to 'facade' a 'resource like' business entity like a PurchaseOrder or such, then you can (a) walk up to a service a priori and have a chance at using it in context and (b) be able to aggregate the services (oh my, reporting with services, what next? :).\n\nSo all a bit too much to squeeze into a comment, but I would certainly agree that it's not 100% convincing as a set of specs, but interesting never the less...",
