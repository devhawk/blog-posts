<p>In my almost six years of working at MSFT, I’ve had one great manager
after another. I just found out one of them had a baby two months ago.
Madelyn Marie Heard was born on April 30th. Congrats to her mom
Jennifer, who was my manager two jobs ago when I was on MSFT’s National
Technology Team.</p>
