<li>Bill Gates does his last <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ces">CES</a>
Keynote, and we announce a PC that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2008/jan08/01-07fashionpcs.mspx">looks like a
purse</a>?</li>
<li>News that Warner Brothers is <a href="http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/boost-for-blu-ray-warner-bros-will-release-high-def-titles-exclusively-in-that-format/">going exclusively
Blu-Ray</a>
is disappointing. However, I’m convinced that neither side will win
this format war but that online downloads will trump both.
Obviously, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/live/marketplace/moviestv">XBLM</a> is
a significant player in this space, but the market is crowding up
quickly. Netflix apparently will <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/netflix-lg-team-up-bring/story.aspx?guid=%7B524C1C79-666C-49FD-AD1A-75E4D3B5878B%7D">unveil a new set-top
box</a>
@ CES to let you watch HD movies via the Internet.</li>
<li>Don Syme has a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/01/05/learning-wpf-through-f-and-vice-versa-by-john-liao.aspx">roundup of
posts</a>
by <a href="http://jyliao.blogspot.com">John Liao</a> about F#. Mostly, WPF +
F# with a couple of ASP.NET 2.0 posts and one on XML .</li>
<li>Speaking of F#, Stephan Tolksdorf has been working on an F# port
of MS Research’s <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/parsec.html">Parsec
library</a>
called <a href="http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/index.html">FParsec</a>. Parsec
is a “monadic parser combinator library”, something I have little
experience with, so I’ve gone back to some <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/%7Egmh//monparsing.pdf">source
research</a> on the
topic, which I hope to blog at length about soon.</li>
<li>Steve Vinoski talks about serendipitous reuse in his latest
<a href="http://computer.org/portal/pages/dsonline/2008/02/w1tow.xml">Internet Computing
article</a>.
I’m not a believer in reuse in the enterprise, serendipitous or
otherwise, but I liked the conclusion to Steve’s article when he
wrote “It’s highly ironic that many enterprise architects seek to
impose centralized control over their distributed organizations. In
many cases, such centralization is a sure recipe for failure.” Also,
his point that “control without controlling” works sounds <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/10/25/the-worst-of-both-worlds/">vaguely
familiar</a>.</li>
