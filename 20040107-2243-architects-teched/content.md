My team owns the architect track for [TechEd
2004](http://www.microsoft.com/teched). We’re hoping to build on the
very successful Architecture Symposium from PDC. As part of that effort,
I own that community efforts for the architect track. I’m working on the
plan now. Obviously, we’ll have “the usual” events: Ask the Experts,
Birds of a Feather, Speaker Lounge, Attendee Party, etc. Any other
suggestions? Please [email me](mailto:hpierson@microsoft.com) or leave a
comment.
