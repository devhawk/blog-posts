<p>I think TechEd 2005 is shaping up to be awesome again this year. They
just posted the list of
<a href="http://www.msteched.com/content/sessions.aspx">sessions</a> (well, most of
the sessions anyway). I can’t link directly to the architecture
sessions, but you can filter the list to show just one track at a time
if you want to. We haven’t got speakers or abstracts posted yet, but I
can tell you that we’ve got some good speakers lined up like
<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott</a>,
<a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog">Ted</a>,
<a href="http://objectwatch.com/">Roger</a>,
<a href="http://www.lhotka.net/WeBlog/">Rocky</a>, and
<a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/">Steve</a>.</p>
<p>Of the ARC track sessions, I think I’m most looking forward to “Building
and Using a Software Factory”. I jokingly call this session “Here’s the
Beef, Chris Sells”. Chris
<a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1577">blogged</a>
that he wanted a concrete example of a software factory. It turns out
that we’ve been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/archive/2004/10/27/248491.aspx">working on a concrete
example</a>
since before OOPSLA. In the TechEd session, we’ll see how far
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mglehman/">Michael</a>,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jackgr">Jack</a> and
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short">Keith</a> have gotten since October.</p>
