<p>I normally keep this blog clear of personal and political commentary,
saving that talk for my <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/devhawk">personal blog on MSN
Spaces</a>. But this time I had to make an
exception. Check out this awesome picture of my daughter Rileyanne in a
field of buttercups. Isnâ€™t she cute? ðŸ˜„</p>
