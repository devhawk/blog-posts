<p>FYI, for those going to <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/sf/" title="VSLive! in San Francisco">VSLive! in San
Francisco</a>,
I’m a last minute addition to the schedule. I’m presenting a talk titled
<a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/sf/sas-sessions.aspx#transformationbest" title="Developer 2.0: Finding Your Way in the Future of Software Development">Developer 2.0: Finding Your Way in
the Future of Software
Development</a>.
I wrote and delivered this presentation originally for the <a href="http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2005X.aspx" title="patterns &amp; practices Summit">patterns &amp;
practices
Summit</a>
back in December. It was the second-highest rated talk of the summit
(after Anders’ LINQ keynote) so I’m excited to be delivering it again.
I’m hoping to get a high-quality recording so I can publish it (I
recorded the p&amp;p summit version with my laptop. You can hear it but I
wouldn’t say it’s “high quality”). The session is at 5:45pm on Tuesday.
I’ve been told it’s in room 2016/2018, but you should double check when
you get there if you’re interested in going.</p>
