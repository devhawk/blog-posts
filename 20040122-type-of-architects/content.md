Traditionally, our team has divided architects into three categories:
Strategic, Application and Infrastructure. Gurpreet Pall, of [MSA
Enterprise Data
Center](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/edc/rak/msaedc.asp)
fame and the new head of our Architecture Strategy team, suggested a
different categorization scheme: Component, System and
System-of-Systems. I like this scheme because it is more hierarchical
where the scopes of strategic, application and infrastructure architects
have small intersections.

Gurpeet’s scheme is also interesting in that component architects of
system-of-systems architects don’t typically have much to talk about.
Component architecture is below the abstraction layer for
system-of-systems architects.

I’m not suggesting one view is better than the other, they are both
interesting views into the same space. However, I’d like a better term
than “system-of-systems architect”.
