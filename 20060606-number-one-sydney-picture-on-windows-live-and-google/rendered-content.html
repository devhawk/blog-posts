<p>I typically don’t <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/devhawk.net">search Technorati for incoming
links</a> because a
significant number of the links to my blog come from my inclusion on
dasBlog’s default blogroll. For example, “<a href="http://www.dredlog.com/nssucks/">Dutch Railways
Suck</a>” doesn’t appear to have anything
to do with architecture, development or hockey, but they still link to
me. However, in checking out Technorati today, I discovered several
blogs were linking to me that were out of the ordinary to say the least.
Turns out that this picture I took on <a href="http://devhawk.net/2004/08/15/back-in-all-blacks/">my trip to Australia two years
ago</a> is the number one
result when searching both <a href="http://www.live.com/#q=sydney&amp;scope=images">Windows Live Image
Search</a> and <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=sydney&amp;hl=en">Google Image
Search</a>.</p>
<p>I’m guessing that’s why this picture shows up on the blog of <a href="http://ckhnat.blogspot.com/2006/05/cast-it-on-waters.html">woman
trying to reverse the trends of
feminism</a>, a
<a href="http://sellinganimage.blogspot.com/2006/05/you-are-plague.html">guy who despises
Sydney</a>,
a
<a href="http://spaces.msn.com/markopasu/Lists/cns!5E117D8B714C025B!288/">couple</a>
of <a href="http://blogs.aol.fr/mpeyrotte/Rachel/entries/492">french</a> blogs that
I can’t read and two german blogs – one <a href="http://ach-ciao.blogspot.com/2006/05/sydney-im-coming.html">I can’t
read</a> and
one <a href="http://daniel-does-madison.blogspot.com/2006/05/visa-incident.html">that I
can</a>.</p>
