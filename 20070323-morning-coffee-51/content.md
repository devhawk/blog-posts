    part](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Devhawk/~3/102926655/VSTDB+Where+Have+You+Been+All+My+Life.aspx)
    of the Visual Studio – won a [JOLT

-   When they’re older, I’d like to send my kids to [Tinkering
    School](http://www.tinkeringschool.com/blog/). Come to think of it,
    I’d like to go with them to Tinkering School. According to
    [Geekdad](http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2007/03/tinkering_camp.html),
    they’re looking helping others set up their own Tinkering Schools. I
    wonder if [Jules](http://techiewife.spaces.live.com/) would be down
    to help me run one?
-   [Sandboxie](http://www.sandboxie.com/) is a sandbox environment for
    your windows based PC. Basically, it traps writes to the filesystem
    and registry and stores them in a seperate file that is easily
    tossed away. Sort of like virtual machine differencing drives, but
    for your host machine. I’ll have to check it out. I wonder how it
    [compares](http://www.softricity.com/products/virtualization.asp) to
    Microsoft’s recent aqusition
    [Softricity](http://www.softricity.com/)? (via [Larkware
    News](http://www.larkware.com/dg8/TheDailyGrind1105.aspx))
-   I didn’t realize [Bug Bash](http://www.bugbash.net) had an external
    website. As per the [about page](http://www.bugbash.net/about/), Bug
    Bash started “a comic strip in the company newsletter of a large
    northwest software company…[who's] name rhymes with ‘Microsoft’.” It
    is a hilarious Dev/IT focused comic strip from the same guy who
    writes [Mr. Cranky](http://www.mrcranky.com/).
