<p>It was a little too cold to make a snowman at my house, so we headed
over to the big hill near our house for a little sledding. The hill was
pretty trashed – we weren’t the first ones to down the hill – but we all
had a fun time nonetheless.</p>

<p>And here’s Patrick, riding by himself like a big boy:</p>
<p>Riley calls Patrick “Bubba” because she can’t say “brother”.</p>

<p>On top of all this snow play and sledding, I got my STS working with
WCS. More on that tomorrow.</p>
