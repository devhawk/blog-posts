<p>As I <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/10/09/hawkeye-on-standard-wcf-bindings/">wrote this
morning</a>,
I’m in training this week. The instructor (who I wrote earlier is
“pretty good”) is <a href="http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon/">Jon
Flanders</a>. I didn’t
recognize his name, but I did recognize his <a href="http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/atlasworkflowdesigner/">Atlas based WF
Designer</a> that
he released a month and a half ago or so. It’s a cool piece of work so
it’s doubly cool (for me anyway) that he’s teaching this class.</p>
