I’m sure I’m the last blogger to watch
[Don’s](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/) [MSDN
TV](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20030827SOAPDB/manifest.xml)[episodes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20030902SOAPDB/manifest.xml)
on SOA. But if I’m not, go watch them right now. I especially like Don’s
comments on XML Schema. They echo my own, but are much more coherent.
Plus, it makes me glad I’ve never swapped out a CPU.
