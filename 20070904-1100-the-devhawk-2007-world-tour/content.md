After spending almost all of fiscal year 07 (July ’06 thru June ’07)
*not* traveling and *not* presenting, I’m going to be doing a few public
talks to finish out the year. If you, dear reader, are going to one of
these please [drop me a line](mailto:harry.pierson@microsoft.com).
Invariably, it’s the side meetings and discussions that are the most
valuable at these conferences.

**[IT Architect Regional Conference 2007](http://www.iasahome.org/web/socal/itarc2007)**\
October 15th – 16th, San Diego, CA

I’m a huge fan of [IASA](http://www.iasahome.org), so I’m thrilled to be
doing their west regional conference. I’ve presented to a packed house
for the local chapter before, so I think these folks will put on a good
conference. They sure have a good selection of [topics and
speakers](http://www.iasahome.org/web/itarc/socal/topics).

My session is called “[Moving Beyond Industrial
Software](http://www.iasahome.org/web/itarc/socal/topics#HarryPierson)“.
Here’s the abstract:

> Computers have been instrumental in ushering in the post-industrial
> age. Yet, most enterprises today are run with an industrial mindset
> and the IT department is organized like a factory. This creates a
> tension between the forces of industrialization that define the
> organization and the forces of post-industrialization that define
> today’s marketplace. For example, our post-industrial world is
> becoming more decentralized by the day. Yet many organizations believe
> the key to a successful service oriented architecture – a very
> decentralized system design – is to have a central service repository.
>
> In this session, Harry Pierson will examine this tension, get you
> thinking outside the industrial mindset and help you think about
> software development in a post-industrial way.

I’m very excited about this talk.

[**MS SOA & Business Process
Conference**](http://www.mssoaandbpconference.com/)\
October 29th – November 2nd, Redmond, WA

I’m not presenting at MSSOABPC (that’s a mouthful) but looks like most
of my team is going. So if you’re going and want to hang out with the
guys who are doing this stuff in the trenches @ MSIT, let me know. Also,
[I put out the call](http://devhawk.net/2007/08/03/morning-coffee/)
for anyone interested in a geek dinner. From the
[agenda](http://www.mssoaandbpconference.com/agenda.htm), looks like
they’re keeping us busy until 8pm every night Mon-Wed, so we can either
a) have geek dinner Thursday or Friday or b) have geek beers after one
of the receptions in the early part of the week.

[**patterns & practices Summit USA
West**](http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2007.aspx)\
November 5th – 9th, Redmond, WA

I did the p&p Summit back in 2005, a very successful debut of my
Developer 2.0 talk. (I’m doing that talk at a different conference this
year, details below.) This year, I’m not 100% sure what I’m going to
talk about yet. I’m currently slated to talk about the Rome project that
I’m doing in MSIT, but given our current slow progress on that project,
I’m probably going to talk about something else. I’m thinking either the
“Moving Beyond Industrial Software” talk described above or the “Facing
the Fallacies of Distributed Computing” talk described below. Any other
suggestions?

[**DevTeach Vancouver 2007**](http://devteach.com/)\
November 26th – 30th, Vancouver, BC

This is a brand new experience for me. Frankly, I’d never heard of
DevTeach before my friend [Mario
Cardnial](http://www.mariocardinal.com/blog/) suggested I submit a
couple of sessions. Since it’s only a few hours drive away, I’m bringing
the family along. We’ll see how that goes. And when I’m not doing my
sessions or hanging out with the family, I might take in a session or
two in the [XNA track](http://devteach.com/Session.aspx#79).

Here are the sessions I’m doing:

> [**Developer 2.0\
> Finding Your Way in the Future of Software
> Development**](http://devteach.com/wconnect/wc.dll?FournierTransformation~1,5,1,1017)\
> The one constant in software development is change. Software
> development in 2007 is dramatically different than it was in 2000,
> which was in turn dramatically different than in 1993. You can be
> guaranteed that the platforms, languages, and tools will continue to
> evolve. Learn how Harry Pierson, Architect in Microsoft IT, believes
> software development is going to evolve in the next five years and
> what you must do today to remain competitive.

> **[Facing the Fallacies of Distributed
> Computing](http://devteach.com/wconnect/wc.dll?FournierTransformation~1,5,1,1019)**\
> Sun Fellow Peter Deutsch is credited with authoring “The Eight
> Fallacies of Distributed Computing”. These are near-universal
> assumptions about distributed systems that “All prove to be false in
> the long run and all cause big trouble and painful learning
> experiences.” In this session, we will examine these fallacies in
> depth and learn how to avoid them on the Windows platform by
> leveraging Web Services, WCF and SQL Service Broker.
