    "content": "I remember having trouble with monads until I understood that monads made things quasi-imperative by taking advantage of the fact that in order to evaluate the body of a function, you have to evaluate the parameters first.\n\nSo, imperative form:\n\nfunction1(state); function2(state); function3(state);\n\nAnd monadic form:\n\nfunction3(function2(function1(state), state), state)\n\nSomething like that, anyway. The point being, in both forms function1 must execute before function2, which must execute before function3.",
