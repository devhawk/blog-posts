<p>Coming in June, hot on the heels of TechEd is the <a href="http://www.architecturewebcasts.com/default.aspx?id=8VY6XG9623">Architecture Webcast
Series</a>.
This is a series of four webcasts in June and July of architectural
topics such as service orientation and reusable frameworks. In addition
to the valuable content, you’ll also get a free <em><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/practices">patterns &amp;
practices</a></em> book and get entered
into a drawing for a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/portablemediacenter/default.mspx">portable media
center</a>.
Here are the webcasts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Connecting Your Business with Service Orientation</strong><br />
This webcast invites you to delve into the Microsoft vision for
service orientation and service-oriented architecture in enterprise
computing. Discover the benefits that service orientation can bring to
your business and how service orientation can play an integral role in
developing connected systems. You’ll also become more familiar with
Microsoft offerings and initiatives in the area of service
orientation. And you’ll come away with practical guidance on how and
where you should invest in the skills and technologies needed to
capitalize on the short- and medium-term promise of service
orientation.<br />

<p><strong>Creating a Shared Technology Vision</strong><br />
Increasing business complexity and rapid industry changes are
forcing IT and business executives to look for new ways of leveraging
technology. Executives must become enablers for strategic innovation
and sustainable competitive advantage (top line) rather than just
operational efficiency (bottom line). The paths to business
flexibility and innovation run through enterprise architecture that
can allow companies to decompose their strategies, processes, and
technologies into a set of services using proven theoretical
frameworks and service-oriented architecture (SOA). Learn more about
this effective and simple approach that can bridge the business-IT
alignment gap and inspire the creation of the shared technology
visions that can power real-time, event-driven network organizations
of the twenty-first century.<br />

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Value of Reusable Frameworks</strong><br />
Frameworks provide the building blocks of component-oriented
application development through inheritance, abstract types,
interfaces, and design patterns. Microsoft and Avanade have been
working together to create a set of common application blocks and
provide these blocks in an extensible and reusable manner. This joint
effort has resulted in the release of Enterprise Library, a set of
reusable software components designed to assist developers with common
enterprise development challenges, such as Security, Data Access,
Instrumentation, Exception Handling, and Caching. In addition, Avanade
has extended Enterprise Library with a set of advanced application
blocks for implementing Aspect-Oriented Programming and
Service-Oriented Architecture called ACA.NET. This webcast will
provide an overview of the architecture of Enterprise Library and
ACA.NET, and discuss the design patterns that were used to implement
the application blocks.<br />

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Examining Enterprise Service Patterns</strong><br />
The demands you face to produce aggregated views of business
information and automate business processes are more intense than ever
before. You have to deliver on these demands to assist in the growth
of the business while at the same time driving down the cost of IT by
commoditizing integration, aggregation, and process management in a
complex heterogeneous environment. In this session, we’ll examine a
common set of enterprise service design patterns for commoditizing
integration, aggregation, and business process management. We’ll
consider J2EE, Microsoft .NET and host environments.<br />
