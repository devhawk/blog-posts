Does anyone know if there’s an RSS feed for
[KurzweilAI.net](http://www.kurzweilai.net)? I got a rare opportunity to
hear him speak yesterday as part of a Microsoft event and he was
amazing. (I wonder if he got more sleep than [Chris
Anderson](http://www.simplegeek.com/) did?) I’ve started on his book
[The Age of Spiritual
Machines](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0140282025)
(which I’ve had for a year and never found time for) and I was picking
through the massive amount of information on his
[website](http://www.kurzweilai.net). But I want to keep up to date and
an RSS feed is (obviously) the easiest way to do that.
