Simply copy the view to a new name and make sure to select the bottom option, so the view becomes available to all Mail/Post foldes. Then, when you are in the search folder, all you have to do is select the new view! \n\nRegards,\nPeter Bruinsma\nintraVnews",

That stated, if your like any of the 'softies I know, you'll have reams of un-read items, so this doesnt work so well. To get around this you can setup a unread folder that only shows items below a parent folder (like a root feeds folder).\n\nTo move between items with just they keyboard, just hit space. This scrolls & moves to next unread item.",

(by defaul, it will search for mail in Personal Folders, we'll fix that in a sec)\n\nClick OK.  (Outlook will create the folder and start running the query.)\n\nNow, right click on the newly created search folder, probably called \"Unread Mail1\"\n\nSelect \"Customize this Search Folder\"\n\nClick Browse.\n\nUncheck Personal Folders.\n\nCheck intraVnews.\n\nClick OK\n\nYou can then name this something like \"Unread Blogs\"\n\nNow your email and blogs are completely separate.",
