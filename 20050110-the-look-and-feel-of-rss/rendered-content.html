about how he chose what blog service to use. His criteria were: 1) ease
of use and 2) look of the final product. (Of course, look of the final
product was important to Norman – he’s in marketing!) As a developer and
architect, I originally cared most about “rolling my own”, though I
switched over to dasBlog about a year ago. (I just don’t have the time
to roll-my-own as often as I used to.) However, given that I had
invested significant effort into the look of my final product, that
factor was important to me as well, which is one of the reasons I chose
dasBlog over .TEXT.</p>
<p>Of course, what’s funny about investing so much time thinking about the
blog template is that I think most people read the site via RSS, not
HTML. Chris Anderson of “The Long Tail” <a href="http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/blog_design_in_.html">wrote about
this</a>
a while back. Maybe I should invest a little effort into the new
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblogce">dasBlog Community Edition</a>
effort – I’d like to see the number of times the RSS feed is downloaded
vs. the number of times the home page is downloaded.</p>
<p>Norman further goes on to discuss the fact that his blog is hosted on
Blogger, which of course is now owned by Google. I like his point that
“Interoperability and mixed environments is the way the world works. If
it is good enough for my customers, it is good enough for me.”</p>
