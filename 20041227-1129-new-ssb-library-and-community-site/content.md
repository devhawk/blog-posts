A couple of weeks ago, Paul Murphy pointed me at a [SSB Wrapper
Class](http://devhawk.net/2004/12/10/ssb-wrapper-class/)
that’s included in one of the SQL 2005 Beta 2 sample apps. That prompted
an email from the SSB dev lead with a much better SSB library that they
had written. You can get that
[library](http://www.sqlservicebroker.com/forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=31),
along with
[two](http://www.sqlservicebroker.com/forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=33)
[new](http://www.sqlservicebroker.com/forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=32)
samples that use it, up on the [SQL Server Service Broker Developers
Spot](http://www.sqlservicebroker.com/forums). The SSB Dev Spot is a
community site dedicated to apps written on top of SSB. It’s run by [Dan
Sullivan](http://www.develop.com/us/technology/bio.aspx?id=66) of
Developmentor, who is also hosting [his new
blog](http://www.sqlservicebroker.com/forums/default.aspx?ForumGroupID=7)
on the site. I hear Dan and fellow DM-ers [Bob
Beauchemin](http://staff.develop.com/bobb/weblog/default.aspx) and
[Niels Berglund](http://www.develop.com/us/technology/bio.aspx?id=67)
are all very excited about SSB. Nice to know I’m not the only one.
