    "content": "I'd like to see an open and royalty-free license for the entire factory markup.  My recent experiences with the application of a closed system were very uncomfortable.\n\nI'd love to see industry adoption of the idea, but I'd hate to see any projects lose steam because all of the people who hold the vision for it are too busy convincing the non-believers.  If it's a truly powerful tool (and I believe it will be), I think the benefits will make themselves clear and they'll eventually switch to what works.  Meanwhile, the owners and users of the tool can construct far better solutions than they ever could before.\n"
