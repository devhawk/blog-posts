Cool thing about blogs – sometimes I learn about stuff happening inside
the big house from outside in blogs. Case in point –
[Scott](http://scottwater.com/Blog/)[pointed
out](http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2004/07/22/12704.aspx) to the
[Lookout download](http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/download.html). I
also found out about the [COmega
site](http://www.research.microsoft.com/Comega/) from
[Don](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/) (though honestly, I knew
about that one before. That is before it changed names.)

**Update**: Lookout’s [download
site](http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/download.html) changed, back to
a page on http://lookoutsoft.com instead of a page on
http://download.microsoft.com. Strange, but true.
