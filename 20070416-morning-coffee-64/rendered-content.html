<li>I took my son to the <a href="http://pacsci.org/">Pacific Science Center</a>
this past weekend to see the <a href="http://www.pacsci.org/grossology/">Grossology
exibit</a>. His favorite was the
barfing machine, but we also got to play Urine: The Videogame, stand
inside a giant nose, work the burping machine, climb the scab wall
and slide down the throat into the stomach and come out thru the
colon. We also checked out the dinosaur exibit (Patrick’s favorite
part: petrified dino poop), Kids Works and the Peter and the Wolf
laser show. It was awesome.</li>
<li>This week’s Big News<sup>TM</sup> is the rebranding of WPF/E as
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight">Silverlight</a>. Tim Sneath has
the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2007/04/15/introducing-microsoft-silverlight.aspx">rundown</a>,
including the news that more news about Silverlight is coming at
<a href="http://www.visitmix.com/">MIX</a>. Personally, I think Silverlight is
a great name. I was worried it was going to be another W*F name.
(I’m waiting for the day that MSFT marketing tries to rebrand Win32
as the Windows Technical Foundation).</li>
<li>Gianpaolo Carraro writes about what happens when a SaaS company
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gianpaolo/archive/2007/04/15/saas-company-biting-the-dust-and-idea-for-a-new-startup-i-think.aspx">bites the
dust</a> -
i.e. “what happens to my data?” I expect that this is one of the
aspects of SaaS that you have to weigh, though I doubt most
companies will explicitly think about what happens if their SaaS
provider goes belly up. As the SaaS market expands and more
companies will go belly up (I agree w/ GP 100% that this isn’t SaaS
specific, rather a natural force of any market) how much will that
drag on SaaS adoption? I’m thinking it’ll be a fairly significant
drag, but the SaaS market will eventually rebound.</li>
<li>Nick Malik picks up the decentralization meme is <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/04/13/morning-coffee-63/">started last
Friday</a> and
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/04/14/is-central-planning-impossible.aspx">compares</a>
enterprise architecture to city zoning boards. In general, I agree
with Nick’s “not in a vacuum and not with a heavy hand” comment, but
even more with his point that “we haven’t figured all it out yet.”
Most EA efforts I’ve seen have been heavy handed and fairly divorced
from reality (aka in a vacuum). More on this topic in the future.</li>

loop</a>
on city planning with a reference to Pat Helland’s
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480026.aspx">Metropolis</a>
work. Pat’s work has been a huge influence on me. I often repeat
Pat’s point about cities being “interconnected yet independent”.
Services need to be interconnected yet independent also.</li>
<li>Roger Wolter has a new <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb410798.aspx">Master Data Management

out, this one MDM hubs. I was literally talking about MDM on a conf
call this morning, so Roger’s timing is impeccable.</li>
<li>I haven’t read <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/2007/03/the_radar_archi.html">RADAR
Architecture</a>
yet, but the fact that DAR in the acronym stands for “Dumb-Ass
Recipient” made me laugh. (via <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/SamGentile/%7E3/109318225/New-and-Notable-157.aspx">Sam

<li>MIT Media Lab has cointed the latest 2.0-ism: <a href="http://h20.media.mit.edu/">Human
2.0</a>. I love Nick Carr’s <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/04/mit_announces_h.php">take on
it</a>:
“We’re definitely overdue for an upgrade – it seems like we’ve been
stuck in Version 1.x for a few hundred thousand years, and that was
after a beta that went on for freaking ever. Still, I think I’ll
probably hold off until 2.01 or 2.02. I don’t want to be on the
bleeding edge for this one.”</li>
