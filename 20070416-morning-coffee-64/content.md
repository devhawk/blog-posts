-   I took my son to the [Pacific Science Center](http://pacsci.org/)
    this past weekend to see the [Grossology
    exibit](http://www.pacsci.org/grossology/). His favorite was the
    barfing machine, but we also got to play Urine: The Videogame, stand
    inside a giant nose, work the burping machine, climb the scab wall
    and slide down the throat into the stomach and come out thru the
    colon. We also checked out the dinosaur exibit (Patrick’s favorite
    part: petrified dino poop), Kids Works and the Peter and the Wolf
    laser show. It was awesome.
-   This week’s Big News^TM^ is the rebranding of WPF/E as
    [Silverlight](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight). Tim Sneath has
    the
    [rundown](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2007/04/15/introducing-microsoft-silverlight.aspx),
    including the news that more news about Silverlight is coming at
    [MIX](http://www.visitmix.com/). Personally, I think Silverlight is
    a great name. I was worried it was going to be another W\*F name.
    (I’m waiting for the day that MSFT marketing tries to rebrand Win32
    as the Windows Technical Foundation).
-   Gianpaolo Carraro writes about what happens when a SaaS company
    [bites the
    dust](http://blogs.msdn.com/gianpaolo/archive/2007/04/15/saas-company-biting-the-dust-and-idea-for-a-new-startup-i-think.aspx) -
    i.e. “what happens to my data?” I expect that this is one of the
    aspects of SaaS that you have to weigh, though I doubt most
    companies will explicitly think about what happens if their SaaS
    provider goes belly up. As the SaaS market expands and more
    companies will go belly up (I agree w/ GP 100% that this isn’t SaaS
    specific, rather a natural force of any market) how much will that
    drag on SaaS adoption? I’m thinking it’ll be a fairly significant
    drag, but the SaaS market will eventually rebound.
-   Nick Malik picks up the decentralization meme is [started last
    Friday](http://devhawk.net/2007/04/13/morning-coffee-63/) and
    [compares](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/04/14/is-central-planning-impossible.aspx)
    enterprise architecture to city zoning boards. In general, I agree
    with Nick’s “not in a vacuum and not with a heavy hand” comment, but
    even more with his point that “we haven’t figured all it out yet.”
    Most EA efforts I’ve seen have been heavy handed and fairly divorced
    from reality (aka in a vacuum). More on this topic in the future.
-   Kirk Evans [closes the
    loop](http://blogs.msdn.com/kaevans/archive/2007/04/16/solution-architect-vs-enterprise-architect-central-planning.aspx)
    on city planning with a reference to Pat Helland’s
    [Metropolis](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480026.aspx)
    work. Pat’s work has been a huge influence on me. I often repeat
    Pat’s point about cities being “interconnected yet independent”.
    Services need to be interconnected yet independent also.
-   Roger Wolter has a new [Master Data Management
    whitepaper](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb410798.aspx)
    out, this one MDM hubs. I was literally talking about MDM on a conf
    call this morning, so Roger’s timing is impeccable.
-   I haven’t read [RADAR
    Architecture](http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/2007/03/the_radar_archi.html)
    yet, but the fact that DAR in the acronym stands for “Dumb-Ass
    Recipient” made me laugh. (via [Sam
    Gentile](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/04/15/New-and-Notable-157.aspx))
-   MIT Media Lab has cointed the latest 2.0-ism: [Human
    2.0](http://h20.media.mit.edu/). I love Nick Carr’s [take on
    it](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/04/mit_announces_h.php):
    “We’re definitely overdue for an upgrade – it seems like we’ve been
    stuck in Version 1.x for a few hundred thousand years, and that was
    after a beta that went on for freaking ever. Still, I think I’ll
    probably hold off until 2.01 or 2.02. I don’t want to be on the
    bleeding edge for this one.”
