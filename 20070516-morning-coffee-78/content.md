    a much longer version of “[Even though the runtime supports multiple
    languages, most programmers are only fluent in
    one](http://devhawk.net/2007/05/15/afternoon-coffee-77/).” (via

-   I wrote yesterday that Pat Helland’s first post back was light on
    the tech talk. Luckily (for us) he takes the bus to work so he has
    plenty of time to write blog entries. [Today’s
    post](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/05/15/memories-guesses-and-apologies.aspx)
    is his “personal opinion about how computers suck”. Money Quote: “We
    try too hard as an industry.  Frequently, we build big and expensive
    datacenters and deploy big and expensive computers. In many cases,
    comparable behavior can be achieved with a lot of crappy machines
    which cost less than the big expensive one.”

    CRAP](http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/2007/05/crud-is-crap.html).
    I agree 100%, but for additional reasons. Not only is it boooooring
    to write, it also delegates control *outside* of the service which I
    think is a mistake. Check out [this
    post](http://blogs.msdn.com/maarten_mullender/archive/2004/07/23/193524.aspx)
    from Maarten Mullender who advised to do CRUD only when you can
    afford it.
-   MIT Media Lab has created [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) “a new
    programming language that makes it easy to create your own
    interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art — and share
    your creations on the web” targeted at kids 8 and up. It’s a dynamic
    visual programming language that looks like Lego. Between Scratch,
    [Boku](http://on10.net/Blogs/laura/techfest-07-boku/) and
    [Phrogram](http://phrogram.com) I think my kids will have lots of
    fun learning to program like daddy does. (via

-   Halo 3 is coming [September
    25th](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/05/15/AreYouReadyforHalo.aspx)!
    I foresee lots of people calling in sick that day. And the next. And
    the rest of the week, etc. etc. etc.
