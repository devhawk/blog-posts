CBA</a></p>
<p>NEW YORK/TORONTO (July 13, 2005) – The National Hockey League and the
National Hockey League Players’ Association have reached an agreement
in principle on the terms of a new Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
<p>Details of the new Agreement will not be made available publicly
pending the formal ratification process by the NHLPA Members and the
NHL Board of Governors.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the ratification process will be completed next
week, at which time the parties will be prepared to discuss the
details of the Agreement and plans for next season. No further comment
will be made until then.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Obviously, the NHL has to do ALOT to recover from missing last
season. Apparently, HDTV is one of the things they are thinking about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NHL, which claims that hockey fans are the most technologically
savvy of all pro sports fans, will focus a portion of its marketing
energies on the cyber world. It will also work to improve the at-home
experience for an ever-waning television audience, employing new
camera angles, microphones on players and coaches and the use of high
definition television production.</p>
<p>“The opportunities that exist for us with high definition television
are enormous,” [NHL Group VP of Communications Bernadette] Mansur
said.</p>

<p>I’m hard pressed to say that getting HDTV would make the lockout “worth
it” but it sure would lessen the sting.</p>
