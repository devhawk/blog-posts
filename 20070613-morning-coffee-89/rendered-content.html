I’ve used this product off and on over the past few years.
Typically, I would use it, love it, but then never get around to
reinstalling it after a repave since it was subscription-only
product. </li>

have no doubt that the cool kids will deem it “not hot” in favor of

<li>Ted Neward <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/06/12/The+Relational+Database+Needs+No+Defense.aspx">writes at
length</a>
about relational databases, object databases and OR mapping. Ted may
be Switzerland when it comes to platform, but he has <em>no</em> problem
taking sides and mixing it up when it comes to data &amp; object
persistence. He makes some interesting points that mostly boil down
to “different tools for different jobs”. Also, has the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2006/03/28/the-dual-schema-problem/">dual schema
problem</a> entered
the general vernacular, or just Ted’s?</li>
<li>Nick Malik <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/12/showing-up-can-be-the-hardest-part.aspx">survives his
trip</a>
to Nashville and has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/12/martin-fowler-wants-to-see-ruby-on-microsoft-to-save-the-alpha-geek.aspx">some
thoughts</a>
on Ruby, Microsoft and alpha geeks. His point about the alpha geek
track record (he sites Powerbuilder, Delphi and EJB) is spot on.
This is something I’ve been thinking about since
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/et2006/">ETech</a> last year. How
good are alpha geeks at trendspotting? For every technology they
adopt that makes the mainstream, how many don’t? I’m guessing quite
a few more than the three Nick mentions.</li>
<li>Speaking of alpha geeks, this whole
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/12/showing-up-can-be-the-hardest-part.aspx">ALT.NET</a> silliness
reminds me of the famous Groucho Marx quote: “I don’t want to belong
to any club that will accept me as a member.” Though maybe I’m just
bitter because “Working at MS” has been deemed “<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2007/06/04/alt-net-alternative-tools-and-approaches-to-mainstream-net.aspx">not
hot</a>”.
