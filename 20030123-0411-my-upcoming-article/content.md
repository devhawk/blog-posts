They haven’t posted the article yet, but [MSDN
Magazine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/default.aspx) has posted
their [March
Issue](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/03/default.aspx)
Preview, which will feature my first article:. **Site Skinning**: Rich
XML Classes Let Users Personalize Their Visual Experience on Your
ASP.NET Site. It’s about using a custom
[IHttpHander](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemwebihttphandlerclasstopic.asp)
to build a [Transform
View](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/transformView.html) for an
ASP.NET website. Needless to say I’m pretty excited. I’ll be posting
additional content related to the code here on this site (hence the
recent facelift to the site – sitelift?) after the article ships. I’ve
been delivering the content at [.NET user group](http://www.ineta.org)
meetings up and down the west coast (most recently the MSDN chapter
Phoenix) to good reviews, so I have high hopes for the article.

Now I just have to finish writing the second half – using CodeDOM to
actually compile the pages just like ASP.NET WebForms do. It’s amazing
how much easier writing the code is than the article that describes the
code.
