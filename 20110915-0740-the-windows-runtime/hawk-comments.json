    "content": "I’m just wondering how the HTML5/JavaScript Metro applications will be packaged and protected against reversal …\n For packaging I’ll expect some sort of signed zip/jar (no mention about .appx on MSDN) but for protection, outside of heavy obfuscation for JavaScript I can’t envision any other way (maybe a new precompiled/binary format ?)\n If the protection is not good, writing HTML5/JavaScript apps will not flourish to much IMHO.\n\nSince the Metro documentation state that the applications are self-consistent (no shared DLL’s, etc), I’m just wondering how you can create a modular, BIG Metro application by creating reusable components/libraries … Another issue that bother me relate to the library reuse, since the Metro documentation state that the applications are self-consistent (no shared DLL's, etc), so I'm just wondering how you can create a modular, BIG Metro application by creating reusable components/libraries ... \n\nIf all the HTML5/JavaScript Metro apps should contain the same CSS and WinJS scripts then it doesn't look quite good ... I expected some form of libraries/reuse to exist from the start.\n\nDo you have more details for all of these ?\n\nBTW, all the HTML5/JavaScript way of programming Metro apps remind me about Opera widgets that you can build for several years now",
