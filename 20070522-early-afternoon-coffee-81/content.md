These morning meetings are really cramping the “morning” style of these
posts. But better late than never, I guess.

    about integrating SSB with WF, something I’ve experimented with
    myself. I didn’t find the integration quite as natural as Roger did
    – transactions are a real PITA, and Roger apparently he hasn’t
    looked into that yet - but I agree 100% with the idea that “most SSB
    programs end up looking a lot like a workflow.” Looking forward to
    seeing your code, Roger.

    [explains](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/05/20/soa-and-newton-s-universe.aspx)
    his Newton vs. Einstein view of distributed systems and then rants
    about Consistency, Availability and Partition-tolerance. In
    particular, he discusses the evolution of what consistency (and to
    less extent availability) means in the face of loose coupling. Do
    yourself a favor and give up on distributed transactions *now*.
    Also, Pat points to [another paper from
    CIDR](http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2007/papers/cidr07p36.pdf)
    dealing with isolation in services. Haven’t read it yet, but I’ve
    added it to “the pile”.

    about Service Component Architecture vs. Service Oriented
    Architecture. Since I don’t “do” evangelism anymore, I don’t spend
    much time watching what our competitors are doing. According to the
    [SCA
    website](http://www.osoa.org/display/Main/Service+Component+Architecture+Home),
    SCA is supposedly a “a model for building applications and systems
    using a Service-Oriented Architecture.” But according to David, SCA
    1.0 focuses on “portability, not interoperability, and so they don’t
    fully define the interactions between components necessary to create
    composites that cross vendor boundaries.” I realize that we don’t
    industry agreement on all the details of what SOA means, but I think
    we all agree that it’s cross platform and cross vendor. Or maybe we
    can’t even agree on that much.
